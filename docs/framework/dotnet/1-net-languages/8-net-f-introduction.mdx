# .NET F# Introduction

## What is F#?

F# (pronounced "F sharp") is a mature, open-source, cross-platform programming language in the .NET family. It was developed by Microsoft Research and is now maintained by the F# Software Foundation and Microsoft. F# is a **functional-first** language, which means it encourages a style of programming that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions.

Key characteristics of F#:

- **Concise syntax** that reduces code complexity
- **Strong type system** that helps prevent many common bugs
- **First-class functions** that can be passed as values
- **Immutable values** by default, reducing side effects
- **Pattern matching** for elegant handling of data structures
- **Full integration** with the .NET ecosystem

## Why Learn F#?

Learning F# offers several advantages:

1. **Cleaner code** - F# programs typically require fewer lines of code than equivalent C# or VB.NET programs
2. **Fewer bugs** - The type system and immutability help prevent entire classes of errors
3. **Increased productivity** - Features like type inference reduce boilerplate code
4. **Seamless .NET interoperability** - Use any .NET library directly from F#
5. **Data science and AI** - Excellent for working with data and implementing machine learning algorithms

## Setting Up F#

To get started with F#, you'll need the .NET SDK installed on your system. You can download it from [dotnet.microsoft.com](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download).

Once installed, you can create a new F# project:

```bash
dotnet new console -lang F# -o MyFirstFSharpApp
cd MyFirstFSharpApp
```

This creates a new F# console application. Let's look at the default program file (`Program.fs`):

```fsharp
// Learn more about F# at http://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/fsharp

open System

// Define a function to construct a message to print
let from whom =
    sprintf "from %s" whom

[<EntryPoint>]
let main argv =
    let message = from "F#" // Call the function
    printfn "Hello world %s" message
    0 // return an integer exit code
```

To run this program:

```bash
dotnet run
```

**Output:**
```
Hello world from F#
```

## Basic F# Syntax

### Variables and Functions

In F#, you define values and functions using the `let` keyword:

```fsharp
// Define a value
let greeting = "Hello, world!"

// Define a function
let add x y = x + y

// Using the function
let sum = add 5 3
printfn "Sum: %d" sum
```

**Output:**
```
Sum: 8
```

Notice that:
- F# uses type inference, so you don't need to declare types explicitly
- Function parameters are separated by spaces, not commas
- Parentheses are often optional

### Immutability

By default, values in F# are immutable, which means they cannot be changed after they're defined:

```fsharp
let name = "John"
// name <- "Jane"  // This would cause a compilation error
```

To create mutable values, you use the `mutable` keyword:

```fsharp
let mutable count = 0
count <- count + 1  // This is valid
printfn "Count: %d" count
```

**Output:**
```
Count: 1
```

### Collections

F# has several built-in collection types:

```fsharp
// Lists
let fruits = ["Apple"; "Banana"; "Orange"]

// Arrays
let numbers = [| 1; 2; 3; 4; 5 |]

// Sequences
let evens = seq { 2..2..10 }

// Tuples
let person = ("John", 30)

// Accessing elements
printfn "First fruit: %s" fruits[0]
printfn "Second number: %d" numbers[1]
printfn "Person name: %s, age: %d" (fst person) (snd person)
```

**Output:**
```
First fruit: Apple
Second number: 2
Person name: John, age: 30
```

## Pattern Matching

Pattern matching is a powerful feature in F# that allows you to match values against patterns and execute code based on the match:

```fsharp
let describeNumber n =
    match n with
    | 0 -> "Zero"
    | 1 -> "One"
    | 2 -> "Two"
    | n when n < 0 -> "Negative"
    | _ -> "Many"  // Default case

[1..3] |> List.map describeNumber |> List.iter (printfn "%s")
printfn "%s" (describeNumber -5)
```

**Output:**
```
One
Two
Many
Negative
```

## Piping and Function Composition

F# uses the `|>` operator (pipe) to chain function calls, making code more readable:

```fsharp
// Without piping
let result1 = List.sum (List.filter (fun x -> x % 2 = 0) [1..10])

// With piping
let result2 = 
    [1..10] 
    |> List.filter (fun x -> x % 2 = 0) 
    |> List.sum

printfn "Sum of even numbers: %d" result2
```

**Output:**
```
Sum of even numbers: 30
```

## Real-World Example: Data Processing

Let's create a more practical example that processes a list of orders:

```fsharp
// Define types for our domain
type Product = {
    Name: string
    Price: decimal
}

type Order = {
    OrderId: int
    Products: Product list
}

// Sample data
let products = [
    { Name = "Laptop"; Price = 999.99m }
    { Name = "Mouse"; Price = 25.50m }
    { Name = "Keyboard"; Price = 45.75m }
    { Name = "Monitor"; Price = 159.99m }
]

let orders = [
    { OrderId = 1; Products = [products[0]; products[1]] }
    { OrderId = 2; Products = [products[2]] }
    { OrderId = 3; Products = [products[0]; products[3]; products[1]] }
]

// Calculate total price for each order
let calculateOrderTotal (order: Order) =
    order.Products 
    |> List.sumBy (fun p -> p.Price)

// Find orders above a certain amount
let findExpensiveOrders threshold =
    orders
    |> List.filter (fun o -> (calculateOrderTotal o) > threshold)
    |> List.map (fun o -> o.OrderId)

// Print results
orders 
|> List.iter (fun o -> 
    printfn "Order #%d total: $%.2f" o.OrderId (calculateOrderTotal o))

let expensiveOrders = findExpensiveOrders 200.0m
printfn "\nExpensive orders (>$200): %A" expensiveOrders
```

**Output:**
```
Order #1 total: $1025.49
Order #2 total: $45.75
Order #3 total: $1185.48

Expensive orders (>$200): [1; 3]
```

## F# and Object-Oriented Programming

While F# is functional-first, it fully supports object-oriented programming as well:

```fsharp
// Define a class
type Person(name: string, age: int) =
    // Properties
    member this.Name = name
    member this.Age = age
    
    // Method
    member this.Greeting() =
        sprintf "Hi, I'm %s and I'm %d years old." name age
        
    // Static method
    static member CreateAdult(name) = Person(name, 18)

// Create instances
let john = Person("John", 30)
let adult = Person.CreateAdult("Jane")

// Use the instances
printfn "%s" (john.Greeting())
printfn "%s" (adult.Greeting())
```

**Output:**
```
Hi, I'm John and I'm 30 years old.
Hi, I'm Jane and I'm 18 years old.
```

## Asynchronous Programming

F# has excellent support for asynchronous programming with its `async` workflow:

```fsharp
// Simulate an asynchronous operation
let fetchDataAsync url = 
    async {
        printfn "Fetching data from %s..." url
        do! Async.Sleep 1000 // Simulate network delay
        return sprintf "Data from %s" url
    }

// Execute async operations in parallel
let fetchAllData() =
    let urls = ["https://example.com/api/users"; "https://example.com/api/products"]
    urls
    |> List.map fetchDataAsync
    |> Async.Parallel
    |> Async.RunSynchronously

// Run the example
let results = fetchAllData()
Array.iter (printfn "%s") results
```

**Output:**
```
Fetching data from https://example.com/api/users...
Fetching data from https://example.com/api/products...
Data from https://example.com/api/users
Data from https://example.com/api/products
```
