# C# Variables

## Introduction

Variables are fundamental building blocks in any programming language, including C#. They act as containers that store data in computer memory, allowing you to work with different types of information in your programs. In C#, variables are strongly typed, which means every variable must have a declared data type that determines what kind of data it can hold.

This guide will walk you through everything you need to know about C# variables, from basic declarations to best practices.

## Variable Declaration and Initialization

### Basic Syntax

In C#, you declare variables using the following syntax:

```csharp
dataType variableName;
```

And initialize them like this:

```csharp
dataType variableName = value;
```

Or you can separate declaration and initialization:

```csharp
dataType variableName;
variableName = value;
```

### Examples

Here's a simple example of declaring and initializing an integer variable:

```csharp
int age = 25;
Console.WriteLine("Age: " + age);

// Output:
// Age: 25
```

You can also declare multiple variables of the same type in a single line:

```csharp
int x = 10, y = 20, z = 30;
Console.WriteLine($"x: {x}, y: {y}, z: {z}");

// Output:
// x: 10, y: 20, z: 30
```

## C# Data Types

C# offers various built-in data types to handle different kinds of information. Here are the most common ones:

### Value Types

| Data Type | Description | Range | Example |
|-----------|-------------|-------|---------|
| `int` | 32-bit signed integer | -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647 | `int count = 42;` |
| `float` | 32-bit floating-point | ±1.5 × 10^-45 to ±3.4 × 10^38 | `float price = 19.99f;` |
| `double` | 64-bit floating-point | ±5.0 × 10^-324 to ±1.7 × 10^308 | `double distance = 456.789;` |
| `decimal` | 128-bit precise decimal | ±1.0 × 10^-28 to ±7.9 × 10^28 | `decimal money = 125.45m;` |
| `char` | Single 16-bit Unicode character | U+0000 to U+FFFF | `char grade = 'A';` |
| `bool` | Boolean value | `true` or `false` | `bool isActive = true;` |

### Reference Types

| Data Type | Description | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| `string` | Sequence of characters | `string name = "John Doe";` |
| `object` | Base type of all types | `object data = 42;` |
| Arrays | Collection of values | `int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3};` |
| Classes | User-defined types | `Person person = new Person();` |

### Example with Different Types

```csharp
// Value types
int age = 30;
double height = 5.9;
bool isEmployed = true;
char grade = 'A';
decimal salary = 5000.50m;

// Reference types
string name = "Alice Johnson";
int[] scores = { 85, 90, 78, 92, 88 };

Console.WriteLine($"Name: {name}, Age: {age}");
Console.WriteLine($"Height: {height}ft, Grade: {grade}");
Console.WriteLine($"Is employed? {isEmployed}");
Console.WriteLine($"Salary: ${salary}");
Console.WriteLine("Scores: " + string.Join(", ", scores));

// Output:
// Name: Alice Johnson, Age: 30
// Height: 5.9ft, Grade: A
// Is employed? True
// Salary: $5000.50
// Scores: 85, 90, 78, 92, 88
```

## Type Inference with `var`

C# allows you to use the `var` keyword for implicit typing, where the compiler determines the variable's type based on the assigned value.

```csharp
var message = "Hello, World!"; // Compiler infers it as string
var number = 42;               // Compiler infers it as int
var pi = 3.14159;              // Compiler infers it as double

Console.WriteLine($"{message} The answer is {number} and PI is {pi}");

// Output:
// Hello, World! The answer is 42 and PI is 3.14159
```

**Important**: When using `var`:
- You must initialize the variable at declaration
- The type is determined at compile-time, not runtime
- It doesn't make the variable loosely typed

## Constants

When you have values that should never change during program execution, you can use constants:

```csharp
const double Pi = 3.14159;
const string AppName = "My C# Application";

// Attempting to modify a constant will result in a compilation error
// Pi = 3.14; // This would cause an error

Console.WriteLine($"Application: {AppName}");
Console.WriteLine($"Pi value: {Pi}");

// Output:
// Application: My C# Application
// Pi value: 3.14159
```

## Variable Scope

The scope of a variable defines where in the code you can access that variable. C# has several scope levels:

### Block Scope

Variables declared within a code block (enclosed by `{}`) are only accessible within that block.

```csharp
{
    int blockVariable = 100;
    Console.WriteLine($"Inside block: {blockVariable}");
}
// Console.WriteLine(blockVariable); // Error: blockVariable doesn't exist here
```

### Method Scope

Variables declared in a method are accessible only within that method.

```csharp
void ExampleMethod()
{
    int methodVariable = 200;
    Console.WriteLine($"Inside method: {methodVariable}");
}
// methodVariable is not accessible outside the method
```

### Class Scope (Fields)

Variables declared at the class level (fields) are accessible throughout the class.

```csharp
class Person
{
    // Class-level variable (field)
    private string name = "John";
    
    public void PrintName()
    {
        Console.WriteLine(name); // name is accessible here
    }
    
    public void ChangeName(string newName)
    {
        name = newName; // Can modify the field
    }
}
```

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: Temperature Converter

```csharp
// Temperature converter using variables
Console.Write("Enter temperature in Celsius: ");
double celsius = Convert.ToDouble(Console.ReadLine());

double fahrenheit = (celsius * 9 / 5) + 32;

Console.WriteLine($"{celsius}°C = {fahrenheit}°F");

// Example output with input "25":
// Enter temperature in Celsius: 25
// 25°C = 77°F
```

### Example 2: Simple Interest Calculator

```csharp
// Simple interest calculator
decimal principal = 1000m;
decimal rate = 0.05m;  // 5% annual interest
int time = 2;          // 2 years

decimal interest = principal * rate * time;
decimal amount = principal + interest;

Console.WriteLine($"Principal: ${principal}");
Console.WriteLine($"Interest Rate: {rate * 100}%");
Console.WriteLine($"Time Period: {time} years");
Console.WriteLine($"Simple Interest: ${interest}");
Console.WriteLine($"Total Amount: ${amount}");

// Output:
// Principal: $1000
// Interest Rate: 5%
// Time Period: 2 years
// Simple Interest: $100
// Total Amount: $1100
```

### Example 3: User Information Program

```csharp
// Program to collect and display user information
Console.Write("Enter your name: ");
string userName = Console.ReadLine();

Console.Write("Enter your age: ");
int userAge = Convert.ToInt32(Console.ReadLine());

Console.Write("Enter your height (in meters): ");
double userHeight = Convert.ToDouble(Console.ReadLine());

bool isAdult = userAge >= 18;

Console.WriteLine("\nUser Information:");
Console.WriteLine($"Name: {userName}");
Console.WriteLine($"Age: {userAge}");
Console.WriteLine($"Height: {userHeight}m");
Console.WriteLine($"Is adult: {isAdult}");
Console.WriteLine($"Birth year (approx.): {DateTime.Now.Year - userAge}");

// Example output with inputs "Sarah", "22", "1.65":
// Enter your name: Sarah
// Enter your age: 22
// Enter your height (in meters): 1.65
//
// User Information:
// Name: Sarah
// Age: 22
// Height: 1.65m
// Is adult: True
// Birth year (approx.): 2001
```

## Best Practices

1. **Use Meaningful Names**: Choose descriptive names for variables that explain what they represent.
   ```csharp
   // Poor naming
   int x = 86400;
   
   // Better naming
   int secondsInDay = 86400;
   ```

2. **Follow Naming Conventions**:
   - Use camelCase for local variables and parameters (`firstName`)
   - Use PascalCase for constants (`MaxValue`)
   - Avoid using reserved keywords as variable names

3. **Initialize Variables**: Always initialize variables before using them to avoid unexpected behaviors.

4. **Limit Variable Scope**: Declare variables in the narrowest scope possible.

5. **Use Constants**: For values that shouldn't change during runtime.

6. **Choose the Right Type**: Select the most appropriate data type for your needs to optimize memory usage.
