# .NET CLI

## Introduction

The .NET Command Line Interface (CLI) is a cross-platform tool that allows developers to create, build, test, run, and publish .NET applications directly from the command line. It's an essential tool for .NET developers as it provides a fast and efficient way to work with .NET projects without requiring a full-fledged Integrated Development Environment (IDE).

Whether you're working with C#, F#, or Visual Basic, the .NET CLI provides a consistent experience across different operating systems including Windows, macOS, and Linux. This makes it an incredibly versatile tool for modern development workflows.

## Getting Started with .NET CLI

### Installation

Before using the .NET CLI, you need to install the .NET SDK (Software Development Kit). You can download it from the [official .NET website](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download).

To verify your installation, open a terminal or command prompt and run:

```bash
dotnet --version
```

This command should display the installed .NET SDK version:

```
7.0.306
```

### Basic Structure of .NET CLI Commands

All .NET CLI commands follow this pattern:

```
dotnet [command] [arguments] [options]
```

Where:
- `dotnet` is the command-line driver
- `command` is the .NET CLI command you want to execute
- `arguments` are specific to the command
- `options` are flags that modify the command's behavior

## Essential .NET CLI Commands

### Getting Help

One of the most useful commands to remember is the help command:

```bash
dotnet --help
```

This displays a list of available commands and brief descriptions. You can also get help for specific commands:

```bash
dotnet new --help
```

### Creating New Projects

The `new` command creates new projects, configuration files, and solution files based on templates:

```bash
dotnet new console -n MyFirstApp
```

This command creates a new console application named "MyFirstApp". The output will look something like:

```
The template "Console App" was created successfully.

Processing post-creation actions...
Running 'dotnet restore' on MyFirstApp\MyFirstApp.csproj...
  Determining projects to restore...
  Restored MyFirstApp\MyFirstApp.csproj (in 112 ms).
Restore succeeded.
```

Common project templates include:
- `console` - Console application
- `classlib` - Class library
- `web` - ASP.NET Core empty web application
- `webapi` - ASP.NET Core Web API
- `mvc` - ASP.NET Core Model-View-Controller application
- `razor` - Razor Page application

To see all available templates:

```bash
dotnet new list
```

### Building Projects

To compile your application:

```bash
dotnet build
```

A successful build looks like:

```
Microsoft (R) Build Engine version 17.6.8+c70978d4d for .NET
Copyright (C) Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.

  Determining projects to restore...
  All projects are up-to-date for restore.
  MyFirstApp -> C:\Projects\MyFirstApp\bin\Debug\net7.0\MyFirstApp.dll

Build succeeded.
    0 Warning(s)
    0 Error(s)

Time Elapsed 00:00:01.57
```

### Running Projects

To run your application:

```bash
dotnet run
```

If your project has multiple files, you can specify the project:

```bash
dotnet run --project MyFirstApp.csproj
```

### Publishing Projects

To create a production-ready version of your application:

```bash
dotnet publish -c Release
```

The `-c Release` flag specifies a Release configuration, which optimizes the code for production use.

## Managing Solutions and Projects

### Creating Solutions

A solution is a container for organizing related projects:

```bash
dotnet new sln -n MySolution
```

### Adding Projects to Solutions

After creating a solution, you can add projects:

```bash
dotnet sln MySolution.sln add MyFirstApp/MyFirstApp.csproj
```

### Managing NuGet Packages

To add a package reference:

```bash
dotnet add package Newtonsoft.Json
```

To restore packages for a project:

```bash
dotnet restore
```

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: Creating and Running a Simple Console Application

Let's create a simple "Hello World" application:

```bash
dotnet new console -n HelloWorld
cd HelloWorld
```

Examine the Program.cs file, which should contain:

```csharp
// See https://aka.ms/new-console-template for more information
Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
```

Run the application:

```bash
dotnet run
```

Output:
```
Hello, World!
```

### Example 2: Working with a Multi-Project Solution

Let's create a solution with a class library and a console app that uses it:

```bash
# Create a solution
dotnet new sln -n LibraryDemo

# Create a class library
dotnet new classlib -n MathLibrary
cd MathLibrary

# Edit the class library to add functionality
```

Now modify the `Class1.cs` file in the MathLibrary project:

```csharp
namespace MathLibrary
{
    public class Calculator
    {
        public int Add(int a, int b)
        {
            return a + b;
        }
        
        public int Subtract(int a, int b)
        {
            return a - b;
        }
    }
}
```

Continue with creating the console application:

```bash
cd ..
dotnet new console -n CalcApp

# Add projects to the solution
dotnet sln LibraryDemo.sln add MathLibrary/MathLibrary.csproj CalcApp/CalcApp.csproj

# Add a reference from CalcApp to MathLibrary
dotnet add CalcApp/CalcApp.csproj reference MathLibrary/MathLibrary.csproj
```

Now modify the `Program.cs` file in the CalcApp project:

```csharp
using MathLibrary;

// Create a calculator instance
Calculator calc = new Calculator();

// Use the calculator
int sum = calc.Add(5, 3);
int difference = calc.Subtract(10, 4);

// Display results
Console.WriteLine($"5 + 3 = {sum}");
Console.WriteLine($"10 - 4 = {difference}");
```

Run the application:

```bash
cd CalcApp
dotnet run
```

Output:
```
5 + 3 = 8
10 - 4 = 6
```

### Example 3: Creating a Simple Web API

Let's create a basic Web API:

```bash
dotnet new webapi -n SimpleApi
cd SimpleApi
```

Examine the generated code, then run the API:

```bash
dotnet run
```

You'll see output showing the API is running, typically at `https://localhost:5001` and `http://localhost:5000`. You can access the Swagger UI for the API by navigating to `https://localhost:5001/swagger` in your browser.

## Advanced .NET CLI Features

### Global Tools

The .NET CLI supports global tools, which are special NuGet packages that can be installed and run from any directory:

```bash
dotnet tool install -g dotnet-ef
```

This installs the Entity Framework Core command-line tools globally.

### Creating Custom Templates

You can create your own templates for use with `dotnet new`:

```bash
dotnet new -i <PATH_TO_YOUR_TEMPLATE>
```

## Common Workflows with .NET CLI

### Testing

Create a test project:

```bash
dotnet new xunit -n MyTests
```

Run tests:

```bash
dotnet test
```

### Continuous Integration

In CI environments, you often need to build and test without user interaction:

```bash
dotnet build --no-incremental --no-restore
dotnet test --no-build
```

## Summary

The .NET CLI is a powerful, cross-platform tool that simplifies the development process for .NET applications. It allows you to:

- Create new projects from templates
- Build, run, and publish applications
- Manage solutions and projects
- Work with NuGet packages
- And much more!

Learning to use the CLI effectively can significantly improve your productivity as a .NET developer, especially when working in environments where a full IDE is not available or when automating build processes.
