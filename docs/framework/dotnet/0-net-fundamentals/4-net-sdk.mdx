# .NET SDK

## Introduction

The .NET Software Development Kit (SDK) is a set of libraries, tools, and runtime components that developers use to create applications for the .NET platform. It provides everything you need to build and run .NET applications on Windows, macOS, and Linux. 

Whether you're building web applications, mobile apps, desktop applications, cloud services, or IoT solutions, the .NET SDK provides the foundation for your development journey. This guide will walk you through the basics of the .NET SDK, its components, and how to start using it in your projects.

## What is the .NET SDK?

The .NET SDK is a collection of tools, libraries, and frameworks that enable developers to build applications for the .NET platform. It consists of:

1. **The .NET CLI (Command Line Interface)** - A cross-platform toolchain for developing .NET applications
2. **The .NET Runtime** - The environment that executes .NET applications
3. **Libraries and Frameworks** - Reusable components and APIs for common functionality
4. **Language Compilers** - For C#, F#, and Visual Basic

The SDK follows a versioning scheme that corresponds to the .NET platform versions, such as .NET 6 SDK, .NET 7 SDK, etc.

## Installing the .NET SDK

Before you start developing .NET applications, you need to install the .NET SDK on your machine.

### Step 1: Download the SDK

Visit the [official .NET download page](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download) and select the version that suits your needs. For beginners, it's recommended to choose the latest LTS (Long-Term Support) version.

### Step 2: Run the Installer

Follow the installation wizard to complete the setup. The default options are usually sufficient for most developers.

### Step 3: Verify the Installation

After installation, open a terminal or command prompt and run:

```bash
dotnet --version
```

This command should display the installed .NET SDK version, confirming that the installation was successful:

```
7.0.306
```

## Key Components of the .NET SDK

### 1. .NET CLI (Command Line Interface)

The .NET CLI is a powerful command-line tool that allows you to create, build, test, run, and publish .NET applications. Here are some essential commands:

#### Creating a New Project

```bash
dotnet new console -n MyFirstApp
```

This command creates a new console application named "MyFirstApp" with the basic structure and files.

#### Building a Project

```bash
cd MyFirstApp
dotnet build
```

This builds the project and its dependencies.

#### Running a Project

```bash
dotnet run
```

This builds and then runs the application.

### 2. Project Templates

The .NET SDK includes various templates for different project types:

```bash
dotnet new --list
```

Output:
```
Template Name                        Short Name        Language
-----------------------------------  ----------------  ----------
ASP.NET Core Empty                   web               [C#]
ASP.NET Core Web App (MVC)           mvc               [C#], F#
ASP.NET Core Web API                 webapi            [C#], F#
Console Application                  console           [C#], F#, VB
Class Library                        classlib          [C#], F#, VB
... (and many more)
```

### 3. NuGet Package Manager

The SDK includes NuGet, the package manager for .NET, which allows you to incorporate third-party libraries into your projects:

```bash
dotnet add package Newtonsoft.Json
```

This adds the popular JSON processing library to your project.

## Practical Example: Creating and Running a Simple Console Application

Let's create a simple "Hello World" application to demonstrate the basic workflow:

### Step 1: Create a New Console Application

```bash
dotnet new console -n HelloWorldApp
cd HelloWorldApp
```

### Step 2: Examine the Project Structure

The SDK creates the following basic structure:
- `Program.cs` - The main source code file
- `HelloWorldApp.csproj` - The project file that contains metadata
- `obj/` and `bin/` directories - For build artifacts

### Step 3: Look at the Default Code

Open `Program.cs` in your text editor. By default, it contains:

```csharp
// See https://aka.ms/new-console-template for more information
Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
```

### Step 4: Run the Application

```bash
dotnet run
```

Output:
```
Hello, World!
```

### Step 5: Modify and Run Again

Let's modify the application to personalize it:

```csharp
// See https://aka.ms/new-console-template for more information
Console.Write("Enter your name: ");
string name = Console.ReadLine() ?? "there";
Console.WriteLine($"Hello, {name}! Welcome to .NET development!");
```

Run the application again:

```bash
dotnet run
```

Interactive Output:
```
Enter your name: John
Hello, John! Welcome to .NET development!
```

## Real-World Application: Working with Files and JSON

Let's create a more practical example that demonstrates working with files and JSON parsing:

### Step 1: Create a New Project

```bash
dotnet new console -n FileProcessor
cd FileProcessor
```

### Step 2: Add the Newtonsoft.Json Package

```bash
dotnet add package Newtonsoft.Json
```

### Step 3: Create a Model

Add a new file called `Person.cs`:

```csharp
namespace FileProcessor
{
    public class Person
    {
        public string Name { get; set; } = "";
        public int Age { get; set; }
        public string Email { get; set; } = "";
    }
}
```

### Step 4: Update Program.cs

Replace the content of `Program.cs` with:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.IO;
using Newtonsoft.Json;

namespace FileProcessor
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            // Create sample data
            List<Person> people = new List<Person>
            {
                new Person { Name = "Alice Smith", Age = 27, Email = "alice@example.com" },
                new Person { Name = "Bob Johnson", Age = 32, Email = "bob@example.com" },
                new Person { Name = "Carol Williams", Age = 24, Email = "carol@example.com" }
            };

            // Convert to JSON and save to file
            string json = JsonConvert.SerializeObject(people, Formatting.Indented);
            File.WriteAllText("people.json", json);
            Console.WriteLine("JSON data written to people.json");

            // Read from file and deserialize
            string readJson = File.ReadAllText("people.json");
            List<Person>? loadedPeople = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject<List<Person>>(readJson);
            Console.WriteLine("\nDeserialized data from people.json:");

            if (loadedPeople != null)
            {
                foreach (var person in loadedPeople)
                {
                    Console.WriteLine($"{person.Name}, {person.Age} years old - {person.Email}");
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Step 5: Run the Application

```bash
dotnet run
```

Output:
```
JSON data written to people.json

Deserialized data from people.json:
Alice Smith, 27 years old - alice@example.com
Bob Johnson, 32 years old - bob@example.com
Carol Williams, 24 years old - carol@example.com
```

The application:
1. Creates a list of Person objects
2. Serializes the list to JSON and saves it to a file
3. Reads the file back and deserializes the JSON into objects
4. Displays the data on the console

## Publishing .NET Applications

When your application is ready for distribution, you can create a deployable package:

### Self-contained Deployment

```bash
dotnet publish -c Release -r win-x64 --self-contained true
```

This creates a self-contained application for Windows x64 systems with all necessary dependencies.

### Framework-dependent Deployment

```bash
dotnet publish -c Release
```

This creates a framework-dependent application that requires the .NET runtime to be installed on the target system.

## Multi-Platform Support

One of the key benefits of the .NET SDK is its cross-platform capabilities:

```bash
# For Windows
dotnet publish -c Release -r win-x64

# For macOS
dotnet publish -c Release -r osx-x64

# For Linux
dotnet publish -c Release -r linux-x64
```
