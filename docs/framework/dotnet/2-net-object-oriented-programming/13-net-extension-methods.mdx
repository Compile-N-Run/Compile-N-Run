# .NET Extension Methods

## Introduction

Extension methods are a powerful feature in C# that allow you to "add" methods to existing types without modifying the original type's source code or creating derived types. Introduced in C# 3.0, extension methods provide a clean and elegant way to extend the functionality of classes, structs, interfaces, and even sealed classes that you may not have the ability to modify directly.

Extension methods are especially useful when:
- You want to extend types from libraries you don't control
- You need to add utility methods to built-in types like strings, collections, etc.
- You want to organize related functionality without inheritance

Let's dive in and learn how to create and use extension methods in C#!

## Understanding Extension Methods

### What Are Extension Methods?

Extension methods are static methods that can be called as if they were instance methods on the extended type. They're defined in static classes and use the `this` keyword before the first parameter to indicate which type they extend.

### Basic Syntax

```csharp
public static class ExtensionClassName
{
    public static ReturnType MethodName(this TypeToExtend obj, [additional parameters])
    {
        // Method implementation
    }
}
```

The `this` keyword before the first parameter is what makes this a special extension method rather than a regular static method.

## Creating Your First Extension Method

Let's start with a simple example by creating an extension method for the `string` class that counts the number of words:

```csharp
using System;

// Extension methods must be defined in a static class
public static class StringExtensions
{
    // The 'this' keyword before string indicates we're extending the string type
    public static int WordCount(this string str)
    {
        if (string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(str))
            return 0;
            
        // Split the string by whitespace and count the words
        return str.Split(new[] { ' ', '\t', '\n', '\r' }, 
            StringSplitOptions.RemoveEmptyEntries).Length;
    }
}

// Using the extension method
class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        string text = "This is an example of extension methods";
        
        // Now we can call WordCount as if it were a method on the string class
        int count = text.WordCount();
        
        Console.WriteLine($"The text contains {count} words.");
        // Output: The text contains 6 words.
    }
}
```

### How It Works

1. We create a static class `StringExtensions` to contain our extension methods
2. We define a static method `WordCount` with `this string str` as its first parameter
3. We can now call `WordCount()` on any string variable as if it were a built-in method

## Important Rules for Extension Methods

1. Extension methods must be defined in a static class
2. Extension methods must be static methods
3. The first parameter must use the `this` keyword followed by the type being extended
4. Extension methods are brought into scope through namespaces
5. Extension methods cannot access private members of the extended type

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: Extending the IEnumerable Interface

Let's create some useful extensions for the `IEnumerable<T>` interface:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;

public static class EnumerableExtensions
{
    // Check if a collection is empty
    public static bool IsEmpty<T>(this IEnumerable<T> source)
    {
        return !source.Any();
    }
    
    // Convert collection to a formatted string
    public static string ToFormattedString<T>(this IEnumerable<T> source, string separator = ", ")
    {
        if (source == null)
            return "null";
            
        return string.Join(separator, source);
    }
}

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        List<int> numbers = new List<int> { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };
        List<string> emptyList = new List<string>();
        
        Console.WriteLine($"Is numbers empty? {numbers.IsEmpty()}");
        // Output: Is numbers empty? False
        
        Console.WriteLine($"Is emptyList empty? {emptyList.IsEmpty()}");
        // Output: Is emptyList empty? True
        
        Console.WriteLine($"Numbers as string: {numbers.ToFormattedString()}");
        // Output: Numbers as string: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
        
        Console.WriteLine($"Numbers as string with custom separator: {numbers.ToFormattedString(" | ")}");
        // Output: Numbers as string with custom separator: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5
    }
}
```

### Example 2: Adding Business Logic Extensions

Imagine we have a `Customer` class that we can't modify because it's in a third-party library:

```csharp
using System;

// Pretend this is from a third-party library
public class Customer
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public DateTime DateOfBirth { get; set; }
    public string Email { get; set; }
    public decimal TotalPurchases { get; set; }
}

// Our extension methods
public static class CustomerExtensions
{
    public static int GetAge(this Customer customer)
    {
        return DateTime.Today.Year - customer.DateOfBirth.Year - 
               (customer.DateOfBirth.Date > DateTime.Today.AddYears(-DateTime.Today.Year + customer.DateOfBirth.Year) ? 1 : 0);
    }
    
    public static bool IsLoyalCustomer(this Customer customer)
    {
        return customer.TotalPurchases > 1000;
    }
    
    public static string GetCustomerSummary(this Customer customer)
    {
        string loyaltyStatus = customer.IsLoyalCustomer() ? "Loyal" : "Regular";
        return $"{customer.Name} (Age: {customer.GetAge()}), {loyaltyStatus} Customer";
    }
}

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        var customer = new Customer
        {
            Name = "John Smith",
            DateOfBirth = new DateTime(1985, 5, 15),
            Email = "john@example.com",
            TotalPurchases = 1500
        };
        
        Console.WriteLine($"Customer age: {customer.GetAge()}");
        Console.WriteLine($"Is loyal customer: {customer.IsLoyalCustomer()}");
        Console.WriteLine(customer.GetCustomerSummary());
        
        // Output (output will vary based on current date):
        // Customer age: 38
        // Is loyal customer: True
        // John Smith (Age: 38), Loyal Customer
    }
}
```

Notice how we chained the extension methods in `GetCustomerSummary()` by calling `IsLoyalCustomer()` and `GetAge()`. This demonstrates how extension methods can be composed together.

## Extension Methods vs. Other Approaches

### Extension Methods vs. Inheritance

| Extension Methods | Inheritance |
|-------------------|-------------|
| Don't modify the original type | Create a new derived type |
| Can extend sealed classes | Can't extend sealed classes |
| Can't override existing methods | Can override virtual methods |
| No access to private members | Access to protected members |
| No polymorphic behavior | Polymorphic behavior |

### Extension Methods vs. Helper Classes

| Extension Methods | Helper Classes |
|-------------------|---------------|
| Called with instance syntax: `obj.Method()` | Called with static syntax: `Helper.Method(obj)` |
| More intuitive and discoverable | Less discoverable in IntelliSense |
| Better integration with method chaining | Can be more explicit about dependencies |

## Best Practices for Extension Methods

1. **Use meaningful names**: Ensure names clearly indicate what the extension method does
2. **Place extensions in appropriate namespaces**: Group related extensions together
3. **Avoid overusing**: Don't create extension methods for everything
4. **Don't create extensions that already exist**: Check the standard libraries first
5. **Document well**: Use XML documentation comments to explain what your extension methods do
6. **Keep methods pure**: Avoid methods that have unexpected side effects
7. **Consider performance**: Be careful with extensions on frequently used types

## Common Pitfalls

### 1. Method Resolution Conflicts

Extension methods have lower precedence than instance methods. If a class has an instance method with the same name and signature as an extension method, the instance method will always be called.

```csharp
public class MyClass
{
    public void Process() 
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Instance method called");
    }
}

public static class MyExtensions
{
    public static void Process(this MyClass obj)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Extension method called");
    }
}

// Usage
var obj = new MyClass();
obj.Process(); // Always calls the instance method
```

### 2. Namespace Confusion

Extension methods are only available if their namespace is in scope. If you can't see your extension methods, check if you've included the right namespace.

```csharp
// The correct namespace needs to be imported to use the extension methods
using MyUtilities.Extensions;

public class Program 
{
    static void Main()
    {
        string text = "Hello";
        // This will only work if the namespace containing StringExtensions is imported
        int count = text.WordCount(); 
    }
}
```

## Real-World Applications

### LINQ

The most famous use of extension methods in .NET is LINQ (Language Integrated Query). All LINQ methods like `Where`, `Select`, `OrderBy`, etc., are extension methods on `IEnumerable<T>`:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        List<int> numbers = new List<int> { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 };
        
        // All of these are extension methods!
        var evenNumbers = numbers.Where(n => n % 2 == 0)
                                 .OrderByDescending(n => n)
                                 .Select(n => n * 2);
                                 
        Console.WriteLine(string.Join(", ", evenNumbers));
        // Output: 20, 16, 12, 8, 4
    }
}
```

### Fluent Interfaces

Extension methods are perfect for creating fluent interfaces that allow method chaining:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Text;

public static class StringBuilderExtensions
{
    public static StringBuilder AppendWithSeparator(this StringBuilder builder, string value, string separator)
    {
        if (builder.Length > 0)
            builder.Append(separator);
        
        return builder.Append(value);
    }
    
    public static StringBuilder AppendLineIf(this StringBuilder builder, string value, bool condition)
    {
        return condition ? builder.AppendLine(value) : builder;
    }
}

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        bool hasErrors = true;
        
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        
        // Fluent extension methods in action
        sb.Append("Starting process")
          .AppendLine()
          .AppendWithSeparator("Step 1", ": ")
          .AppendLine()
          .AppendWithSeparator("Step 2", ": ")
          .AppendLineIf("Errors found!", hasErrors)
          .Append("Process completed");
          
        Console.WriteLine(sb.ToString());
        
        // Output:
        // Starting process
        // Step 1: 
        // Step 2: 
        // Errors found!
        // Process completed
    }
}
```

## Summary

Extension methods are a powerful feature in C# that allow developers to add new functionality to existing types without modifying their source code. They provide a clean and intuitive way to extend the behavior of classes, structs, and interfaces.

Key points to remember:
- Extension methods must be defined in static classes
- They use the `this` keyword to indicate which type they extend
- They're called like instance methods but are actually static methods
- They cannot access private members of the extended type
- They have lower precedence than instance methods

By mastering extension methods, you can write more maintainable, readable, and elegant code, especially when working with types that you cannot modify directly.

## Exercises

1. Create an extension method for `int` that determines if a number is prime.
2. Create extension methods for `DateTime` that calculate age, business days between dates, and if a date is a weekend.
3. Create extension methods for `List<T>` that shuffle the elements, get a random element, and partition the list into chunks of a specified size.
4. Create a fluent API for building HTML elements using extension methods.
5. Implement your own LINQ-like extension methods such as `MyWhere` and `MySelect` to understand how LINQ works internally.
