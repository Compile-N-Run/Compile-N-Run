# .NET Static Classes

## Introduction

In .NET object-oriented programming, **static classes** are special types of classes that cannot be instantiated and are designed to serve as containers for static members only. Static classes differ from regular classes in that they act as a global access point for functionality that doesn't require object state. They're particularly useful for utility functions, constants, and other operations that don't depend on instance-specific data.

In this tutorial, we'll explore what static classes are, how they work, and when to use them in your .NET applications.

## What Are Static Classes?

A static class in .NET is a class that:

- Cannot be instantiated (you cannot use the `new` keyword to create an object of a static class)
- Cannot be used as a base class
- Cannot inherit from any class other than `Object`
- Can only contain static members (methods, fields, properties, events)
- Cannot contain instance constructors (but can have static constructors)

Static classes are marked with the `static` keyword in C#:

```csharp
public static class MathHelper
{
    // Static members go here
}
```

## When to Use Static Classes

Static classes are ideal for:

1. **Utility functions**: Operations that don't require state
2. **Helper methods**: Common functionality shared across your application
3. **Extension methods**: Methods that extend existing types
4. **Constants and configuration values**: Application-wide settings
5. **Factory methods**: Methods that create and return objects

## Static Class Examples

### Basic Static Class

Let's look at a simple static utility class:

```csharp
public static class StringHelper
{
    public static bool IsNullOrEmpty(string text)
    {
        return string.IsNullOrEmpty(text);
    }
    
    public static string Reverse(string text)
    {
        if (text == null) return null;
        
        char[] chars = text.ToCharArray();
        Array.Reverse(chars);
        return new string(chars);
    }
    
    public static int CountWords(string text)
    {
        if (string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(text)) return 0;
        
        return text.Split(new[] { ' ', '\t', '\n' }, 
            StringSplitOptions.RemoveEmptyEntries).Length;
    }
}
```

### Using a Static Class

Here's how you would use the `StringHelper` class:

```csharp
// No need to create an instance
string sample = "Hello, world!";

// Call static methods directly through the class name
bool isEmpty = StringHelper.IsNullOrEmpty(sample);
string reversed = StringHelper.Reverse(sample);
int wordCount = StringHelper.CountWords(sample);

Console.WriteLine($"Is Empty: {isEmpty}");
Console.WriteLine($"Reversed: {reversed}");
Console.WriteLine($"Word Count: {wordCount}");
```

**Output:**
```
Is Empty: False
Reversed: !dlrow ,olleH
Word Count: 2
```

## Static Class vs. Regular Class with Static Members

You might wonder when to use a static class versus a regular class with static members. Here's a comparison:

**Static Class:**
```csharp
public static class Calculator
{
    public static double Add(double a, double b) => a + b;
    public static double Subtract(double a, double b) => a - b;
}
```

**Regular Class with Static Members:**
```csharp
public class Calculator
{
    // Static members
    public static double Add(double a, double b) => a + b;
    public static double Subtract(double a, double b) => a - b;
    
    // Instance members
    public double Memory { get; private set; }
    
    public void Store(double value)
    {
        Memory = value;
    }
    
    public double RecallMemory()
    {
        return Memory;
    }
}
```

### When to choose which:

- Use a **static class** when ALL functionality is stateless and applies globally
- Use a **regular class with static members** when you need both static and instance behavior

## Common .NET Framework Static Classes

The .NET Framework includes many static classes you've likely already used:

- `Console`: For console input/output operations
- `Math`: For mathematical functions
- `File` and `Directory`: For file system operations
- `Convert`: For type conversion utilities
- `String`: For string manipulation (note: `string` is a keyword for `System.String`)

## Static Class Best Practices

1. **Name them appropriately**: Use names that reflect their purpose (e.g., `StringHelper`, `MathUtilities`)
2. **Group related functionality**: Keep methods logically related within a class
3. **Avoid state**: Static classes shouldn't maintain state as they're shared across the application
4. **Keep methods pure**: Functions should ideally be deterministic and have no side effects
5. **Consider thread safety**: Remember that static members are shared across threads

## Real-World Application: Logger Utility

Here's a practical example of a simple logging utility implemented as a static class:

```csharp
public static class Logger
{
    private static readonly string LogFilePath = "application.log";
    
    static Logger()
    {
        // Initialize the log file
        File.WriteAllText(LogFilePath, $"Log started at {DateTime.Now}\n");
    }
    
    public static void Info(string message)
    {
        WriteToLog("INFO", message);
    }
    
    public static void Warning(string message)
    {
        WriteToLog("WARNING", message);
    }
    
    public static void Error(string message)
    {
        WriteToLog("ERROR", message);
    }
    
    public static void Error(Exception ex)
    {
        WriteToLog("ERROR", $"{ex.Message}\n{ex.StackTrace}");
    }
    
    private static void WriteToLog(string level, string message)
    {
        string logEntry = $"[{DateTime.Now:yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss}] [{level}] {message}\n";
        
        // In a real application, use file locking or a better logging solution
        File.AppendAllText(LogFilePath, logEntry);
    }
}
```

You can use this logger throughout your application:

```csharp
public class UserService
{
    public void CreateUser(string username)
    {
        try
        {
            Logger.Info($"Creating user: {username}");
            // Code to create user
            Logger.Info($"User created successfully: {username}");
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            Logger.Error(ex);
            throw;
        }
    }
}
```

## Common Pitfalls with Static Classes

1. **Testing difficulties**: Static classes can be harder to mock in unit tests
2. **Hidden dependencies**: Methods using static classes have implicit dependencies
3. **Tight coupling**: Code becomes tightly coupled to the static implementation
4. **Concurrency issues**: State in static classes is shared across all threads
5. **Initialization order**: Static constructors run at unpredictable times

## Extension Methods and Static Classes

Extension methods must be defined in static classes. These methods "extend" existing types without modifying them:

```csharp
public static class StringExtensions
{
    public static bool IsValidEmail(this string email)
    {
        if (string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(email))
            return false;
            
        // Simple validation: contains @ and at least one dot after @
        int atIndex = email.IndexOf('@');
        if (atIndex < 1) 
            return false;
            
        int dotIndex = email.IndexOf('.', atIndex);
        return dotIndex > atIndex && dotIndex < email.Length - 1;
    }
}
```

You can then use this extension method as if it were part of the `string` class:

```csharp
string email = "user@example.com";
bool isValid = email.IsValidEmail(); // true

string invalidEmail = "not-an-email";
bool isInvalid = invalidEmail.IsValidEmail(); // false
```

## Summary

Static classes in .NET provide a convenient way to organize functionality that doesn't require object instances. They serve as containers for utility methods, constants, and other shared functionality that applies globally within your application.

Key takeaways:
- Static classes cannot be instantiated
- They can only contain static members
- They're ideal for utility functions and helpers
- Common examples include math utilities, string helpers, and logging services
- Extension methods must be defined in static classes
- Be aware of potential pitfalls like testing challenges and tight coupling

While static classes offer convenience, use them judiciously. For complex systems, consider dependency injection and interfaces for better testability and looser coupling.

## Exercises

1. Create a static `FileHelper` class with methods to:
   - Count lines in a text file
   - Extract file extension from a path
   - Convert file size bytes to human-readable format (KB, MB, etc.)

2. Build a static `ValidationHelper` class with methods to validate:
   - Phone numbers
   - Postal/ZIP codes
   - Credit card numbers (simple validation)

3. Design a static `DateTimeHelper` class with methods to:
   - Get current age from birthdate
   - Format a date as a relative time (e.g., "2 days ago")
   - Determine if a date is a weekend or weekday
