# .NET Async Methods

In modern application development, responsiveness is critical. Users expect applications to remain interactive even when performing time-consuming operations like network requests, file I/O, or database queries. .NET's asynchronous programming model provides powerful tools to achieve this through async methods.

## Understanding Async Methods

Async methods allow code execution to continue without waiting for long-running operations to complete. When an async operation is started, the method returns control to the caller while the operation executes in the background. Once the operation completes, execution can resume where it left off.

### Key Components of Async Methods

- The `async` keyword marks a method as asynchronous
- The `await` keyword pauses execution until an awaited task completes
- `Task` and `Task<T>` represent asynchronous operations

## Creating Your First Async Method

Let's look at the basic structure of an async method:

```csharp
public async Task<string> GetWebContentAsync(string url)
{
    HttpClient client = new HttpClient();
    
    // The await keyword pauses execution until the task completes
    string content = await client.GetStringAsync(url);
    
    return content;
}
```

This simple method downloads content from a URL asynchronously. The `async` keyword tells the compiler this method contains asynchronous operations, and the `Task<string>` return type indicates it will eventually produce a string value.

## Using Async Methods

To use an async method, you typically await its result:

```csharp
public async Task DisplayWebPageContentAsync()
{
    try
    {
        string content = await GetWebContentAsync("https://example.com");
        Console.WriteLine($"Downloaded {content.Length} characters");
    }
    catch (Exception ex)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Download failed: {ex.Message}");
    }
}
```

### Main Method and Async

For console applications, you can make your `Main` method async starting from C# 7.1:

```csharp
static async Task Main(string[] args)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Starting download...");
    await DisplayWebPageContentAsync();
    Console.WriteLine("Download complete!");
}
```

## Return Types for Async Methods

Async methods can use several return types:

1. `Task` - For methods that perform an operation but don't return a value
2. `Task<T>` - For methods that return a value of type T
3. `void` - For event handlers (generally not recommended otherwise)
4. `ValueTask` / `ValueTask<T>` - For high-performance scenarios where allocating a Task might be avoided

### Example of Different Return Types

```csharp
// Returns a Task (no data)
public async Task SaveLogAsync(string message)
{
    using (StreamWriter writer = new StreamWriter("log.txt", true))
    {
        await writer.WriteLineAsync(message);
    }
}

// Returns a Task<int>
public async Task<int> CountWordsInFileAsync(string path)
{
    string text = await File.ReadAllTextAsync(path);
    return text.Split(new[] { ' ', '\n', '\r', '\t' }, 
        StringSplitOptions.RemoveEmptyEntries).Length;
}
```

## Async Method Best Practices

### 1. Use Async All the Way

Avoid mixing synchronous and asynchronous code. If a method calls async methods, it should generally be async itself.

❌ Bad practice:
```csharp
public string GetWebContent(string url)
{
    // Blocking call that waits for the async operation
    return GetWebContentAsync(url).Result;
}
```

✅ Good practice:
```csharp
public async Task<string> GetWebContentAsync(string url)
{
    return await GetWebContentAsync(url);
}
```

### 2. Use ConfigureAwait When Appropriate

In library code, consider using `ConfigureAwait(false)` to prevent potential deadlocks:

```csharp
public async Task<string> GetWebContentAsync(string url)
{
    HttpClient client = new HttpClient();
    return await client.GetStringAsync(url).ConfigureAwait(false);
}
```

### 3. Follow Naming Conventions

By convention, append "Async" to method names that return Task or `Task<T>`:

```csharp
public async Task<User> GetUserAsync(int userId)
{
    // Implementation
}
```

## Real-World Example: Asynchronous File Processing

Let's build a simple file processing utility that reads multiple files asynchronously and processes their content:

```csharp
public class FileProcessor
{
    public async Task<Dictionary<string, int>> CountWordsInMultipleFilesAsync(
        string[] filePaths)
    {
        Dictionary<string, int> results = new Dictionary<string, int>();
        
        // Create a list of tasks
        List<Task<(string path, int count)>> tasks = new List<Task<(string, int)>>();
        
        // Start all tasks
        foreach (string path in filePaths)
        {
            tasks.Add(ProcessFileAsync(path));
        }
        
        // Wait for all tasks to complete and collect results
        var completedTasks = await Task.WhenAll(tasks);
        
        // Process results
        foreach (var result in completedTasks)
        {
            results[result.path] = result.count;
        }
        
        return results;
    }
    
    private async Task<(string path, int count)> ProcessFileAsync(string filePath)
    {
        string content = await File.ReadAllTextAsync(filePath);
        int wordCount = content.Split(new[] { ' ', '\n', '\r', '\t' }, 
            StringSplitOptions.RemoveEmptyEntries).Length;
        
        return (filePath, wordCount);
    }
}
```

### How to Use This in a Console Application:

```csharp
static async Task Main(string[] args)
{
    string[] files = new[] 
    { 
        "file1.txt", 
        "file2.txt", 
        "file3.txt" 
    };
    
    FileProcessor processor = new FileProcessor();
    
    Console.WriteLine("Starting file processing...");
    var results = await processor.CountWordsInMultipleFilesAsync(files);
    
    foreach (var result in results)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"{result.Key}: {result.Value} words");
    }
}
```

## Exception Handling in Async Methods

Exception handling in async methods works similarly to synchronous code:

```csharp
public async Task<string> ReadFileWithRetryAsync(string path, int maxRetries = 3)
{
    int attempts = 0;
    
    while (true)
    {
        try
        {
            attempts++;
            return await File.ReadAllTextAsync(path);
        }
        catch (IOException ex) when (attempts < maxRetries)
        {
            // Log the error
            Console.WriteLine($"Attempt {attempts} failed: {ex.Message}");
            
            // Wait before retrying
            await Task.Delay(1000 * attempts);
        }
    }
}
```

## Cancellation Support

Async methods should support cancellation when appropriate:

```csharp
public async Task<string> DownloadWithTimeoutAsync(
    string url, 
    CancellationToken cancellationToken = default)
{
    using HttpClient client = new HttpClient();
    
    // This will throw OperationCanceledException if cancellation is requested
    string result = await client.GetStringAsync(url, cancellationToken);
    
    return result;
}

// Usage:
public async Task Demo()
{
    var cts = new CancellationTokenSource(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(5));
    
    try
    {
        string content = await DownloadWithTimeoutAsync(
            "https://example.com", 
            cts.Token);
        
        Console.WriteLine("Download completed successfully");
    }
    catch (OperationCanceledException)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Download timed out or was cancelled");
    }
}
```

## Parallel Operations with Task

For running multiple operations in parallel:

```csharp
public async Task<IEnumerable<WeatherData>> GetWeatherForMultipleCitiesAsync(
    string[] cityNames)
{
    List<Task<WeatherData>> tasks = new List<Task<WeatherData>>();
    
    foreach (var city in cityNames)
    {
        // Start all requests in parallel
        tasks.Add(GetWeatherForCityAsync(city));
    }
    
    // Wait for all to complete
    return await Task.WhenAll(tasks);
}

private async Task<WeatherData> GetWeatherForCityAsync(string cityName)
{
    // Simulate API call
    await Task.Delay(1000);
    
    return new WeatherData
    {
        CityName = cityName,
        Temperature = new Random().Next(0, 35),
        Condition = "Sunny"
    };
}

public class WeatherData
{
    public string CityName { get; set; }
    public int Temperature { get; set; }
    public string Condition { get; set; }
}
```

## Summary

Async methods are a powerful feature in .NET that enable you to write responsive and efficient applications. By using the `async` and `await` keywords, you can perform time-consuming operations without blocking the main thread, leading to better user experience and resource utilization.

Key points to remember:
- Use `async` and `await` for I/O-bound operations (file, network, database)
- Follow the "async all the way" principle
- Use proper return types (`Task`, `Task<T>`)
- Handle exceptions appropriately
- Support cancellation when needed
