# .NET Value Types

## Introduction

In the .NET framework, data types are divided into two main categories: **Value Types** and **Reference Types**. Understanding the difference between these two is fundamental to becoming proficient in C# and .NET programming.

Value types directly contain their data, and when you create a variable of a value type, a single space in memory is allocated to store the value. When you assign a value-type variable to another variable, a copy of the value is created.

## What Are Value Types?

Value types in .NET have several distinctive characteristics:

1. **Direct Storage**: Store their values directly in memory where the variable is declared
2. **Stack Allocation**: Usually allocated on the stack (a fast-access memory region)
3. **Copy Behavior**: When assigned to another variable, the entire value is copied
4. **Immediate Cleanup**: No garbage collection needed; memory is reclaimed when they go out of scope

## Common Value Types in .NET

The .NET framework provides several built-in value types that you'll use frequently:

### Numeric Types

These represent various sizes and types of numbers:

```csharp
// Integer types
byte byteValue = 255;         // 8-bit unsigned integer (0 to 255)
sbyte sbyteValue = -128;      // 8-bit signed integer (-128 to 127)
short shortValue = 32000;     // 16-bit signed integer
ushort ushortValue = 65000;   // 16-bit unsigned integer
int intValue = 2147483647;    // 32-bit signed integer
uint uintValue = 4294967295;  // 32-bit unsigned integer
long longValue = 9223372036854775807;       // 64-bit signed integer
ulong ulongValue = 18446744073709551615;    // 64-bit unsigned integer

// Floating-point types
float floatValue = 3.14f;     // 32-bit floating point (note the 'f' suffix)
double doubleValue = 3.14159; // 64-bit floating point
decimal decimalValue = 3.14159265358979m; // 128-bit high-precision decimal (note the 'm' suffix)
```

### Boolean Type

Represents a true/false value:

```csharp
bool isComplete = true;
bool hasErrors = false;
```

### Character Type

Represents a Unicode character:

```csharp
char letter = 'A';
char symbol = '$';
char unicodeChar = '\u03A9'; // Greek uppercase omega character: Î©
```

## Structs - Custom Value Types

In C#, you can create your own value types using structs:

```csharp
public struct Point
{
    public int X { get; set; }
    public int Y { get; set; }
    
    public Point(int x, int y)
    {
        X = x;
        Y = y;
    }
    
    public double DistanceFromOrigin()
    {
        return Math.Sqrt(X * X + Y * Y);
    }
}

// Usage
Point p1 = new Point(3, 4);
Console.WriteLine($"Distance from origin: {p1.DistanceFromOrigin()}");
// Output: Distance from origin: 5
```

## Enumerations

Enumerations are value types that define a set of named constants:

```csharp
public enum DayOfWeek
{
    Sunday = 0,
    Monday = 1,
    Tuesday = 2,
    Wednesday = 3,
    Thursday = 4,
    Friday = 5,
    Saturday = 6
}

// Usage
DayOfWeek today = DayOfWeek.Wednesday;
Console.WriteLine($"Today is {today}");
// Output: Today is Wednesday

Console.WriteLine($"Day number: {(int)today}");
// Output: Day number: 3
```

## Value Type vs. Reference Type Behavior

Let's examine how value types behave differently from reference types:

```csharp
// Value type example
int a = 10;
int b = a; // A copy of 'a' is created
b = 20;    // Only 'b' changes

Console.WriteLine($"a = {a}, b = {b}");
// Output: a = 10, b = 20

// Reference type example (for comparison)
int[] arrayA = { 1, 2, 3 };
int[] arrayB = arrayA; // Both variables reference the same array
arrayB[0] = 99;        // Both arrays are affected

Console.WriteLine($"arrayA[0] = {arrayA[0]}, arrayB[0] = {arrayB[0]}");
// Output: arrayA[0] = 99, arrayB[0] = 99
```

## Value Types and Memory

Value types are typically allocated on the stack, which provides faster allocation and deallocation compared to the heap (where reference types are stored):

```csharp
void ProcessData()
{
    // These value types are allocated on the stack
    int id = 1001;
    bool isValid = true;
    double amount = 150.75;
    
    // When this method exits, the stack-allocated memory is automatically reclaimed
}
```

## Nullable Value Types

By default, value types cannot be `null`, but .NET provides nullable value types:

```csharp
// Regular value type - cannot be null
int regularInt = 5;
// regularInt = null; // This would cause a compile error

// Nullable value type - can be null
int? nullableInt = 5;
nullableInt = null; // This is allowed

// Working with nullable types
if (nullableInt.HasValue)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Value: {nullableInt.Value}");
}
else
{
    Console.WriteLine("The value is null");
}

// Null coalescing operator
int result = nullableInt ?? 0; // If nullableInt is null, use 0
```

## Real-World Applications

### Example 1: Coordinate System in a Game

```csharp
public struct Coordinate
{
    public float X { get; set; }
    public float Y { get; set; }
    public float Z { get; set; }
    
    public Coordinate(float x, float y, float z)
    {
        X = x;
        Y = y;
        Z = z;
    }
    
    public float DistanceTo(Coordinate other)
    {
        float dx = X - other.X;
        float dy = Y - other.Y;
        float dz = Z - other.Z;
        return (float)Math.Sqrt(dx * dx + dy * dy + dz * dz);
    }
}

// Game usage example
Coordinate playerPosition = new Coordinate(10, 0, 5);
Coordinate enemyPosition = new Coordinate(15, 0, 7);

float distance = playerPosition.DistanceTo(enemyPosition);
Console.WriteLine($"Distance to enemy: {distance:F2} units");
// Output: Distance to enemy: 5.39 units
```

### Example 2: Money Calculation

```csharp
public struct Money
{
    public decimal Amount { get; }
    public string Currency { get; }
    
    public Money(decimal amount, string currency)
    {
        Amount = amount;
        Currency = currency;
    }
    
    public override string ToString()
    {
        return $"{Amount:N2} {Currency}";
    }
    
    // Money operations
    public static Money Add(Money a, Money b)
    {
        if (a.Currency != b.Currency)
            throw new InvalidOperationException("Cannot add different currencies");
            
        return new Money(a.Amount + b.Amount, a.Currency);
    }
}

// Usage in financial app
Money salary = new Money(5000.00m, "USD");
Money bonus = new Money(1000.00m, "USD");
Money total = Money.Add(salary, bonus);

Console.WriteLine($"Salary: {salary}");
Console.WriteLine($"Bonus: {bonus}");
Console.WriteLine($"Total: {total}");

/* Output:
Salary: 5,000.00 USD
Bonus: 1,000.00 USD
Total: 6,000.00 USD
*/
```

## Best Practices for Value Types

1. **Keep them small**: Value types should generally be small since they are copied when passed around.
2. **Make them immutable**: When possible, design structs as immutable (define properties with private setters and set values only in constructors).
3. **Avoid excessive boxing/unboxing**: Boxing (converting value types to reference types) can hurt performance.
4. **Implement value equality properly**: Override `Equals()` and `GetHashCode()` for custom value types.
5. **Use structs for small, data-focused types**: If a type primarily stores data and is less than 16 bytes, consider a struct.

## Common Pitfalls

### Boxing and Unboxing

When value types are converted to `object` type (or interfaces), they are "boxed" into a reference type, which can impact performance:

```csharp
int number = 42;
object boxed = number;  // Boxing occurs (value type to reference type)
int unboxed = (int)boxed; // Unboxing occurs (reference type back to value type)
```

### Default Constructor Behavior

Structs always have an implicit default constructor that sets all fields to their default values:

```csharp
struct Point3D
{
    public int X, Y, Z;
    
    public Point3D(int x, int y, int z)
    {
        X = x;
        Y = y;
        Z = z;
    }
}

// Both are valid
Point3D p1 = new Point3D(1, 2, 3);
Point3D p2 = new Point3D(); // Creates point with X=0, Y=0, Z=0
```

## Summary

Value types in .NET are fundamental building blocks that store data directly in memory. They offer efficiency for small data structures and simple types because they avoid the overhead of heap allocation and garbage collection.

Key points to remember:
- Value types directly contain data and are copied when assigned
- They include primitives (int, float, bool), structs, and enums
- They're typically allocated on the stack for better performance
- Value types cannot be null by default (unless used with the nullable syntax)
- Structs allow you to create custom value types

Understanding value types and when to use them is crucial for writing efficient and correct .NET applications.

## Exercises

1. Create a `Temperature` struct that can convert between Celsius and Fahrenheit.
2. Implement a `TimeSpan` struct that represents hours, minutes, and seconds with appropriate methods.
3. Write a program that demonstrates the difference between passing a value type and a reference type to a method.
4. Create a `Complex` struct for complex numbers with addition and multiplication operations.
5. Write code that demonstrates the performance difference between using many small objects as structs versus classes.
