# .NET Exception Propagation

Imagine you're playing a game of hot potato, but instead of a potato, you're passing an error. That's essentially how exception propagation works in .NET applications! Understanding this mechanism is crucial for writing robust code that gracefully handles errors.

## What is Exception Propagation?

Exception propagation is the process by which an exception travels up the call stack when it's thrown but not caught at the point of origin. When an exception occurs in a method, if that method doesn't handle the exception, .NET automatically passes it up to the calling method. This process continues until either:

1. The exception is caught and handled by an appropriate `catch` block
2. The exception reaches the top of the call stack, causing the application to terminate

## The Call Stack and Exception Flow

Before diving deeper, let's understand what the call stack is:

The call stack is a data structure that tracks the sequence of method calls in your application. When you call a method, it's added (pushed) to the top of the stack. When the method completes, it's removed (popped) from the stack.

Here's how exceptions move through this stack:

```
Main() → MethodA() → MethodB() → MethodC() [Exception occurs!]
```

If `MethodC()` throws an exception and doesn't catch it, the exception propagates to `MethodB()`. If `MethodB()` doesn't catch it either, it continues to `MethodA()`, and so on.

## Basic Exception Propagation Example

Let's see a simple example of how exceptions propagate:

```csharp
using System;

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        try
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Starting the program...");
            MethodA();
            Console.WriteLine("This line won't execute if an exception occurs.");
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Exception caught in Main: {ex.Message}");
            Console.WriteLine($"Stack trace: {ex.StackTrace}");
        }
        Console.WriteLine("Program continues after exception handling.");
    }

    static void MethodA()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Entering MethodA");
        MethodB();
        Console.WriteLine("Exiting MethodA"); // This won't execute if MethodB throws an exception
    }

    static void MethodB()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Entering MethodB");
        MethodC();
        Console.WriteLine("Exiting MethodB"); // This won't execute if MethodC throws an exception
    }

    static void MethodC()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Entering MethodC");
        throw new InvalidOperationException("Something went wrong in MethodC!");
        Console.WriteLine("Exiting MethodC"); // This will never execute
    }
}
```

Output:
```
Starting the program...
Entering MethodA
Entering MethodB
Entering MethodC
Exception caught in Main: Something went wrong in MethodC!
Stack trace:   at Program.MethodC() in Program.cs:line 35
   at Program.MethodB() in Program.cs:line 28
   at Program.MethodA() in Program.cs:line 21
   at Program.Main(String[] args) in Program.cs:line 10
Program continues after exception handling.
```

Notice how:
1. The exception originates in `MethodC()`
2. It propagates through `MethodB()` and `MethodA()`
3. Finally, it's caught in the `Main()` method's `try-catch` block
4. The stack trace shows us the exact path of propagation

## Stopping Propagation with try-catch

You can stop exception propagation at any level by catching the exception:

```csharp
static void MethodB()
{
    Console.WriteLine("Entering MethodB");
    try
    {
        MethodC();
    }
    catch (InvalidOperationException ex)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Exception caught in MethodB: {ex.Message}");
        // Exception stops here and doesn't propagate to MethodA
    }
    Console.WriteLine("Exiting MethodB"); // This will execute now
}
```

Output:
```
Starting the program...
Entering MethodA
Entering MethodB
Entering MethodC
Exception caught in MethodB: Something went wrong in MethodC!
Exiting MethodB
Exiting MethodA
This line won't execute if an exception occurs.
```

## Re-throwing Exceptions

Sometimes you want to catch an exception, perform some action, but still let it propagate up the stack. You can do this by re-throwing:

### Simple Re-throw

```csharp
static void MethodB()
{
    Console.WriteLine("Entering MethodB");
    try
    {
        MethodC();
    }
    catch (InvalidOperationException ex)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Logging error in MethodB: {ex.Message}");
        throw; // Re-throws the SAME exception, preserving stack trace
    }
    Console.WriteLine("Exiting MethodB");
}
```

### Throw New Exception

```csharp
static void MethodB()
{
    Console.WriteLine("Entering MethodB");
    try
    {
        MethodC();
    }
    catch (InvalidOperationException ex)
    {
        // Wrap the original exception with additional information
        throw new ApplicationException("Error in application flow", ex);
    }
    Console.WriteLine("Exiting MethodB");
}
```

## Practical Example: File Processing with Exception Propagation

Let's see a real-world example involving file processing:

```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;

class FileProcessor
{
    public static void ProcessUserFiles(string directoryPath)
    {
        try
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Processing files in: {directoryPath}");
            ValidateDirectory(directoryPath);
            ProcessDirectory(directoryPath);
            Console.WriteLine("All files processed successfully!");
        }
        catch (DirectoryNotFoundException ex)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Error: Directory not found. {ex.Message}");
        }
        catch (UnauthorizedAccessException ex)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Error: Access denied. {ex.Message}");
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Unexpected error: {ex.Message}");
            Console.WriteLine($"Stack trace: {ex.StackTrace}");
            // In a real application, you might log this error
            throw; // Re-throw for the calling code to handle
        }
    }

    private static void ValidateDirectory(string path)
    {
        if (!Directory.Exists(path))
        {
            throw new DirectoryNotFoundException($"The directory '{path}' does not exist.");
        }

        // Check if we have access permissions
        try
        {
            Directory.GetFiles(path);
        }
        catch (UnauthorizedAccessException)
        {
            throw new UnauthorizedAccessException($"Cannot access directory '{path}'. Check permissions.");
        }
    }

    private static void ProcessDirectory(string path)
    {
        string[] files = Directory.GetFiles(path, "*.txt");
        
        if (files.Length == 0)
        {
            throw new FileNotFoundException("No text files found to process.");
        }
        
        foreach (string file in files)
        {
            ProcessFile(file);
        }
    }

    private static void ProcessFile(string filePath)
    {
        try
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Processing file: {Path.GetFileName(filePath)}");
            string content = File.ReadAllText(filePath);
            
            if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(content))
            {
                throw new InvalidDataException($"File {Path.GetFileName(filePath)} is empty.");
            }
            
            // Process content...
            Console.WriteLine($"Successfully processed {Path.GetFileName(filePath)}");
        }
        catch (IOException ex)
        {
            // Log the exception details but let it propagate
            Console.WriteLine($"IO error with file {Path.GetFileName(filePath)}: {ex.Message}");
            throw;
        }
    }
}
```

Here's how you might use this class:

```csharp
static void Main(string[] args)
{
    try
    {
        FileProcessor.ProcessUserFiles(@"C:\Documents\UserData");
    }
    catch (Exception ex)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Fatal error in file processing:");
        Console.WriteLine(ex.Message);
        
        if (ex.InnerException != null)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Caused by: {ex.InnerException.Message}");
        }
    }
}
```

## Exception Propagation Across Boundaries

Exception propagation works differently across certain boundaries:

### Across Thread Boundaries

Exceptions don't automatically propagate across threads. If an exception occurs in a thread, it will crash that thread but not automatically affect others:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Threading;

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        Thread thread = new Thread(() => {
            throw new InvalidOperationException("Error in thread!");
        });
        
        thread.Start();
        thread.Join(); // Wait for thread to complete
        
        Console.WriteLine("Main thread continues execution");
        // Main thread continues despite exception in other thread
    }
}
```

### Async/Await Exception Propagation

With async/await, exceptions are automatically marshalled back to the calling context:

```csharp
static async Task Main(string[] args)
{
    try
    {
        await RunAsync();
    }
    catch (Exception ex)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Exception caught: {ex.Message}");
    }
}

static async Task RunAsync()
{
    await Task.Delay(1000); // Simulate async work
    throw new InvalidOperationException("Async exception");
}
```

## Best Practices for Exception Propagation

1. **Catch Specific Exceptions**: Always catch the most specific exception types first.
   
2. **Don't Swallow Exceptions**: Avoid empty catch blocks that hide errors.
   
   ```csharp
   // Bad practice
   try {
       RiskyOperation();
   }
   catch (Exception) { } // Swallowing the exception
   ```

3. **Preserve Stack Trace**: Use `throw;` instead of `throw ex;` to preserve the original stack trace.
   
   ```csharp
   try {
       RiskyOperation();
   }
   catch (Exception ex) {
       LogError(ex);
       throw; // Preserves stack trace
       // throw ex; <- This would reset the stack trace
   }
   ```

4. **Log Before Re-throwing**: Log exception details before re-throwing to aid debugging.
   
5. **Add Context**: When re-throwing as a new exception, include the original as an inner exception.
   
   ```csharp
   try {
       ProcessData();
   }
   catch (Exception ex) {
       throw new ApplicationException("Failed during data processing", ex);
   }
   ```

6. **Consider Custom Exceptions**: Create custom exceptions for your application's specific error conditions.

## Summary

Exception propagation in .NET is an essential concept that lets errors bubble up through your application's call stack until they're handled appropriately. By understanding how exceptions propagate, you can create more resilient applications that handle errors gracefully at the right level of abstraction.

Remember these key points:
- Unhandled exceptions automatically propagate up the call stack
- You can catch exceptions at any level to stop propagation
- Use `throw;` to re-throw the same exception while preserving the stack trace
- Exceptions don't automatically cross thread boundaries
- Async/await automatically preserves exception propagation

## Exercises

1. Create a simple calculator application with methods for addition, subtraction, division, and multiplication. Implement appropriate exception handling and propagation for scenarios like division by zero.

2. Build a file parsing application that reads configuration from nested JSON files. Implement exception propagation that provides meaningful error messages about which file and what line caused problems.

3. Implement a chain of responsibility pattern where different handlers process data sequentially. Use exception propagation to signal when a handler can't process the data.
