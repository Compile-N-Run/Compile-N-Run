# .NET Try Catch

Exception handling is a critical part of writing robust applications. In .NET, the primary mechanism for handling exceptions is the try-catch block. This article will guide you through understanding and effectively using try-catch blocks to handle exceptions in your .NET applications.

## Introduction to Try-Catch

When your code encounters an unexpected condition that it can't handle during execution, .NET throws an exception. If these exceptions aren't handled properly, they can cause your application to crash. Try-catch blocks provide a structured way to:

1. **Attempt** potentially problematic code (in the `try` block)
2. **Catch** any exceptions that occur (in one or more `catch` blocks)
3. **Clean up** resources regardless of whether an exception occurred (in the `finally` block)

## Basic Syntax

Here's the basic syntax of a try-catch block in C#:

```csharp
try
{
    // Code that might cause an exception
}
catch (ExceptionType ex)
{
    // Code to handle the exception
}
finally
{
    // Code that always runs, whether an exception occurred or not
}
```

The `finally` block is optional but extremely useful for cleanup operations.

## Simple Try-Catch Example

Let's start with a simple example of using try-catch to handle a division by zero exception:

```csharp
try
{
    Console.Write("Enter a number: ");
    int numerator = int.Parse(Console.ReadLine());
    
    Console.Write("Enter another number: ");
    int denominator = int.Parse(Console.ReadLine());
    
    int result = numerator / denominator;
    Console.WriteLine($"Result: {result}");
}
catch (DivideByZeroException ex)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Error: Cannot divide by zero!");
    Console.WriteLine($"Exception Details: {ex.Message}");
}
catch (FormatException ex)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Error: Please enter valid numbers!");
    Console.WriteLine($"Exception Details: {ex.Message}");
}
catch (Exception ex)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"An unexpected error occurred: {ex.Message}");
}
finally
{
    Console.WriteLine("Calculation operation completed.");
}
```

### Example Input/Output:

**Input 1:**
```
Enter a number: 10
Enter another number: 0
```

**Output 1:**
```
Error: Cannot divide by zero!
Exception Details: Attempted to divide by zero.
Calculation operation completed.
```

**Input 2:**
```
Enter a number: abc
```

**Output 2:**
```
Error: Please enter valid numbers!
Exception Details: Input string was not in a correct format.
Calculation operation completed.
```

## Exception Hierarchy and Catch Block Order

In .NET, all exceptions derive from the base `System.Exception` class. When you have multiple catch blocks, they are evaluated in order from most specific to most general. This is why it's important to place more specific exception types first.

```csharp
try
{
    // Code that might throw exceptions
}
catch (ArgumentNullException ex)
{
    // Most specific exception
}
catch (ArgumentException ex)
{
    // Less specific exception
}
catch (Exception ex)
{
    // Most general exception - catches anything not caught above
}
```

If you place a more general exception type before a more specific one, the compiler will generate an error because the more specific catch block would be unreachable.

## Using Exception Properties

Exception objects contain useful properties that can help with debugging and handling:

- `Message`: A human-readable description of the error
- `StackTrace`: Shows the call stack at the point the exception was thrown
- `InnerException`: The exception that caused the current exception (if applicable)
- `Source`: Name of the application or object that caused the error

Here's how to use these properties:

```csharp
try
{
    string[] names = { "John", "Mary", "Bob" };
    Console.WriteLine(names[5]); // Accessing index out of range
}
catch (IndexOutOfRangeException ex)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Error Message: {ex.Message}");
    Console.WriteLine($"Stack Trace: {ex.StackTrace}");
    Console.WriteLine($"Source: {ex.Source}");
}
```

**Output:**
```
Error Message: Index was outside the bounds of the array.
Stack Trace:   at Program.<Main>$(String[] args) in C:\example\Program.cs:line 6
Source: Program
```

## When to Use Try-Catch

You should use try-catch blocks in the following scenarios:

1. When working with external resources (files, databases, network)
2. When parsing user input
3. When calling methods that might throw exceptions
4. When implementing retry logic
5. At application boundaries to prevent exceptions from crashing the application

However, don't use exceptions for normal control flow. It's inefficient and makes code harder to understand.

## Real-World Example: File Processing

Here's a practical example of using try-catch for file operations:

```csharp
public static string ReadTextFile(string filePath)
{
    string content = string.Empty;
    StreamReader reader = null;
    
    try
    {
        reader = new StreamReader(filePath);
        content = reader.ReadToEnd();
        return content;
    }
    catch (FileNotFoundException ex)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"The file '{filePath}' was not found.");
        Console.WriteLine($"Error details: {ex.Message}");
        // You might log this exception or take alternative actions
        return string.Empty;
    }
    catch (IOException ex)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Error reading the file: {ex.Message}");
        return string.Empty;
    }
    catch (Exception ex)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Unexpected error: {ex.Message}");
        return string.Empty;
    }
    finally
    {
        // This ensures the file is closed even if an exception occurs
        if (reader != null)
        {
            reader.Close();
        }
    }
}
```

## Using Multiple Catch Blocks for Different Exception Types

Different exceptions might require different handling strategies. Here's an example of a web service call with multiple catch blocks:

```csharp
public async Task<User> GetUserByIdAsync(int userId)
{
    try
    {
        HttpClient client = new HttpClient();
        var response = await client.GetAsync($"https://api.example.com/users/{userId}");
        response.EnsureSuccessStatusCode();
        
        string responseBody = await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();
        return JsonSerializer.Deserialize<User>(responseBody);
    }
    catch (HttpRequestException ex) when (ex.StatusCode == HttpStatusCode.NotFound)
    {
        // Handle 404 Not Found specifically
        Console.WriteLine($"User with ID {userId} was not found.");
        return null;
    }
    catch (HttpRequestException ex)
    {
        // Handle other HTTP errors
        Console.WriteLine($"HTTP error occurred: {ex.Message}");
        throw new ServiceException("Error communicating with the user service", ex);
    }
    catch (JsonException ex)
    {
        // Handle JSON parsing errors
        Console.WriteLine($"Error parsing user data: {ex.Message}");
        throw new DataFormatException("Invalid user data format", ex);
    }
    catch (Exception ex)
    {
        // Handle any other unexpected errors
        Console.WriteLine($"Unexpected error retrieving user: {ex.Message}");
        throw;
    }
}
```

## Exception Filters with 'when' Clause

C# allows you to add conditions to catch blocks using the `when` keyword, which makes your exception handling more precise:

```csharp
try
{
    ProcessOrder(order);
}
catch (OrderException ex) when (ex.OrderId < 1000)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Error processing low-value order");
}
catch (OrderException ex) when (ex.OrderId >= 1000)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Error processing high-value order");
    // Alert manager for high-value orders
    NotifyManager(ex);
}
```

## Re-throwing Exceptions

Sometimes you want to catch an exception to log it or perform some action, but then let it continue up the call stack. There are two ways to do this:

```csharp
try
{
    // Code that might throw an exception
}
catch (Exception ex)
{
    // Log the exception
    LogException(ex);
    
    // Option 1: Re-throw the same exception with the original stack trace
    throw;
    
    // Option 2: Throw a new exception (loses original stack trace unless you include the original as inner exception)
    // throw new CustomException("A processed error occurred", ex);
}
```

Always use `throw;` (without an argument) if you want to preserve the original stack trace.

## Try-Catch-Finally with Using Statement

For proper resource management, combine try-catch with the `using` statement:

```csharp
try
{
    using (var connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString))
    {
        connection.Open();
        // Use the connection...
    } // Connection is automatically closed here
}
catch (SqlException ex)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Database error: {ex.Message}");
}
```

In C# 8.0 and later, this can be simplified with the using declaration:

```csharp
try
{
    using var connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString);
    connection.Open();
    // Use the connection...
} // Connection is automatically closed here
catch (SqlException ex)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Database error: {ex.Message}");
}
```

## Best Practices for Try-Catch Blocks

1. **Don't use exceptions for flow control** - exceptions should be exceptional
2. **Catch specific exceptions** - avoid catching `Exception` unless you're at the application boundary
3. **Keep try blocks small** - include only code that might throw the exceptions you're catching
4. **Don't swallow exceptions** - always log or handle them appropriately
5. **Use finally for cleanup** - ensure resources are properly released
6. **Consider exception filters** - use the `when` clause for more precise exception handling
7. **Preserve stack traces** - use `throw;` instead of `throw ex;` when re-throwing

## Summary

Try-catch blocks are an essential part of error handling in .NET applications. They allow you to:
- Attempt potentially problematic code in a controlled environment
- Handle specific types of exceptions with custom recovery strategies
- Ensure proper resource cleanup with finally blocks
- Create more robust applications that can recover from errors gracefully

By understanding the principles and best practices of exception handling with try-catch blocks, you can write more resilient applications that provide better user experiences even when things go wrong.

## Exercises

1. Create a calculator application that uses try-catch to handle various input errors.
2. Modify the file reading example to include proper resource disposal using the `using` statement.
3. Write a method that attempts to parse different data types (int, double, date) from user input with appropriate exception handling.
4. Implement a retry mechanism using try-catch for a network operation that might fail temporarily.
5. Create a custom exception class and use it in a try-catch block for a specific business rule violation.
