# Vue.js Router Installation

## Introduction

Navigation is a fundamental aspect of any web application. In traditional websites, moving between pages requires full-page reloads, which can lead to slower user experiences. Vue Router solves this problem by enabling navigation between views in your Vue.js applications without page refreshes, creating a smooth single-page application (SPA) experience.

In this tutorial, we'll learn how to install Vue Router and set it up in a Vue.js application. Vue Router is the official routing library for Vue.js and integrates deeply with its core to make building SPAs with Vue.js a breeze.

## What is Vue Router?

Vue Router is a navigation library that lets you map components to different URL paths, allowing users to navigate your application with:

- Nested route/view mapping
- Modular, component-based router configuration
- Route params, query, wildcards
- View transition effects powered by Vue.js' transition system
- Fine-grained navigation control
- Links with automatic active CSS classes
- HTML5 history mode or hash mode

Before we dive into the installation process, let's understand where Vue Router fits in the application architecture:

    D --> E[Views/Pages]
```

## Installation Methods

There are several ways to install Vue Router. Let's explore each option:

### Method 1: Using Vue CLI (Recommended for New Projects)

The easiest way to add Vue Router to a new project is to use Vue CLI, which offers an interactive project setup.

```bash
# Install Vue CLI if you haven't already
npm install -g @vue/cli

# Create a new project
vue create my-router-app

# Navigate into your project directory
cd my-router-app

# Add Vue Router using the Vue CLI plugin
vue add router
```

During this process, Vue CLI will ask if you want to use history mode (which we'll explain shortly) and will set up the project structure for you.

**Output:** After installation, Vue CLI will:
1. Add Vue Router as a dependency in your `package.json`
2. Create a `router` folder with configuration
3. Update your `main.js` file to use the router
4. Create example view components

### Method 2: Manual Installation (For Existing Projects)

If you're adding Vue Router to an existing project, you can install it via npm or yarn.

```bash
# Using npm
npm install vue-router@4

# Using yarn
yarn add vue-router@4
```

> **Note:** Vue Router 4 is for Vue.js 3, while Vue Router 3 is for Vue.js 2. Make sure to install the version compatible with your Vue.js version.

## Basic Setup

After installing Vue Router, you need to set it up in your application. Let's walk through the process:

### Creating the Router Instance

First, create a router configuration file (typically in `src/router/index.js`):

```js
// src/router/index.js
import { createRouter, createWebHistory } from 'vue-router'
import HomeView from '../views/HomeView.vue'
import AboutView from '../views/AboutView.vue'

const routes = [
  {
    path: '/',
    name: 'home',
    component: HomeView
  },
  {
    path: '/about',
    name: 'about',
    component: AboutView
  }
]

const router = createRouter({
  history: createWebHistory(process.env.BASE_URL),
  routes
})

export default router
```

### Integrating the Router with Vue App

Next, you need to connect the router to your Vue application instance in the main file (typically `src/main.js`):

```js
// src/main.js
import { createApp } from 'vue'
import App from './App.vue'
import router from './router'

const app = createApp(App)
app.use(router)
app.mount('#app')
```

### Adding Router View and Links

In your main `App.vue` component, you need to add two key elements:
1. `<router-view>`: A component that displays the matched component for the current route
2. `<router-link>`: A component for navigation without full page reloads

```html
<!-- App.vue -->
<template>
  <div id="app">
    <nav>
      <router-link to="/">Home</router-link> |
      <router-link to="/about">About</router-link>
    </nav>
    <router-view/>
  </div>
</template>

<style>
nav {
  padding: 30px;
}

nav a {
  font-weight: bold;
  color: #2c3e50;
}

nav a.router-link-exact-active {
  color: #42b983;
}
</style>
```

## Router Modes

Vue Router supports two navigation modes:

### Hash Mode (Default in Vue 2)

In hash mode, the URL includes a hash character (`#`) which prevents the page from being reloaded when the URL changes:

```
https://example.com/#/about
```

To explicitly use hash mode:

```js
const router = createRouter({
  history: createWebHashHistory(),
  routes
})
```

### HTML5 History Mode (Default in Vue 3)

History mode uses the HTML5 History API to achieve URL navigation without a page reload:

```
https://example.com/about
```

This mode requires server configuration to properly handle URLs. For example, with Node.js/Express:

```js
const express = require('express')
const history = require('connect-history-api-fallback')
const app = express()

app.use(history())
app.use(express.static('dist'))
app.listen(3000)
```

## Real-World Example: Multi-Page Application

Let's build a simple blog with multiple pages to see Vue Router in action:

1. First, set up our router configuration:

```js
// src/router/index.js
import { createRouter, createWebHistory } from 'vue-router'
import Home from '../views/Home.vue'
import BlogList from '../views/BlogList.vue'
import BlogPost from '../views/BlogPost.vue'
import NotFound from '../views/NotFound.vue'

const routes = [
  {
    path: '/',
    name: 'home',
    component: Home
  },
  {
    path: '/blog',
    name: 'blog',
    component: BlogList
  },
  {
    path: '/blog/:id',
    name: 'blog-post',
    component: BlogPost,
    props: true // Pass route.params to the component as props
  },
  {
    // 404 page
    path: '/:pathMatch(.*)*',
    name: 'not-found',
    component: NotFound
  }
]

const router = createRouter({
  history: createWebHistory(),
  routes
})

export default router
```

2. Create a blog list view:

```html
<!-- src/views/BlogList.vue -->
<template>
  <div class="blog-list">
    <h1>Blog Posts</h1>
    <ul>
      <li v-for="post in posts" :key="post.id">
        <router-link :to="{ name: 'blog-post', params: { id: post.id } }">
          {{ post.title }}
        </router-link>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  data() {
    return {
      posts: [
        { id: 1, title: 'Getting Started with Vue 3' },
        { id: 2, title: 'Vue Router Fundamentals' },
        { id: 3, title: 'State Management with Pinia' }
      ]
    }
  }
}
</script>
```

3. Create a blog post detail view:

```html
<!-- src/views/BlogPost.vue -->
<template>
  <div v-if="post" class="blog-post">
    <h1>{{ post.title }}</h1>
    <p>{{ post.content }}</p>
    <router-link to="/blog">Back to Blog List</router-link>
  </div>
  <div v-else>
    <h1>Post not found</h1>
    <router-link to="/blog">Back to Blog List</router-link>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  props: ['id'],
  data() {
    return {
      posts: [
        { 
          id: 1, 
          title: 'Getting Started with Vue 3',
          content: 'Vue 3 is the latest version of the popular JavaScript framework...'
        },
        { 
          id: 2, 
          title: 'Vue Router Fundamentals',
          content: 'Routing is essential for creating single-page applications...'
        },
        { 
          id: 3, 
          title: 'State Management with Pinia',
          content: 'Pinia is the new recommended state management library for Vue...'
        }
      ]
    }
  },
  computed: {
    post() {
      return this.posts.find(post => post.id === parseInt(this.id))
    }
  }
}
</script>
```

This example demonstrates:
- Dynamic routes with parameters (`/blog/:id`)
- Using props for better component decoupling
- Navigation between routes using `<router-link>`
- 404 handling with wildcard routes

## Troubleshooting Common Installation Issues

### "Vue Router is not a constructor"

This error typically occurs when mixing Vue 2 with Vue Router 4 or Vue 3 with Vue Router 3. Ensure you're using compatible versions:
- Vue 2.x → Vue Router 3.x
- Vue 3.x → Vue Router 4.x

### Navigation Guards Not Working

If navigation guards aren't working, ensure they are placed in the correct location in your router configuration:

```js
const router = createRouter({
  // ...options
})

// Add navigation guards AFTER creating the router
router.beforeEach((to, from, next) => {
  // Your guard logic
  next()
})

export default router
```

### History Mode 404 Errors

If you're getting 404 errors with history mode, it's likely a server configuration issue. You need to configure your server to redirect all requests to `index.html`.
