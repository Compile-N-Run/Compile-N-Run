# Express File Uploads

## Introduction

File uploads are a common requirement in web applications. Whether it's uploading profile pictures, documents, or other media, handling file uploads efficiently and securely is essential for a good user experience. In Express.js, we can implement file upload functionality using middleware like Multer, which simplifies the process of handling multipart/form-data that is typically used for file uploads.

In this tutorial, we'll learn how to:
- Set up file upload middleware in Express
- Handle single and multiple file uploads
- Store uploaded files properly
- Implement file validation and security measures
- Process uploaded files

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have:
- Node.js and npm installed
- Basic knowledge of Express.js
- A text editor or IDE

## Understanding File Uploads in Express

By default, Express doesn't handle file uploads. This is because file uploads usually come as multipart/form-data, which requires special handling. To process file uploads, we use middleware that can parse this type of data.

### The Multipart/Form-Data Format

When a form includes a file input and uses the `enctype="multipart/form-data"` attribute, the browser sends the data in a special format that separates the form fields and files into "parts." Each part contains its own headers and body.

Here's an example of a simple HTML form for file upload:

```html
<form action="/upload" method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">
  <input type="file" name="myFile">
  <input type="text" name="description" placeholder="Description">
  <button type="submit">Upload</button>
</form>
```

## Using Multer for File Uploads

[Multer](https://github.com/expressjs/multer) is a middleware for Express that makes it easy to handle multipart/form-data, which is primarily used for file uploads. Let's see how to use it.

### Step 1: Install Multer

First, install Multer using npm:

```bash
npm install multer
```

### Step 2: Basic Setup

Here's a basic example of how to use Multer to handle a single file upload:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const multer = require('multer');
const path = require('path');

const app = express();

// Set up storage for uploaded files
const storage = multer.diskStorage({
  destination: (req, file, cb) => {
    cb(null, 'uploads/');
  },
  filename: (req, file, cb) => {
    cb(null, Date.now() + path.extname(file.originalname));
  }
});

// Create the multer instance
const upload = multer({ storage: storage });

// Serve static files from the uploads directory
app.use('/uploads', express.static('uploads'));

// Handle single file upload
app.post('/upload', upload.single('myFile'), (req, res) => {
  // req.file contains information about the uploaded file
  if (!req.file) {
    return res.status(400).send('No file uploaded.');
  }
  
  res.send({
    message: 'File uploaded successfully!',
    fileDetails: {
      name: req.file.originalname,
      size: req.file.size,
      mimetype: req.file.mimetype,
      path: req.file.path
    }
  });
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server is running on port 3000');
});
```

### Step 3: Create the Uploads Directory

Make sure to create an 'uploads' directory in your project root:

```bash
mkdir uploads
```

## Configuring Multer for Different Use Cases

Multer offers various options to customize file uploads based on your needs.

### Storage Engines

Multer provides two storage engines:

1. **DiskStorage**: Allows you to control where files are stored and how they are named.
2. **MemoryStorage**: Stores files in memory as Buffer objects.

#### Using Memory Storage

If you want to process files without saving them to disk:

```javascript
const storage = multer.memoryStorage();
const upload = multer({ storage: storage });

app.post('/upload', upload.single('myFile'), (req, res) => {
  // req.file.buffer contains the file data as a Buffer
  console.log(req.file.buffer);
  res.send('File processed!');
});
```

### File Filtering

You can filter files based on their types:

```javascript
const fileFilter = (req, file, cb) => {
  // Accept images only
  if (!file.originalname.match(/\.(jpg|jpeg|png|gif)$/)) {
    return cb(new Error('Only image files are allowed!'), false);
  }
  cb(null, true);
};

const upload = multer({ 
  storage: storage,
  fileFilter: fileFilter
});
```

### Size Limits

You can limit the file size:

```javascript
const upload = multer({
  storage: storage,
  limits: {
    fileSize: 1024 * 1024 * 5 // 5MB limit
  }
});
```

## Handling Multiple File Uploads

Multer can handle multiple files uploaded at once:

### Example HTML Form for Multiple Uploads

```html
<form action="/upload-multiple" method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">
  <input type="file" name="myFiles" multiple>
  <button type="submit">Upload Files</button>
</form>
```

### Express Route for Multiple Uploads

```javascript
app.post('/upload-multiple', upload.array('myFiles', 5), (req, res) => {
  if (!req.files || req.files.length === 0) {
    return res.status(400).send('No files uploaded.');
  }
  
  const fileDetails = req.files.map(file => {
    return {
      name: file.originalname,
      size: file.size,
      mimetype: file.mimetype,
      path: file.path
    };
  });
  
  res.send({
    message: `${req.files.length} files uploaded successfully!`,
    files: fileDetails
  });
});
```

## Handling Different Field Names

If your form has multiple file inputs with different names:

```html
<form action="/upload-fields" method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">
  <input type="file" name="avatar">
  <input type="file" name="gallery" multiple>
  <button type="submit">Upload</button>
</form>
```

You can handle this with `fields()`:

```javascript
const uploadFields = upload.fields([
  { name: 'avatar', maxCount: 1 },
  { name: 'gallery', maxCount: 5 }
]);

app.post('/upload-fields', uploadFields, (req, res) => {
  console.log('Avatar:', req.files.avatar);
  console.log('Gallery:', req.files.gallery);
  res.send('Files uploaded!');
});
```

## Error Handling

It's important to handle errors properly:

```javascript
app.post('/upload', (req, res) => {
  upload.single('myFile')(req, res, function(err) {
    if (err instanceof multer.MulterError) {
      // A Multer error occurred during upload
      if (err.code === 'LIMIT_FILE_SIZE') {
        return res.status(400).send('File too large! Max size is 5MB.');
      }
      return res.status(400).send(err.message);
    } else if (err) {
      // An unknown error occurred
      return res.status(500).send('Server error');
    }
    
    // Everything went fine
    res.send('File uploaded!');
  });
});
```

## Real-World Example: Profile Image Upload

Let's create a more complete example with a user profile image upload:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const multer = require('multer');
const path = require('path');
const fs = require('fs');

const app = express();
app.use(express.json());
app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true }));
app.use(express.static('public'));
app.use('/uploads', express.static('uploads'));

// Set up storage
const storage = multer.diskStorage({
  destination: (req, file, cb) => {
    const userId = req.body.userId || 'unknown';
    const dir = `uploads/users/${userId}`;
    
    // Create directory if it doesn't exist
    fs.mkdir(dir, { recursive: true }, (err) => {
      if (err) return cb(err);
      cb(null, dir);
    });
  },
  filename: (req, file, cb) => {
    // Generate unique filename
    const uniqueSuffix = Date.now() + '-' + Math.round(Math.random() * 1E9);
    cb(null, 'profile-' + uniqueSuffix + path.extname(file.originalname));
  }
});

// Set up file filter
const fileFilter = (req, file, cb) => {
  if (!file.originalname.match(/\.(jpg|jpeg|png)$/)) {
    return cb(new Error('Please upload an image file (jpg, jpeg, or png)'), false);
  }
  cb(null, true);
};

// Initialize upload middleware
const upload = multer({ 
  storage: storage,
  fileFilter: fileFilter,
  limits: { fileSize: 1024 * 1024 * 2 } // 2MB limit
});

// HTML form for testing
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send(`
    <h2>Upload Profile Picture</h2>
    <form action="/profile/upload" method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">
      <input type="hidden" name="userId" value="12345">
      <input type="file" name="profileImage">
      <button type="submit">Upload</button>
    </form>
  `);
});

// Handle profile image upload
app.post('/profile/upload', upload.single('profileImage'), (req, res) => {
  try {
    if (!req.file) {
      return res.status(400).send('Please select an image to upload');
    }
    
    const userId = req.body.userId || 'unknown';
    const imageUrl = `${req.protocol}://${req.get('host')}/${req.file.path}`;
    
    // In a real app, you would update the user profile in your database
    // Example: updateUserProfile(userId, { profileImage: imageUrl });
    
    res.status(200).json({
      message: 'Profile image uploaded successfully',
      userId: userId,
      profileImage: imageUrl
    });
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).send(`Error: ${error.message}`);
  }
});

// Error handler middleware
app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
  if (err instanceof multer.MulterError) {
    if (err.code === 'LIMIT_FILE_SIZE') {
      return res.status(400).send('File is too large. Max size is 2MB');
    }
    return res.status(400).send(err.message);
  }
  res.status(500).send('Something went wrong');
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server running on port 3000');
});
```

## Security Considerations

When implementing file uploads, always be mindful of security:

1. **Validate file types**: Only allow specific file extensions and MIME types.
2. **Limit file sizes**: Prevent users from uploading excessively large files.
3. **Store files outside the web root**: Don't store uploaded files in a location directly accessible by the web server.
4. **Rename files**: Don't use the original file names as they may contain malicious characters.
5. **Scan files for malware**: Consider using a virus scanning library for sensitive applications.
6. **Use cloud storage**: For production applications, consider using services like AWS S3 instead of local storage.

## Using Cloud Storage

For production apps, you might want to store files in the cloud. Here's a brief example using AWS S3 with the `multer-s3` package:

```bash
npm install aws-sdk multer-s3
```

```javascript
const aws = require('aws-sdk');
const multerS3 = require('multer-s3');

// Configure AWS
aws.config.update({
  secretAccessKey: process.env.AWS_SECRET_KEY,
  accessKeyId: process.env.AWS_ACCESS_KEY,
  region: process.env.AWS_REGION
});

const s3 = new aws.S3();

// Configure multer to use S3
const upload = multer({
  storage: multerS3({
    s3: s3,
    bucket: process.env.S3_BUCKET,
    acl: 'public-read',
    contentType: multerS3.AUTO_CONTENT_TYPE,
    key: (req, file, cb) => {
      const uniqueSuffix = Date.now() + '-' + Math.round(Math.random() * 1E9);
      cb(null, 'uploads/' + uniqueSuffix + path.extname(file.originalname));
    }
  }),
  limits: { fileSize: 5 * 1024 * 1024 } // 5MB
});

app.post('/upload', upload.single('myFile'), (req, res) => {
  res.json({ 
    success: true, 
    fileUrl: req.file.location // S3 URL of the uploaded file
  });
});
```
