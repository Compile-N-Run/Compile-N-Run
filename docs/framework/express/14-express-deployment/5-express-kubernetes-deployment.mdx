# Express Kubernetes Deployment

## Introduction

Kubernetes has become the industry standard for container orchestration, allowing developers to deploy, scale, and manage containerized applications with ease. In this guide, you'll learn how to deploy your Express.js application to a Kubernetes cluster, enabling you to build resilient, scalable web services that can handle production traffic.

By the end of this tutorial, you'll understand:
- How to containerize your Express application
- How to define Kubernetes resources
- How to deploy and expose your Express app in a Kubernetes cluster
- How to scale and update your application

## Prerequisites

Before starting this tutorial, ensure you have:
- Basic knowledge of Express.js
- A working Express application
- Docker installed on your machine
- A Kubernetes cluster (local with Minikube, or cloud-based)
- `kubectl` command-line tool installed and configured

## Containerizing Your Express Application

### Step 1: Create a Dockerfile

First, we need to package our Express application as a Docker container. Create a `Dockerfile` in your project's root directory:

```dockerfile
FROM node:16-alpine

# Create app directory
WORKDIR /usr/src/app

# Copy package files and install dependencies
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install

# Bundle app source
COPY . .

# Expose the port your app runs on
EXPOSE 3000

# Command to run the application
CMD ["node", "app.js"]
```

### Step 2: Build the Docker Image

From your project directory, build the Docker image:

```bash
docker build -t my-express-app:1.0.0 .
```

### Step 3: Test Your Container (Optional)

Before deploying to Kubernetes, test that your container works locally:

```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 my-express-app:1.0.0
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` to verify your app is running correctly.

### Step 4: Push to a Container Registry

For a Kubernetes cluster to pull your image, it needs to be in a container registry. Push your image to Docker Hub or another registry:

```bash
# Tag your image (replace 'yourusername' with your Docker Hub username)
docker tag my-express-app:1.0.0 yourusername/my-express-app:1.0.0

# Push to Docker Hub
docker push yourusername/my-express-app:1.0.0
```

## Defining Kubernetes Resources

### Step 1: Create a Kubernetes Deployment File

Create a file named `express-deployment.yaml`:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: express-app
  labels:
    app: express-app
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: express-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: express-app
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: express-app
        image: yourusername/my-express-app:1.0.0
        ports:
        - containerPort: 3000
        resources:
          limits:
            cpu: "0.5"
            memory: "512Mi"
          requests:
            cpu: "0.2"
            memory: "256Mi"
        env:
        - name: NODE_ENV
          value: "production"
```

This YAML file defines a Deployment that:
- Creates 3 replicas (instances) of your Express app
- Uses your Docker image
- Sets resource constraints for CPU and memory
- Sets an environment variable for production mode

### Step 2: Create a Service Resource

To expose your Express application to the outside world, create a file named `express-service.yaml`:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: express-app-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: express-app
  ports:
  - port: 80
    targetPort: 3000
  type: LoadBalancer
```

This service:
- Selects all pods with the `app: express-app` label
- Maps port 80 on the service to port 3000 on the pods
- Uses a LoadBalancer type to expose the service externally

## Deploying to Kubernetes

### Step 1: Apply the Deployment

Apply your deployment configuration to your Kubernetes cluster:

```bash
kubectl apply -f express-deployment.yaml
```

Verify your pods are running:

```bash
kubectl get pods

# Expected output:
# NAME                          READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
# express-app-7d8f7d8f7d-2k8mj   1/1     Running   0          30s
# express-app-7d8f7d8f7d-9j2n8   1/1     Running   0          30s
# express-app-7d8f7d8f7d-xr5nm   1/1     Running   0          30s
```

### Step 2: Apply the Service

Now, apply your service configuration:

```bash
kubectl apply -f express-service.yaml
```

Check that the service is running:

```bash
kubectl get services

# Expected output:
# NAME                  TYPE           CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP      PORT(S)        AGE
# express-app-service   LoadBalancer   10.100.200.30   203.0.113.42     80:32563/TCP   45s
```

Depending on your Kubernetes environment, the `EXTERNAL-IP` might take a moment to be assigned.

### Step 3: Access Your Application

Once the external IP is assigned, you can access your Express application at that IP address:

```bash
curl http://EXTERNAL-IP
# or open in a browser
```

## Adding a ConfigMap for Application Configuration

For better configuration management, let's use a ConfigMap to store application settings:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: express-app-config
data:
  APP_PORT: "3000"
  API_TIMEOUT: "5000"
  LOG_LEVEL: "info"
```

Save this as `express-configmap.yaml` and apply it:

```bash
kubectl apply -f express-configmap.yaml
```

Then update your deployment to use this ConfigMap:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: express-app
  # ...previous metadata
spec:
  # ...previous spec
  template:
    # ...previous template
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: express-app
        # ...previous container config
        envFrom:
        - configMapRef:
            name: express-app-config
```

Apply the updated deployment:

```bash
kubectl apply -f express-deployment.yaml
```

## Scaling Your Application

One of Kubernetes' key benefits is easy scaling. To scale your Express application:

```bash
kubectl scale deployment express-app --replicas=5
```

Verify the scaling:

```bash
kubectl get pods
# You should now see 5 pods running
```

## Rolling Updates

When you have a new version of your Express application:

1. Build and push the new Docker image with a new tag:

```bash
docker build -t yourusername/my-express-app:1.1.0 .
docker push yourusername/my-express-app:1.1.0
```

2. Update the image in your deployment file:

```yaml
spec:
  containers:
  - name: express-app
    image: yourusername/my-express-app:1.1.0
```

3. Apply the update:

```bash
kubectl apply -f express-deployment.yaml
```

Kubernetes will perform a rolling update, replacing pods one by one with the new version, ensuring zero downtime.

## Real-World Example: Express API with MongoDB and Redis

Let's see a more complete example of deploying an Express application with database dependencies.

### MongoDB StatefulSet and Service

Create `mongodb-statefulset.yaml`:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: StatefulSet
metadata:
  name: mongodb
spec:
  serviceName: mongodb-service
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mongodb
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mongodb
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: mongodb
        image: mongo:4.4
        ports:
        - containerPort: 27017
        volumeMounts:
        - name: mongodb-data
          mountPath: /data/db
  volumeClaimTemplates:
  - metadata:
      name: mongodb-data
    spec:
      accessModes: [ "ReadWriteOnce" ]
      resources:
        requests:
          storage: 1Gi
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: mongodb-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: mongodb
  ports:
  - port: 27017
    targetPort: 27017
  clusterIP: None  # Headless service for StatefulSet
```

### Redis Deployment and Service

Create `redis-deployment.yaml`:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: redis
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: redis
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: redis
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: redis
        image: redis:6-alpine
        ports:
        - containerPort: 6379
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: redis-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: redis
  ports:
  - port: 6379
    targetPort: 6379
```

### Updated Express Deployment

Now update your Express deployment to connect to these services:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: express-app
spec:
  # ... other specs
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: express-app
        image: yourusername/my-express-app:1.0.0
        env:
        - name: MONGODB_URI
          value: "mongodb://mongodb-service:27017/myapp"
        - name: REDIS_HOST
          value: "redis-service"
        - name: REDIS_PORT
          value: "6379"
```

Apply all configurations:

```bash
kubectl apply -f mongodb-statefulset.yaml
kubectl apply -f redis-deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f express-deployment.yaml
```

This setup gives you a complete stack with your Express application connected to MongoDB for data storage and Redis for caching or session management.

## Troubleshooting

### Viewing Logs

To troubleshoot issues with your Express application, check the logs:

```bash
# Get pod names
kubectl get pods
# View logs for a specific pod
kubectl logs express-app-7d8f7d8f7d-2k8mj
# Stream logs (follow)
kubectl logs -f express-app-7d8f7d8f7d-2k8mj
```

### Debugging with a Shell

To debug from inside a pod:

```bash
kubectl exec -it express-app-7d8f7d8f7d-2k8mj -- /bin/sh
```

### Checking Resource Usage

To see how your Express app is utilizing resources:

```bash
kubectl top pods
```
