# Express Performance Monitoring

## Introduction

Performance monitoring is a critical aspect of building scalable and efficient Express.js applications. Without proper monitoring, it's difficult to identify bottlenecks, understand how your application behaves under load, or know when to scale your resources. This guide will introduce you to different approaches and tools for monitoring Express application performance, helping you ensure your web services remain fast and responsive even as user demands increase.

Performance monitoring allows you to:

- Identify slow endpoints and database queries
- Understand memory usage patterns
- Track response times across different routes
- Detect and address performance bottlenecks
- Make data-driven optimization decisions

## Basic Performance Monitoring

### Creating Your First Performance Monitor

Let's start by implementing a simple middleware that measures response time for each request:

```javascript
const responseTimeMiddleware = (req, res, next) => {
  // Record start time
  const startTime = Date.now();
  
  // Once response is finished
  res.on('finish', () => {
    // Calculate duration
    const duration = Date.now() - startTime;
    console.log(`${req.method} ${req.originalUrl} - ${duration}ms`);
  });
  
  next();
};

// Use the middleware in your Express app
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.use(responseTimeMiddleware);

// Your routes below
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello World!');
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server listening on port 3000');
});
```

**Output example:**
```
GET / - 12ms
GET /about - 8ms
POST /api/users - 203ms
```

This basic monitoring gives you a starting point to identify which routes might be taking longer than expected.

## Advanced Monitoring with Express-Status-Monitor

For more comprehensive monitoring, you can use third-party packages. One popular option is `express-status-monitor`, which provides a real-time dashboard for your application.

### Installing and Setting Up Express-Status-Monitor

```bash
npm install express-status-monitor
```

Implementing it in your application is straightforward:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

// Import and use the status monitor
const statusMonitor = require('express-status-monitor');
app.use(statusMonitor());

// Your routes
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello World');
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server listening on port 3000');
});
```

After starting your application, you can access the dashboard at `/status`. It displays metrics like:

- CPU usage
- Memory usage
- Response time
- Request throughput
- Status codes distribution

This provides a much more comprehensive view of your application's performance than manual logging.

## Using APM (Application Performance Monitoring) Tools

For production applications, consider using APM tools that provide more sophisticated monitoring capabilities:

### Example with New Relic

First, install the New Relic agent:

```bash
npm install newrelic
```

Create a `newrelic.js` configuration file at your project root:

```javascript
'use strict'

exports.config = {
  app_name: ['My Express Application'],
  license_key: 'your_license_key_here',
  logging: {
    level: 'info'
  },
  allow_all_headers: true,
  attributes: {
    exclude: [
      'request.headers.cookie',
      'request.headers.authorization',
      'request.headers.proxyAuthorization',
      'request.headers.setCookie*',
      'request.headers.x*',
      'response.headers.cookie',
      'response.headers.authorization',
      'response.headers.proxyAuthorization',
      'response.headers.setCookie*',
      'response.headers.x*'
    ]
  }
}
```

Then, require New Relic at the very top of your main application file:

```javascript
require('newrelic');
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

// Rest of your application code
```

New Relic will now automatically track performance metrics, transaction traces, and error rates.

## Custom Performance Metrics

Beyond using pre-built tools, you can collect custom metrics specific to your application's needs.

### Measuring Database Query Performance

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const mongoose = require('mongoose');
const app = express();

// Middleware to measure database query time
const measureDbPerformance = async (req, res, next) => {
  const originalExec = mongoose.Query.prototype.exec;
  
  mongoose.Query.prototype.exec = async function() {
    const start = Date.now();
    const result = await originalExec.apply(this, arguments);
    const end = Date.now();
    
    console.log(`Query took ${end - start}ms: ${this.getQuery()}`);
    return result;
  };
  
  next();
};

app.use(measureDbPerformance);

// Your routes and database queries
app.get('/users', async (req, res) => {
  const users = await User.find();
  res.json(users);
});
```

**Sample output:**
```
Query took 45ms: { _id: { $exists: true } }
Query took 12ms: { username: "johndoe" }
```

### Measuring Function Execution Times

For complex operations, measure individual function performance:

```javascript
// Utility function for timing operations
function timeOperation(name, operation) {
  const start = Date.now();
  const result = operation();
  const duration = Date.now() - start;
  
  console.log(`Operation "${name}" took ${duration}ms`);
  return result;
}

// Example usage
app.get('/process-data', (req, res) => {
  const data = timeOperation('fetchData', () => {
    // Some expensive data fetching
    return fetchSomeData();
  });
  
  const processed = timeOperation('processData', () => {
    // Some expensive data processing
    return processData(data);
  });
  
  res.json(processed);
});
```

## Real-World Example: E-commerce API Monitoring

Let's implement a more comprehensive monitoring solution for an e-commerce API:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const prometheus = require('prom-client');
const responseTime = require('response-time');

// Initialize Prometheus metrics
const collectDefaultMetrics = prometheus.collectDefaultMetrics;
collectDefaultMetrics({ timeout: 5000 });

// Custom metrics
const httpRequestDurationMicroseconds = new prometheus.Histogram({
  name: 'http_request_duration_ms',
  help: 'Duration of HTTP requests in ms',
  labelNames: ['method', 'route', 'status_code'],
  buckets: [5, 10, 25, 50, 100, 250, 500, 1000, 2500, 5000]
});

const databaseQueryDurationMicroseconds = new prometheus.Histogram({
  name: 'database_query_duration_ms',
  help: 'Duration of database queries in ms',
  labelNames: ['operation', 'collection'],
  buckets: [1, 5, 10, 25, 50, 100, 250, 500, 1000]
});

// Middleware to record response time
app.use(responseTime((req, res, time) => {
  if (req.path !== '/metrics') {
    httpRequestDurationMicroseconds
      .labels(req.method, req.route?.path || req.path, res.statusCode)
      .observe(time);
  }
}));

// Database operation simulation with timing
function queryDatabase(operation, collection, callback) {
  const startTime = Date.now();
  
  // Simulate database operation
  setTimeout(() => {
    const duration = Date.now() - startTime;
    databaseQueryDurationMicroseconds
      .labels(operation, collection)
      .observe(duration);
    
    callback();
  }, Math.random() * 100);
}

// Sample routes
app.get('/api/products', (req, res) => {
  queryDatabase('find', 'products', () => {
    res.json({ products: [/* product data */] });
  });
});

app.get('/api/orders/:id', (req, res) => {
  queryDatabase('findOne', 'orders', () => {
    res.json({ order: { /* order data */ } });
  });
});

// Expose metrics endpoint for Prometheus
app.get('/metrics', async (req, res) => {
  res.set('Content-Type', prometheus.register.contentType);
  res.end(await prometheus.register.metrics());
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('E-commerce API with monitoring running on port 3000');
});
```

This implementation:
1. Records HTTP request durations with route, method, and status code labels
2. Tracks database query performance by operation and collection
3. Exposes metrics in Prometheus format that can be scraped and visualized in tools like Grafana

## Best Practices for Performance Monitoring

1. **Focus on key metrics**: Response time, error rate, and throughput are the most important metrics to track.

2. **Set performance baselines**: Establish what "normal" performance looks like so you can quickly identify abnormal patterns.

3. **Use percentiles, not averages**: Track p95 or p99 response times to understand the experience of all users, not just the average case:

```javascript
// Example of tracking percentiles
const responseTimes = [];

app.use((req, res, next) => {
  const start = Date.now();
  
  res.on('finish', () => {
    const duration = Date.now() - start;
    responseTimes.push(duration);
    
    // Keep the array size manageable
    if (responseTimes.length > 1000) {
      responseTimes.shift();
    }
    
    // Calculate percentiles (simple implementation)
    if (responseTimes.length > 0 && responseTimes.length % 100 === 0) {
      const sorted = [...responseTimes].sort((a, b) => a - b);
      const p50 = sorted[Math.floor(sorted.length * 0.5)];
      const p95 = sorted[Math.floor(sorted.length * 0.95)];
      const p99 = sorted[Math.floor(sorted.length * 0.99)];
      
      console.log(`Response time percentiles - p50: ${p50}ms, p95: ${p95}ms, p99: ${p99}ms`);
    }
  });
  
  next();
});
```

4. **Monitor in production**: Development environment performance rarely matches production reality.

5. **Track business-relevant metrics**: Connect technical metrics to business outcomes (e.g., correlation between response time and conversion rate).

## Monitoring Memory Usage and Leaks

Memory leaks can severely impact Express application performance. Here's how to monitor memory usage:

```javascript
const memoryUsageMiddleware = (req, res, next) => {
  next();
  
  // Check memory usage after request is complete
  const memoryUsage = process.memoryUsage();
  console.log({
    rss: `${Math.round(memoryUsage.rss / 1024 / 1024)} MB`,  // Resident Set Size
    heapTotal: `${Math.round(memoryUsage.heapTotal / 1024 / 1024)} MB`,
    heapUsed: `${Math.round(memoryUsage.heapUsed / 1024 / 1024)} MB`,
    external: `${Math.round(memoryUsage.external / 1024 / 1024)} MB`,
  });
};

app.use(memoryUsageMiddleware);
```

**Sample output:**
```
{
  rss: '78 MB',
  heapTotal: '42 MB',
  heapUsed: '38 MB',
  external: '1 MB'
}
```

For more advanced memory leak detection, consider tools like `memwatch-next` or `node-heapdump`.
