# Express Multer Integration

## Introduction

File uploads are a common requirement in web applications - whether it's for profile pictures, document sharing, or any other media content. Express.js doesn't have built-in middleware for handling multipart form data (the format used for file uploads), but thankfully, there's **Multer** - a powerful middleware specifically designed for this purpose.

In this guide, we'll explore how to integrate Multer with Express to handle file uploads efficiently. We'll start with basic concepts and progressively move to more advanced configurations.

## What is Multer?

Multer is a node.js middleware for handling `multipart/form-data`, which is primarily used for uploading files. It's built on top of [busboy](https://github.com/mscdex/busboy) for efficient processing of file uploads and is designed to work seamlessly with Express applications.

## Getting Started with Multer

### Installation

First, let's install Multer in our Express project:

```bash
npm install multer
```

### Basic Setup

Here's a simple example of integrating Multer with Express:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const multer = require('multer');
const path = require('path');
const app = express();

// Basic multer setup - store files in 'uploads/' directory
const upload = multer({ dest: 'uploads/' });

// Single file upload route
app.post('/upload', upload.single('file'), (req, res) => {
  // req.file contains information about the uploaded file
  if (!req.file) {
    return res.status(400).send('No file uploaded.');
  }
  
  res.send({
    message: 'File uploaded successfully!',
    fileDetails: req.file
  });
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server is running on port 3000');
});
```

In this example, when a user uploads a file to the `/upload` endpoint, Multer automatically:
1. Processes the incoming multipart form data
2. Stores the file in the 'uploads/' directory
3. Adds a `file` object to the request containing metadata about the uploaded file

### The `req.file` Object

When a file is uploaded, Multer adds a `file` object to the request. Here's what it typically looks like:

```javascript
{
  fieldname: 'file', // The field name specified in the form
  originalname: 'example.jpg', // Original filename
  encoding: '7bit', // File encoding
  mimetype: 'image/jpeg', // MIME type of the file
  destination: 'uploads/', // Where the file has been saved
  filename: '1a2b3c4d5e6f7g', // New filename (generated by Multer)
  path: 'uploads/1a2b3c4d5e6f7g', // Full path to the uploaded file
  size: 12345 // Size of the file in bytes
}
```

## Customizing Storage Options

### Using `diskStorage` for More Control

The basic setup uses default naming and locations, but for most applications, you'll want more control over file storage:

```javascript
const storage = multer.diskStorage({
  destination: (req, file, cb) => {
    // Set the destination where the file should be stored
    cb(null, 'uploads/');
  },
  filename: (req, file, cb) => {
    // Set the filename to be unique
    const uniqueSuffix = Date.now() + '-' + Math.round(Math.random() * 1E9);
    cb(null, file.fieldname + '-' + uniqueSuffix + path.extname(file.originalname));
  }
});

const upload = multer({ storage: storage });
```

This custom storage configuration:
1. Uses the `diskStorage` engine
2. Defines a custom destination for uploaded files
3. Creates unique filenames with the original file extension

### Using `memoryStorage` for In-Memory Processing

Sometimes you might want to process files in memory without saving them to disk first:

```javascript
const storage = multer.memoryStorage();
const upload = multer({ storage: storage });

app.post('/process-image', upload.single('image'), (req, res) => {
  // The file is available as a buffer in req.file.buffer
  const imageBuffer = req.file.buffer;
  
  // Process the image (e.g., resize, filter) using a library like Sharp
  // ...

  res.send('Image processed!');
});
```

This is useful for applications that need to manipulate files before storage or when integrating with cloud storage services.

## File Filtering

You can control which files are accepted using the `fileFilter` option:

```javascript
const fileFilter = (req, file, cb) => {
  // Accept only image files
  if (file.mimetype.startsWith('image/')) {
    cb(null, true);
  } else {
    cb(new Error('Not an image! Please upload an image.'), false);
  }
};

const upload = multer({ 
  storage: storage,
  fileFilter: fileFilter
});

app.post('/upload-image', upload.single('image'), (req, res) => {
  res.send('Image uploaded successfully!');
});
```

In this example, Multer will reject any file that isn't identified as an image type.

## Handling Multiple File Uploads

Multer provides different methods for handling multiple files:

### Multiple Files in a Single Field

```javascript
// Handle multiple files with the same field name
app.post('/upload-many', upload.array('photos', 5), (req, res) => {
  // req.files is an array of files
  if (!req.files || req.files.length === 0) {
    return res.status(400).send('No files uploaded.');
  }
  
  res.send({
    message: `${req.files.length} files uploaded successfully!`,
    files: req.files
  });
});
```

This route accepts up to 5 files in a field named 'photos'.

### Multiple Fields with Different Files

```javascript
// Handle multiple fields, each with their own file(s)
const multiUpload = upload.fields([
  { name: 'avatar', maxCount: 1 },
  { name: 'gallery', maxCount: 5 }
]);

app.post('/upload-profile', multiUpload, (req, res) => {
  // req.files is an object with fields as keys
  // req.files.avatar is an array with one file
  // req.files.gallery is an array of files
  
  const avatarUploaded = req.files.avatar && req.files.avatar.length > 0;
  const galleryUploaded = req.files.gallery && req.files.gallery.length > 0;
  
  res.send({
    avatarUploaded,
    galleryUploaded,
    avatarDetails: req.files.avatar,
    galleryCount: req.files.gallery ? req.files.gallery.length : 0
  });
});
```

This route handles different types of files in different fields simultaneously.

## Setting Upload Limits

You can set limits on uploaded files to prevent abuse:

```javascript
const upload = multer({
  storage: storage,
  limits: {
    fileSize: 1024 * 1024 * 5, // 5MB
    files: 5 // Maximum 5 files per request
  }
});
```

When these limits are exceeded, Multer will throw an error that you can handle.

## Error Handling with Multer

It's important to handle errors that might occur during file uploads:

```javascript
app.post('/upload', (req, res) => {
  upload.single('file')(req, res, (err) => {
    if (err instanceof multer.MulterError) {
      // A Multer error occurred when uploading
      if (err.code === 'LIMIT_FILE_SIZE') {
        return res.status(400).send('File too large! Maximum file size is 5MB.');
      }
      return res.status(400).send(err.message);
    } else if (err) {
      // An unknown error occurred
      return res.status(500).send('Server error occurred');
    }
    
    // Everything went fine
    res.send('File uploaded successfully!');
  });
});
```

This pattern gives you more control over how errors are handled and communicated to the user.

## Complete Example: Image Upload Application

Let's build a more complete example - a simple image upload application:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const multer = require('multer');
const path = require('path');
const fs = require('fs');

const app = express();
const PORT = 3000;

// Set up EJS for templates
app.set('view engine', 'ejs');
app.use(express.static('public'));
app.use('/uploads', express.static('uploads'));

// Ensure uploads directory exists
const uploadDir = path.join(__dirname, 'uploads');
if (!fs.existsSync(uploadDir)) {
  fs.mkdirSync(uploadDir);
}

// Configure multer
const storage = multer.diskStorage({
  destination: (req, file, cb) => {
    cb(null, 'uploads/');
  },
  filename: (req, file, cb) => {
    const uniqueName = `${Date.now()}-${Math.round(Math.random() * 1E9)}${path.extname(file.originalname)}`;
    cb(null, uniqueName);
  }
});

const fileFilter = (req, file, cb) => {
  // Accept images only
  if (!file.originalname.match(/\.(jpg|jpeg|png|gif)$/)) {
    return cb(new Error('Only image files are allowed!'), false);
  }
  cb(null, true);
};

const upload = multer({
  storage: storage,
  fileFilter: fileFilter,
  limits: { fileSize: 5 * 1024 * 1024 } // 5MB
});

// Routes
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  // Read the uploads directory and get image list
  fs.readdir(uploadDir, (err, files) => {
    if (err) {
      return res.status(500).send('Error reading uploads directory');
    }
    
    const images = files.filter(file => {
      return file.match(/\.(jpg|jpeg|png|gif)$/);
    }).map(file => `/uploads/${file}`);
    
    res.render('index', { images });
  });
});

app.post('/upload', upload.single('image'), (req, res) => {
  if (!req.file) {
    return res.status(400).send('No image uploaded');
  }
  
  res.redirect('/');
});

// Error handler
app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
  if (err instanceof multer.MulterError) {
    if (err.code === 'LIMIT_FILE_SIZE') {
      return res.status(400).send('File too large (max: 5MB)');
    }
    return res.status(400).send(err.message);
  } else if (err) {
    return res.status(400).send(err.message);
  }
  next();
});

app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server running on http://localhost:${PORT}`);
});
```

To complete this example, create a views directory with an `index.ejs` file:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Image Upload Gallery</title>
  <style>
    body { font-family: Arial, sans-serif; max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto; padding: 20px; }
    .upload-form { margin: 20px 0; padding: 20px; border: 1px solid #ddd; border-radius: 5px; }
    .gallery { display: grid; grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(200px, 1fr)); gap: 10px; }
    .gallery img { width: 100%; height: 200px; object-fit: cover; border-radius: 5px; }
    .error { color: red; }
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Image Upload Gallery</h1>
  
  <div class="upload-form">
    <h2>Upload a New Image</h2>
    <form action="/upload" method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">
      <input type="file" name="image" required>
      <button type="submit">Upload</button>
    </form>
  </div>
  
  <h2>Your Images</h2>
  <div class="gallery">
    <% if(images && images.length > 0) { %>
      <% images.forEach(image => { %>
        <img src="<%= image %>" alt="Uploaded image">
      <% }); %>
    <% } else { %>
      <p>No images uploaded yet.</p>
    <% } %>
  </div>
</body>
</html>
```

This application:
1. Displays a form for uploading images
2. Shows a gallery of previously uploaded images
3. Implements file filtering to accept only images
4. Sets size limits and handles errors gracefully
5. Uses EJS templates for rendering the UI

## Best Practices

1. **Always validate and sanitize file uploads**
   - Verify file types, sizes, and content when possible
   - Don't trust client-side validation alone

2. **Use unique filenames**
   - Prevent overwriting existing files
   - Consider including user information if relevant

3. **Set reasonable limits**
   - Restrict file sizes based on your application needs
   - Limit the number of files that can be uploaded at once

4. **Handle errors gracefully**
   - Provide clear feedback to users when uploads fail
   - Log errors on the server side for debugging

5. **Consider security implications**
   - Store files outside the public web root when possible
   - Scan for malicious content in uploads if necessary
   - Use cloud storage services for production applications

6. **Clean up temporary files**
   - Remove partially uploaded or invalid files
   - Consider periodic cleanup of unused uploads

## Exercises

1. **Basic Implementation**: Create a simple Express application that allows uploading a profile picture and displays it on the user profile page.

2. **Multiple File Gallery**: Extend the sample application to allow selecting and uploading multiple files at once, with server-side validation.

3. **File Type Restriction**: Create a document sharing application that only accepts PDFs and Office documents (.docx, .xlsx).

4. **Cloud Storage Integration**: Modify the sample application to store uploaded files in a cloud storage service like AWS S3 instead of the local filesystem.

5. **Progress Tracking**: Add upload progress tracking to the frontend using XHR or Fetch API with appropriate backend handling.
