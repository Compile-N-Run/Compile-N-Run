# Express File Uploads

File uploads are a common requirement in modern web applications. Whether it's uploading profile pictures, documents, or other media, the ability to handle file uploads efficiently is an essential skill for web developers. In this guide, we'll explore how to implement file uploads in Express.js applications.

## Introduction to File Uploads in Express

Express.js doesn't handle file uploads out of the box. To work with file uploads, we need to use middleware that can parse multipart form data. The most popular middleware for this purpose is **Multer**.

Multer is a middleware designed specifically for handling `multipart/form-data`, which is primarily used for uploading files through HTML forms. It adds a `files` or `file` object to the request body, which contains the files uploaded via the form.

## Getting Started with Multer

### Step 1: Installation

First, let's install Multer in our Express project:

```bash
npm install multer
```

### Step 2: Basic Setup

Here's how to set up a basic file upload using Multer:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const multer = require('multer');
const path = require('path');

const app = express();

// Configure storage
const storage = multer.diskStorage({
  destination: function(req, file, cb) {
    cb(null, 'uploads/');
  },
  filename: function(req, file, cb) {
    cb(null, file.fieldname + '-' + Date.now() + path.extname(file.originalname));
  }
});

// Initialize upload
const upload = multer({ storage: storage });

// Set up the upload route
app.post('/upload', upload.single('myFile'), (req, res) => {
  if (!req.file) {
    return res.status(400).send('No file was uploaded.');
  }
  
  res.send(`File uploaded successfully! Details: ${JSON.stringify(req.file)}`);
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server is running on port 3000');
});
```

In this example:
- We configure Multer with `diskStorage` to save files to a specific location
- We specify where to store the file (`destination`) and how to name it (`filename`)
- `upload.single('myFile')` indicates that we expect a single file with the field name 'myFile'

### Step 3: Create a Simple HTML Form

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>File Upload Form</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Upload a File</h1>
  <form action="/upload" method="POST" enctype="multipart/form-data">
    <input type="file" name="myFile">
    <input type="submit" value="Upload">
  </form>
</body>
</html>
```

Make sure to set the form's `enctype` attribute to "multipart/form-data" to properly handle file uploads.

## Advanced Multer Features

### Uploading Multiple Files

If you need to upload multiple files in a single field:

```javascript
// Upload route for multiple files
app.post('/upload-multiple', upload.array('myFiles', 5), (req, res) => {
  if (!req.files || req.files.length === 0) {
    return res.status(400).send('No files were uploaded.');
  }
  
  res.send(`${req.files.length} files uploaded successfully!`);
});
```

The HTML form would look like:

```html
<form action="/upload-multiple" method="POST" enctype="multipart/form-data">
  <input type="file" name="myFiles" multiple>
  <input type="submit" value="Upload Multiple Files">
</form>
```

### Filtering File Types

For security reasons, you often want to restrict the types of files that users can upload:

```javascript
const fileFilter = (req, file, cb) => {
  // Accept only specific file types
  if (file.mimetype === 'image/jpeg' || file.mimetype === 'image/png') {
    cb(null, true); // Accept the file
  } else {
    cb(new Error('Only JPEG and PNG files are allowed!'), false); // Reject the file
  }
};

const upload = multer({ 
  storage: storage,
  fileFilter: fileFilter 
});
```

### Setting File Size Limits

To prevent users from uploading large files that could overwhelm your server:

```javascript
const upload = multer({ 
  storage: storage,
  limits: {
    fileSize: 1024 * 1024 * 5 // 5MB in bytes
  }
});
```

## Error Handling for File Uploads

Handling errors properly is important for a good user experience:

```javascript
app.post('/upload', (req, res) => {
  upload.single('myFile')(req, res, function(err) {
    if (err instanceof multer.MulterError) {
      // A Multer error occurred (e.g., file size limit exceeded)
      return res.status(400).send(`Multer error: ${err.message}`);
    } else if (err) {
      // An unknown error occurred
      return res.status(500).send(`Unknown error: ${err.message}`);
    }
    
    // Everything went fine
    if (!req.file) {
      return res.status(400).send('No file was uploaded.');
    }
    
    res.send(`File uploaded successfully! Details: ${JSON.stringify(req.file)}`);
  });
});
```

## Real-World Application: Profile Picture Upload

Let's create a simple user profile picture upload system:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const multer = require('multer');
const path = require('path');
const fs = require('fs');

const app = express();
app.use(express.static('public'));
app.use('/uploads', express.static('uploads'));

// Configure storage for profile pictures
const storage = multer.diskStorage({
  destination: function(req, file, cb) {
    const uploadDir = 'uploads/profiles';
    
    // Create directory if it doesn't exist
    if (!fs.existsSync(uploadDir)) {
      fs.mkdirSync(uploadDir, { recursive: true });
    }
    
    cb(null, uploadDir);
  },
  filename: function(req, file, cb) {
    const userId = req.body.userId || 'user';
    cb(null, `profile-${userId}-${Date.now()}${path.extname(file.originalname)}`);
  }
});

// Filter for images only
const fileFilter = (req, file, cb) => {
  if (file.mimetype.startsWith('image/')) {
    cb(null, true);
  } else {
    cb(new Error('Only image files are allowed!'), false);
  }
};

const upload = multer({ 
  storage: storage,
  fileFilter: fileFilter,
  limits: {
    fileSize: 1024 * 1024 * 2 // 2MB limit
  } 
});

// Set up the profile picture upload route
app.post('/profile/upload', upload.single('profilePic'), (req, res) => {
  if (!req.file) {
    return res.status(400).send('No file was uploaded.');
  }
  
  // In a real app, you would save the file path to a user's profile in a database
  const filePath = req.file.path.replace('\\', '/');
  const fileUrl = `/${filePath}`;
  
  res.json({
    success: true,
    message: 'Profile picture uploaded successfully!',
    fileUrl: fileUrl
  });
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server is running on port 3000');
});
```

HTML form for profile picture upload:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Profile Picture Upload</title>
  <style>
    .preview {
      width: 200px;
      height: 200px;
      border-radius: 50%;
      object-fit: cover;
      border: 1px solid #ddd;
      margin: 10px 0;
      display: none;
    }
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Update Your Profile Picture</h1>
  
  <form id="profileForm">
    <input type="hidden" name="userId" value="12345">
    <input type="file" id="profilePic" name="profilePic" accept="image/*" onchange="previewImage(this)">
    <img id="preview" class="preview" src="#" alt="Profile preview">
    <button type="submit">Upload</button>
  </form>
  
  <div id="message"></div>
  
  <script>
    function previewImage(input) {
      const preview = document.getElementById('preview');
      if (input.files && input.files[0]) {
        const reader = new FileReader();
        reader.onload = function(e) {
          preview.src = e.target.result;
          preview.style.display = 'block';
        };
        reader.readAsDataURL(input.files[0]);
      }
    }
    
    document.getElementById('profileForm').addEventListener('submit', async function(e) {
      e.preventDefault();
      
      const formData = new FormData(this);
      
      try {
        const response = await fetch('/profile/upload', {
          method: 'POST',
          body: formData
        });
        
        const result = await response.json();
        
        document.getElementById('message').innerHTML = 
          `<p>${result.message}</p>
           <p>Your new profile picture: <img src="${result.fileUrl}" width="100" height="100"></p>`;
      } catch (error) {
        document.getElementById('message').innerHTML = `<p>Error: ${error.message}</p>`;
      }
    });
  </script>
</body>
</html>
```

## Best Practices for File Uploads

1. **Validate Files**: Always check file types, sizes, and content before processing
2. **Use File Size Limits**: Prevent server overload by limiting file sizes
3. **Store Files Properly**: Consider using dedicated storage services for production (AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, etc.)
4. **Handle Errors Gracefully**: Provide clear feedback to users when uploads fail
5. **Sanitize Filenames**: Avoid security vulnerabilities by sanitizing and validating filenames
6. **Use Virus Scanning**: For sensitive applications, scan files for malware
7. **Clean Up Temporary Files**: Don't leave unused uploaded files on your server
8. **Consider Authentication**: Secure your upload routes to prevent unauthorized uploads

## Memory Storage vs. Disk Storage

Multer offers two storage options:

### Disk Storage

As we've seen in the examples above, `diskStorage` saves files to your server's file system. This is good for most applications.

### Memory Storage

You can also store files in memory (as Buffer objects) using `memoryStorage`:

```javascript
const storage = multer.memoryStorage();
const upload = multer({ storage: storage });

app.post('/memory-upload', upload.single('myFile'), (req, res) => {
  // req.file.buffer contains the file data as a Buffer
  console.log(`Received file ${req.file.originalname} with size ${req.file.buffer.length} bytes`);
  
  // Process the file in memory or save it using a different method
  
  res.send('File uploaded to memory');
});
```

Memory storage is useful when you want to process files without saving them to disk first, or when you're using a cloud storage service.
