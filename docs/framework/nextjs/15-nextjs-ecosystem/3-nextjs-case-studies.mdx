  const { locale } = params;
  const contentData = await fetchContentForLocale(locale);
  
  return {
    props: {
      content: contentData,
      locale
    },
    revalidate: 60 * 10 // Revalidate every 10 minutes
  };
}
```

import { Suspense } from 'react';

// Dynamically import the video player component
const VideoPlayer = dynamic(() => import('../components/VideoPlayer'), {
  loading: () => <VideoPlaceholder />,
  ssr: false // Don't render on server for video player
});

export default function ContentPage({ show }) {
  return (
    <div className="content-page">
      <h1>{show.title}</h1>
      <Suspense fallback={<p>Loading recommendations...</p>}>
        <RecommendationPanel userId={user.id} />
      </Suspense>
      
      <VideoPlayer 
        videoId={show.videoId} 
        startPosition={user.watchHistory[show.id] || 0} 
      />
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Results

After implementing Next.js:
- 30% reduction in page load time
- Improved user engagement metrics
- Higher conversion rates from free to paid subscribers
- Better developer experience and faster deployment cycles

## Case Study 4: Twitch's Dashboard

Twitch used Next.js to build a new streamer dashboard with improved performance and real-time capabilities.

```jsx
// Example of how Twitch might implement real-time updates with SWR
import useSWR from 'swr';

function StreamerStats({ channelId }) {
  // Fetch data with automatic revalidation
  const { data, error } = useSWR(
    `/api/channel-stats/${channelId}`,
    fetcher,
    { refreshInterval: 5000 } // Refresh every 5 seconds
  );

  if (error) return <div>Failed to load stats</div>;
  if (!data) return <div>Loading stats...</div>;

  return (
    <div className="stats-dashboard">
      <ViewerCount count={data.liveViewers} />
      <SubscriberGrowth data={data.subscriberTrend} />
      <ChatActivity messages={data.recentChats} />
    </div>
  );

## Lessons Learned from Case Studies

After examining these case studies, several common themes emerge:

1. **Performance Wins**: Next.js consistently delivers performance improvements through its hybrid rendering approach.

2. **Developer Experience**: Organizations repeatedly mention improved developer productivity and satisfaction.

3. **Scalability**: Next.js scales effectively for high-traffic applications with global audiences.

4. **Hybrid Rendering Strategy**: Most companies utilize a mix of rendering strategies (SSR, SSG, ISR, CSR) depending on content type.

5. **Incremental Adoption**: Many companies gradually migrated to Next.js rather than rewriting their entire application at once.

## Implementing Your Own Case Study

If you're considering Next.js for your project, consider these steps based on the case studies:

1. **Identify Performance Bottlenecks**: Use tools like Lighthouse to identify areas for improvement.

2. **Choose the Right Rendering Strategy**:
