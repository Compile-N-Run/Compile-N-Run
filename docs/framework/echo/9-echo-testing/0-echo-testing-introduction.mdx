# Echo Testing Introduction

## What is Echo Testing?

Echo testing is one of the simplest yet most effective techniques in a programmer's toolkit. At its core, echo testing involves using print statements (like `echo`, `print`, `console.log`, etc.) to display information about your program while it's running. This allows you to verify values, check program flow, and identify bugs without needing complex debugging tools.

For beginners, echo testing provides a straightforward way to understand what's happening inside your code. Think of it as adding windows into your program to peek inside.

## Why Use Echo Testing?

While professional developers often use sophisticated debugging tools, echo testing remains valuable because:

1. **Simplicity**: No special tools required beyond what's included in your programming language
2. **Visibility**: Directly shows you what's happening in your code
3. **Validation**: Quickly confirms whether variables contain expected values
4. **Tracing**: Helps track the flow of execution through your program

## Basic Echo Testing Techniques

### 1. Value Inspection

The most basic form of echo testing is simply outputting a variable's value:

```python
# Python example
user_age = 25
print(f"User age: {user_age}")
```

Output:
```
User age: 25
```

```javascript
// JavaScript example
let userName = "Alex";
console.log(`User name: ${userName}`);
```

Output:
```
User name: Alex
```

### 2. Execution Flow Tracking

Add print statements at different points in your program to track how it executes:

```python
def calculate_discount(price, discount_percentage):
    print(f"Starting calculation with price: {price}, discount: {discount_percentage}%")
    
    if discount_percentage < 0 or discount_percentage > 100:
        print("Invalid discount percentage")
        return price
    
    discount = price * (discount_percentage / 100)
    print(f"Discount amount: {discount}")
    
    final_price = price - discount
    print(f"Final price after discount: {final_price}")
    
    return final_price

# Test the function
result = calculate_discount(100, 20)
print(f"Function returned: {result}")
```

Output:
```
Starting calculation with price: 100, discount: 20%
Discount amount: 20.0
Final price after discount: 80.0
Function returned: 80.0
```

### 3. Debugging Conditional Logic

Use echo testing to verify which path your conditionals are taking:

```javascript
function determineShipping(orderTotal) {
  console.log(`Checking shipping for order total: $${orderTotal}`);
  
  if (orderTotal >= 100) {
    console.log("Eligible for free shipping");
    return 0;
  } else if (orderTotal >= 50) {
    console.log("Applying reduced shipping");
    return 5.99;
  } else {
    console.log("Applying standard shipping");
    return 9.99;
  }
}

// Test with different values
console.log(`Shipping for $120 order: $${determineShipping(120)}`);
console.log(`Shipping for $75 order: $${determineShipping(75)}`);
console.log(`Shipping for $25 order: $${determineShipping(25)}`);
```

Output:
```
Checking shipping for order total: $120
Eligible for free shipping
Shipping for $120 order: $0

Checking shipping for order total: $75
Applying reduced shipping
Shipping for $75 order: $5.99

Checking shipping for order total: $25
Applying standard shipping
Shipping for $25 order: $9.99
```

## Advanced Echo Testing Techniques

### 1. Formatted Output

Making your echo tests readable helps when dealing with complex data:

```python
def analyze_student_scores(scores):
    print("=" * 30)
    print("STUDENT SCORE ANALYSIS")
    print("=" * 30)
    
    print(f"Number of scores: {len(scores)}")
    print(f"Lowest score: {min(scores)}")
    print(f"Highest score: {max(scores)}")
    print(f"Average score: {sum(scores) / len(scores):.2f}")
    
    print("-" * 30)

# Test the function
analyze_student_scores([85, 90, 78, 92, 88])
```

Output:
```
==============================
STUDENT SCORE ANALYSIS
==============================
Number of scores: 5
Lowest score: 78
Highest score: 92
Average score: 86.60
------------------------------
```

### 2. Conditional Echo Testing

You might not want to print everything all the time. Use flags to control what gets printed:

```javascript
function processData(data, debug = false) {
  if (debug) console.log("Processing data:", data);
  
  // Data transformation
  const processed = data.map(item => item * 2);
  
  if (debug) console.log("Processed data:", processed);
  
  // Calculate sum
  const sum = processed.reduce((total, num) => total + num, 0);
  
  if (debug) console.log("Sum calculated:", sum);
  
  return sum;
}

// Run without debug output
console.log("Result without debug:", processData([1, 2, 3, 4]));

// Run with debug output
console.log("Result with debug:", processData([1, 2, 3, 4], true));
```

Output:
```
Result without debug: 20
Processing data: [ 1, 2, 3, 4 ]
Processed data: [ 2, 4, 6, 8 ]
Sum calculated: 20
Result with debug: 20
```

## Real-World Application: Debugging a Shopping Cart

Let's use echo testing to debug a simple shopping cart function:

```python
def calculate_cart_total(items, coupon_code=None):
    print(f"Starting cart calculation with {len(items)} items")
    
    if coupon_code:
        print(f"Coupon applied: {coupon_code}")
    
    subtotal = 0
    for i, item in enumerate(items):
        print(f"Item {i+1}: {item['name']} - ${item['price']}")
        subtotal += item['price']
    
    print(f"Subtotal: ${subtotal}")
    
    # Apply discount if coupon code is valid
    discount = 0
    if coupon_code == "SAVE10":
        discount = subtotal * 0.1
        print(f"Applying 10% discount: -${discount}")
    elif coupon_code == "SAVE20":
        discount = subtotal * 0.2
        print(f"Applying 20% discount: -${discount}")
    elif coupon_code and coupon_code not in ["SAVE10", "SAVE20"]:
        print(f"Warning: Invalid coupon code '{coupon_code}'")
    
    # Calculate tax
    tax_rate = 0.08
    tax = (subtotal - discount) * tax_rate
    print(f"Tax (8%): ${tax}")
    
    # Calculate final total
    total = subtotal - discount + tax
    print(f"Final total: ${total}")
    
    return total

# Test with a shopping cart
cart_items = [
    {"name": "T-shirt", "price": 15.99},
    {"name": "Jeans", "price": 39.99},
    {"name": "Shoes", "price": 59.95}
]

# Test with valid coupon
print("\nTEST 1: Valid coupon")
calculate_cart_total(cart_items, "SAVE10")

# Test with invalid coupon
print("\nTEST 2: Invalid coupon")
calculate_cart_total(cart_items, "INVALID")

# Test with no coupon
print("\nTEST 3: No coupon")
calculate_cart_total(cart_items)
```

Output:
```
TEST 1: Valid coupon
Starting cart calculation with 3 items
Coupon applied: SAVE10
Item 1: T-shirt - $15.99
Item 2: Jeans - $39.99
Item 3: Shoes - $59.95
Subtotal: $115.93
Applying 10% discount: -$11.593
Tax (8%): $8.346959999999999
Final total: $112.68395999999999

TEST 2: Invalid coupon
Starting cart calculation with 3 items
Coupon applied: INVALID
Item 1: T-shirt - $15.99
Item 2: Jeans - $39.99
Item 3: Shoes - $59.95
Subtotal: $115.93
Warning: Invalid coupon code 'INVALID'
Tax (8%): $9.2744
Final total: $125.2044

TEST 3: No coupon
Starting cart calculation with 3 items
Item 1: T-shirt - $15.99
Item 2: Jeans - $39.99
Item 3: Shoes - $59.95
Subtotal: $115.93
Tax (8%): $9.2744
Final total: $125.2044
```

By examining the output, we can easily verify:
1. Each item's price is correctly added to the subtotal
2. Discount calculations work for valid coupons
3. Invalid coupon codes are properly detected
4. Tax is calculated correctly on the discounted amount
5. The final total makes sense

## When to Use Echo Testing vs. Other Methods

Echo testing is ideal for:
- Quick checks during development
- Basic debugging of function logic
- Understanding code flow in unfamiliar programs
- Teaching and learning programming concepts

However, for more complex scenarios, consider:
- Using a proper debugger for step-by-step execution
- Writing formal unit tests for comprehensive validation
- Logging frameworks for production environments

## Summary

Echo testing is a fundamental programming skill that helps you understand and debug your code. By strategically placing print statements, you can:

- Monitor variable values
- Track program execution flow
- Verify conditional logic
- Debug complex functions

Even though professional developers often use sophisticated debugging tools, echo testing remains valuable for its simplicity and immediacy. As you grow as a developer, echo testing will remain a useful technique in your toolbox.

## Practice Exercises

1. **Debug a Function**: Add echo testing to find why this function sometimes returns incorrect results:
   ```python
   def calculate_average(numbers):
       total = 0
       for num in numbers:
           total += num
       return total / len(numbers)
   ```
   (Hint: What happens if `numbers` is empty?)

2. **Improve Flow Tracking**: Enhance this function with echo testing to track the flow:
   ```javascript
   function processUserData(user) {
     if (!user.name) {
       return { error: "Name is required" };
     }
     
     const processedData = {
       username: user.name.toLowerCase().replace(' ', '_'),
       displayName: user.name,
       active: user.status === "active"
     };
     
     if (user.email) {
       processedData.contact = user.email;
     }
     
     return processedData;
   }
   ```

3. **Fix the Bug**: Use echo testing to find and fix the bug in this function:
   ```python
   def get_discount_price(original_price, discount_percentage):
       discount = original_price * discount_percentage
       return original_price - discount
   ```
   (Hint: Test with `get_discount_price(100, 20)`)
