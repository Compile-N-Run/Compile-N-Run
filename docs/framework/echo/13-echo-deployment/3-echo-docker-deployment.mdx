# Echo Docker Deployment

## Introduction

Deploying applications consistently across different environments is one of the most challenging aspects of software development. Docker simplifies this process by containerizing applications, ensuring they run the same way regardless of where they're deployed.

In this guide, we'll explore how to containerize and deploy an Echo web application using Docker. We'll cover everything from basic Docker concepts to creating optimized containers for your Echo applications, making your deployment process reliable and repeatable.

## Docker Basics for Echo Developers

### What is Docker?

Docker is a platform that packages your application and all its dependencies into a standardized unit called a container. Containers are lightweight, portable, and provide a consistent environment across development, testing, and production.

### Why use Docker with Echo?

1. **Consistency**: Eliminates "it works on my machine" problems
2. **Isolation**: Each application runs in its own container with its own dependencies
3. **Efficiency**: More resource-efficient than traditional virtual machines
4. **Scalability**: Easily scale your Echo applications with container orchestration tools
5. **DevOps Integration**: Simplifies continuous integration and deployment processes

## Setting Up Docker for Echo Applications

Before we begin, ensure you have:

1. [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed on your system
2. A basic Echo application ready to be containerized

### Creating a Basic Echo Application

Let's start with a simple Echo application. Create a new file named `main.go`:

```go
package main

import (
    "net/http"
    
    "github.com/labstack/echo/v4"
    "github.com/labstack/echo/v4/middleware"
)

func main() {
    // Create Echo instance
    e := echo.New()
    
    // Middleware
    e.Use(middleware.Logger())
    e.Use(middleware.Recover())
    
    // Routes
    e.GET("/", func(c echo.Context) error {
        return c.String(http.StatusOK, "Hello, Docker!")
    })
    
    // Start server
    e.Logger.Fatal(e.Start(":8080"))
}
```

Create a `go.mod` file:

```bash
go mod init echoapp
go get github.com/labstack/echo/v4
```

## Creating a Dockerfile for Echo

A Dockerfile contains instructions for building a Docker image. Let's create an optimized Dockerfile for our Echo application:

```dockerfile
# Build stage
FROM golang:1.21-alpine AS builder

WORKDIR /app

# Copy dependency files
COPY go.mod go.sum ./
RUN go mod download

# Copy the source code
COPY . .

# Build the application
RUN CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=linux go build -a -installsuffix cgo -o echoapp .

# Final stage
FROM alpine:latest

WORKDIR /root/

# Copy the binary from the build stage
COPY --from=builder /app/echoapp .

# Expose the application port
EXPOSE 8080

# Command to run the application
CMD ["./echoapp"]
```

This Dockerfile uses a multi-stage build approach:
1. The first stage compiles the Go application
2. The second stage creates a minimal image containing only the compiled binary

### Building the Docker Image

To build a Docker image from your Dockerfile:

```bash
docker build -t echoapp:latest .
```

Output:
```
Sending build context to Docker daemon  12.8MB
Step 1/12 : FROM golang:1.21-alpine AS builder
 ---> 8e96601a97dc
Step 2/12 : WORKDIR /app
 ---> Using cache
 ---> a5d6f43a8da4
...
Successfully built 3a9f8d4b2c1e
Successfully tagged echoapp:latest
```

### Running the Echo Container

Run your containerized Echo application:

```bash
docker run -p 8080:8080 echoapp:latest
```

Output:
```
â‡¨ http server started on [::]:8080
```

Now you can access your application at `http://localhost:8080`.

## Docker Configuration Best Practices for Echo

### Optimizing Image Size

Smaller images download faster and have a smaller attack surface. Use these techniques to optimize your Echo Docker images:

1. **Use multi-stage builds** as shown in our example
2. **Alpine-based images** which are significantly smaller
3. **Minimize layers** by combining related commands
4. **Exclude unnecessary files** using `.dockerignore`

Create a `.dockerignore` file:

```
.git
.gitignore
README.md
Dockerfile
docker-compose.yml
*.log
```

### Environment Variables

Use environment variables for configuration to make your container more flexible:

```dockerfile
# In Dockerfile
ENV PORT=8080
EXPOSE $PORT
CMD ./echoapp
```

Modified main.go to use environment variables:

```go
func main() {
    e := echo.New()
    
    port := os.Getenv("PORT")
    if port == "" {
        port = "8080"
    }
    
    // Routes and middleware setup...
    
    e.Logger.Fatal(e.Start(":" + port))
}
```

Running with a custom port:

```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 -e PORT=3000 echoapp:latest
```

## Docker Compose for Multi-Container Echo Applications

Many Echo applications need additional services like databases. Docker Compose helps manage multi-container applications.

Create a `docker-compose.yml` file:

```yaml
version: '3'

services:
  app:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    environment:
      - DB_HOST=db
      - DB_USER=postgres
      - DB_PASSWORD=password
      - DB_NAME=echodb
    depends_on:
      - db
  
  db:
    image: postgres:14-alpine
    volumes:
      - postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password
      - POSTGRES_DB=echodb

volumes:
  postgres_data:
```

Start all services with:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

## Deploying Echo Docker Containers in Production

### Container Health Checks

Add health checks to ensure your Echo application is responding properly:

```dockerfile
HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=3s --start-period=5s --retries=3 \
  CMD wget --quiet --tries=1 --spider http://localhost:8080/health || exit 1
```

Implement a health check endpoint in your Echo app:

```go
e.GET("/health", func(c echo.Context) error {
    return c.JSON(http.StatusOK, map[string]string{
        "status": "ok",
    })
})
```

### Production Deployment Strategies

Here are some popular options for deploying Echo Docker containers:

#### 1. Kubernetes

For complex applications that need scaling and automated management:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: echoapp
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: echoapp
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: echoapp
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: echoapp
        image: yourregistry/echoapp:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
        resources:
          limits:
            cpu: "0.5"
            memory: "512Mi"
          requests:
            cpu: "0.2"
            memory: "256Mi"
        livenessProbe:
          httpGet:
            path: /health
            port: 8080
          initialDelaySeconds: 5
          periodSeconds: 10
```

#### 2. AWS Elastic Container Service (ECS)

For AWS users, ECS provides a simpler way to deploy containers:

```json
{
  "family": "echoapp",
  "containerDefinitions": [
    {
      "name": "echoapp",
      "image": "yourregistry/echoapp:latest",
      "essential": true,
      "portMappings": [
        {
          "containerPort": 8080,
          "hostPort": 80
        }
      ],
      "memory": 512,
      "cpu": 256
    }
  ]
}
```

#### 3. Docker Swarm

For simpler deployments, Docker Swarm provides native clustering:

```bash
docker service create \
  --name echoapp \
  --replicas 3 \
  --publish published=80,target=8080 \
  yourregistry/echoapp:latest
```

## Docker Registry and Continuous Deployment

### Pushing to Docker Registry

To make your image available for deployment:

```bash
# Tag your image
docker tag echoapp:latest username/echoapp:latest

# Push to Docker Hub
docker push username/echoapp:latest
```

### Setting Up GitHub Actions for Automated Builds

Create a `.github/workflows/docker.yml` file:

```yaml
name: Build and Push Docker Image

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      
      - name: Log in to Docker Hub
        uses: docker/login-action@v1
        with:
          username: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME }}
          password: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_HUB_ACCESS_TOKEN }}
          
      - name: Build and push
        uses: docker/build-push-action@v2
        with:
          context: .
          push: true
          tags: username/echoapp:latest
```

## Advanced Docker Techniques for Echo

### Non-Root User for Security

Modify your Dockerfile to run as a non-root user:

```dockerfile
FROM alpine:latest

# Create app user and directory
RUN addgroup -S appgroup && adduser -S appuser -G appgroup
WORKDIR /app

# Copy binary from build stage
COPY --from=builder /app/echoapp .

# Set ownership
RUN chown -R appuser:appgroup /app

# Switch to app user
USER appuser

EXPOSE 8080
CMD ["./echoapp"]
```

### Optimizing for Different Environments

Use Docker build arguments to customize images:

```dockerfile
ARG GO_ENV=production
ENV GO_ENV=${GO_ENV}

# Conditionally include development tools
RUN if [ "$GO_ENV" = "development" ] ; then \
        apk add --no-cache git curl ; \
    fi
```

Build for development:

```bash
docker build --build-arg GO_ENV=development -t echoapp:dev .
```

## Troubleshooting Echo Docker Deployments

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **Application doesn't start**: Check your `EXPOSE` directive and port mappings
   ```bash
   docker logs <container_id>
   ```

2. **Can't connect to database**: Verify network settings in Docker Compose
   ```bash
   docker-compose exec db psql -U postgres -c "SELECT 1"
   ```

3. **Container exits immediately**: Make sure your Echo app is listening on the correct interface
   ```go
   // Change this:
   e.Start("localhost:8080")
   // To this:
   e.Start(":8080")
   ```

4. **Out of memory errors**: Set memory limits in Docker run command
   ```bash
   docker run --memory="512m" echoapp:latest
   ```
