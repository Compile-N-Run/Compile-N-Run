# Echo Installation

## Introduction

Echo is a high-performance, extensible, minimalist web framework for Go. It's designed to make building web applications and APIs easy while maintaining excellent performance. In this tutorial, we'll walk through the process of installing Echo and setting up your development environment to start building web applications with Go.

Before we begin, you should have:
- Go installed on your system (version 1.13 or later recommended)
- Basic understanding of Go programming language
- A code editor of your choice (VSCode, GoLand, etc.)

## Installing Go (Prerequisites)

If you haven't installed Go yet, you'll need to do that first:

1. Visit the [official Go download page](https://golang.org/dl/)
2. Download the appropriate installer for your operating system
3. Follow the installation instructions

To verify your Go installation, open a terminal or command prompt and run:

```bash
go version
```

You should see output similar to:

```
go version go1.19.3 windows/amd64
```

## Installing Echo Framework

There are two main approaches to install Echo in your Go project:

### Method 1: Using Go Modules (Recommended)

If you're using Go Modules (which is recommended for all new projects), follow these steps:

1. Create a new directory for your project:

```bash
mkdir my-echo-app
cd my-echo-app
```

2. Initialize a new Go module:

```bash
go mod init my-echo-app
```

3. Install Echo by running:

```bash
go get github.com/labstack/echo/v4
```

This command will download Echo and add it to your project's `go.mod` file.

### Method 2: Using GOPATH (Legacy Approach)

If you're using the older GOPATH approach:

```bash
go get -u github.com/labstack/echo/...
```

## Verifying Installation

Let's create a simple "Hello, World!" application to verify that Echo is installed correctly:

1. Create a file named `main.go`:

```go
package main

import (
	"net/http"
	
	"github.com/labstack/echo/v4"
)

func main() {
	// Create a new Echo instance
	e := echo.New()
	
	// Define a route
	e.GET("/", func(c echo.Context) error {
		return c.String(http.StatusOK, "Hello, Echo!")
	})
	
	// Start the server
	e.Logger.Fatal(e.Start(":8080"))
}
```

2. Run the application:

```bash
go run main.go
```

3. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080`.
   You should see "Hello, Echo!" displayed in your browser.

## Setting Up Your Development Environment

To enhance your development experience with Echo, consider the following tools and extensions:

### Code Editors

1. **Visual Studio Code**:
   - Install Go extension by Microsoft
   - Install Go Test Explorer for easy test running
   - Consider ESLint for JavaScript if you'll be building frontend components

2. **GoLand** by JetBrains:
   - Provides built-in support for Go and web development

### Live Reloading

For development, it's helpful to have a tool that automatically restarts your server when code changes. Air is a popular choice:

```bash
go get -u github.com/cosmtrek/air
```

Create an `.air.toml` configuration file:

```toml
root = "."
tmp_dir = "tmp"

[build]
  cmd = "go build -o ./tmp/main ."
  bin = "tmp/main"
  delay = 1000
  exclude_dir = ["assets", "tmp", "vendor"]
  include_ext = ["go", "tpl", "tmpl", "html"]
  exclude_regex = ["_test\\.go"]
```

Now you can run your application with:

```bash
air
```

## Project Structure

A typical Echo project might have the following structure:

```
my-echo-app/
├── go.mod
├── go.sum
├── main.go             # Entry point
├── handlers/           # Request handlers
├── models/             # Data models
├── middleware/         # Custom middleware
├── routes/             # Route definitions
├── config/             # Configuration
├── static/             # Static files (CSS, JS, images)
├── templates/          # HTML templates
└── tests/              # Test files
```

## Practical Example: Building a Simple API

Let's create a more structured example of a REST API with Echo:

```go
package main

import (
	"net/http"
	
	"github.com/labstack/echo/v4"
	"github.com/labstack/echo/v4/middleware"
)

// User represents user data
type User struct {
	ID   string `json:"id"`
	Name string `json:"name"`
	Age  int    `json:"age"`
}

// Database mock
var users = map[string]User{
	"1": {ID: "1", Name: "John", Age: 30},
	"2": {ID: "2", Name: "Jane", Age: 25},
}

func main() {
	e := echo.New()
	
	// Middleware
	e.Use(middleware.Logger())
	e.Use(middleware.Recover())
	
	// Routes
	e.GET("/users", getAllUsers)
	e.GET("/users/:id", getUser)
	e.POST("/users", createUser)
	
	// Start server
	e.Logger.Fatal(e.Start(":8080"))
}

// Handler functions
func getAllUsers(c echo.Context) error {
	userList := []User{}
	for _, user := range users {
		userList = append(userList, user)
	}
	return c.JSON(http.StatusOK, userList)
}

func getUser(c echo.Context) error {
	id := c.Param("id")
	user, exists := users[id]
	if !exists {
		return c.JSON(http.StatusNotFound, map[string]string{
			"error": "User not found",
		})
	}
	return c.JSON(http.StatusOK, user)
}

func createUser(c echo.Context) error {
	user := new(User)
	if err := c.Bind(user); err != nil {
		return c.JSON(http.StatusBadRequest, map[string]string{
			"error": "Invalid data",
		})
	}
	
	// In a real app, you'd generate an ID and save to database
	user.ID = "3" // Just for demonstration
	users[user.ID] = *user
	
	return c.JSON(http.StatusCreated, user)
}
```

Now you can test your API using tools like curl, Postman, or any HTTP client:

- Get all users: `GET http://localhost:8080/users`
- Get a specific user: `GET http://localhost:8080/users/1`
- Create a user: `POST http://localhost:8080/users` with JSON body:
  ```json
  {
    "name": "Alice",
    "age": 28
  }
  ```

Happy coding with Echo!
