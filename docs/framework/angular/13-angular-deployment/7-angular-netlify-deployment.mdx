# Angular Netlify Deployment

## Introduction

Deploying your Angular application to a production environment is a crucial step in the development process. Netlify offers a straightforward, developer-friendly platform that makes deployment simple with features like continuous deployment, custom domains, and HTTPS by default.

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to deploy your Angular application to Netlify, configure the deployment settings, and set up continuous deployment from your Git repository.

## What is Netlify?

Netlify is a modern web hosting and automation platform that specializes in static site hosting and serverless functions. It offers:

- Continuous deployment directly from Git repositories
- Global CDN for fast content delivery
- Automatic HTTPS with Let's Encrypt
- Form handling, identity management, and serverless functions
- Branch-based previews for testing changes

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

1. An Angular project ready for deployment
2. A GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket account with your project code
3. A Netlify account (you can sign up for free at [netlify.com](https://www.netlify.com/))

## Preparing Your Angular Application for Netlify

### Step 1: Add a Netlify Configuration File

Create a file named `netlify.toml` in the root of your Angular project:

```toml
[build]
  publish = "dist/your-project-name"
  command = "ng build"

[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  to = "/index.html"
  status = 200
```

This configuration tells Netlify:
- How to build your application (`ng build`)
- Where to find the built files (`dist/your-project-name`)
- To redirect all routes to `index.html`, which is necessary for Angular's client-side routing

### Step 2: Ensure You Have a Production Build Configuration

Make sure your `angular.json` file has a proper production configuration:

```json
"configurations": {
  "production": {
    "fileReplacements": [
      {
        "replace": "src/environments/environment.ts",
        "with": "src/environments/environment.prod.ts"
      }
    ],
    "optimization": true,
    "outputHashing": "all",
    "sourceMap": false,
    "extractCss": true,
    "namedChunks": false,
    "aot": true,
    "extractLicenses": true,
    "vendorChunk": false,
    "buildOptimizer": true,
    "budgets": [
      {
        "type": "initial",
        "maximumWarning": "2mb",
        "maximumError": "5mb"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Deploying to Netlify

### Method 1: Connecting to Git Repository (Recommended)

This method enables continuous deployment - Netlify will automatically rebuild your site whenever you push changes to your repository.

1. **Login to Netlify**:
   
   Go to [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/) and log in with your account.

2. **Create a New Site**:

   Click on the "New site from Git" button.

3. **Connect to Your Git Provider**:

   Select your Git provider (GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket) and authorize Netlify to access your repositories.

4. **Select Your Repository**:

   Choose the repository containing your Angular project.

5. **Configure Build Settings**:

   Enter the following settings:
   - Build command: `ng build --prod` (or `npm run build` if you use npm scripts)
   - Publish directory: `dist/your-project-name` (replace with your actual project name)

6. **Deploy the Site**:

   Click "Deploy site" to start the deployment process.

### Method 2: Manual Deployment

If you prefer to deploy manually or want to test a specific build:

1. **Build Your Angular Application**:

   Run the build command locally:

   ```bash
   ng build --prod
   ```

2. **Deploy via Netlify UI**:

   - Go to the Netlify dashboard
   - Drag and drop your `dist/your-project-name` folder onto the designated area
   - Netlify will automatically detect and deploy your site

### Method 3: Using Netlify CLI

You can also use Netlify's command-line interface for deployments:

1. **Install Netlify CLI**:

   ```bash
   npm install -g netlify-cli
   ```

2. **Login to Netlify**:

   ```bash
   netlify login
   ```

3. **Initialize Netlify in Your Project**:

   ```bash
   netlify init
   ```

4. **Deploy to Netlify**:

   ```bash
   netlify deploy
   ```

   For production deployment:

   ```bash
   netlify deploy --prod
   ```

## Customizing Your Netlify Deployment

### Custom Domain Setup

1. In your Netlify dashboard, go to "Site settings" > "Domain management"
2. Click "Add custom domain"
3. Follow the instructions to set up DNS records with your domain provider

### Environment Variables

For configuration values that shouldn't be in your code:

1. Go to "Site settings" > "Build & deploy" > "Environment"
2. Add your variables (like API keys) that can be accessed via your Angular environment files

### Deploy Previews for Pull Requests

Netlify automatically creates preview deployments for pull requests, allowing you to test changes before merging:

1. Make sure your repository is connected to Netlify
2. Create a pull request in your Git repository
3. Netlify will comment on the PR with a link to the preview

## Real-World Example: Deploying an Angular Blog

Let's walk through deploying a simple Angular blog application to Netlify with continuous deployment from GitHub.

### 1. Project Structure

```
my-angular-blog/
├── src/
│   ├── app/
│   ├── assets/
│   ├── environments/
│   │   ├── environment.ts
│   │   └── environment.prod.ts
│   └── ...
├── angular.json
├── package.json
└── netlify.toml
```

### 2. Configure environment.prod.ts for Production Settings

```typescript
export const environment = {
  production: true,
  apiUrl: 'https://api.yourblog.com/v1'
};
```

### 3. Set Up netlify.toml

```toml
[build]
  publish = "dist/my-angular-blog"
  command = "ng build --configuration production"

[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  to = "/index.html"
  status = 200

[context.production.environment]
  ANGULAR_ENV = "production"

[context.deploy-preview.environment]
  ANGULAR_ENV = "staging"
```

### 4. Create a Build Script in package.json

```json
"scripts": {
  "start": "ng serve",
  "build": "ng build --configuration production",
  "deploy:netlify": "ng build --configuration production && netlify deploy --prod"
}
```

### 5. Connecting to GitHub and Deploying

1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Connect your repository to Netlify as described earlier
3. Configure build settings:
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Publish directory: `dist/my-angular-blog`
4. Deploy the site

### 6. Set Up Environment Variables

For our blog API key that shouldn't be in the code:

1. Go to Site settings > Environment variables
2. Add a variable: `API_KEY` with your secret key
3. Access it in your Angular application through a serverless function

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### 1. Routing Issues

**Problem**: 404 errors when refreshing pages with Angular routes

**Solution**: Ensure you have the correct redirect rule in your `netlify.toml`:

```toml
[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  to = "/index.html"
  status = 200
```

### 2. Build Failures

**Problem**: The build fails on Netlify but works locally

**Solution**:
- Check Netlify logs for specific errors
- Verify your Node.js version in a `.nvmrc` file:

```
14.17.0
```

### 3. Environment Variables Not Working

**Problem**: Your application can't access environment variables

**Solution**:
- Remember that environment variables are only available during build time
- Use Netlify functions for secrets that need to be accessed during runtime
