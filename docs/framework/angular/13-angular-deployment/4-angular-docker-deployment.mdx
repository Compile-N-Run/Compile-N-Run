# Angular Docker Deployment

## Introduction

Docker has revolutionized how applications are packaged and deployed by providing a consistent environment across development, testing, and production. For Angular applications, Docker offers significant advantages: it eliminates the "it works on my machine" problem, streamlines CI/CD pipelines, and makes scaling applications more manageable.

In this guide, we'll explore how to containerize an Angular application using Docker. We'll cover creating a Docker image, optimizing it for production, and deploying the containerized application.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have:

- Basic knowledge of Angular framework
- Angular CLI installed (`npm install -g @angular/cli`)
- Docker installed on your machine ([Get Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/))
- A working Angular application (or use a new one created with `ng new my-app`)

## Docker Basics for Angular

### What is Docker?

Docker is a platform that allows you to package applications and their dependencies into standardized units called containers. These containers are lightweight, isolated, and portable, making them perfect for deploying applications consistently across different environments.

### Why Containerize Angular Applications?

1. **Environment Consistency**: Same environment in development and production
2. **Isolation**: Application dependencies are isolated from the host system
3. **Simplified Deployments**: Streamlined deployments across different environments
4. **Scalability**: Easily scale applications in container orchestration platforms like Kubernetes

## Creating a Dockerfile for Angular

A Dockerfile contains instructions for building a Docker image. Let's create a basic Dockerfile for an Angular application:

```dockerfile
# Stage 1: Build the Angular application
FROM node:16 as build
WORKDIR /app
COPY package.json package-lock.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY . .
RUN npm run build -- --configuration production

# Stage 2: Serve the application with Nginx
FROM nginx:1.21
COPY --from=build /app/dist/my-angular-app /usr/share/nginx/html
COPY ./nginx.conf /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf
EXPOSE 80
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
```

This Dockerfile uses a multi-stage build process:
1. **Stage 1**: Uses Node.js to build the Angular application
2. **Stage 2**: Uses Nginx to serve the built application

### Creating the Nginx Configuration

Create a file named `nginx.conf` in your project root:

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name localhost;
    root /usr/share/nginx/html;
    index index.html;

    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
    }
}
```

This configuration is essential for Angular's client-side routing to work correctly.

## Building the Docker Image

To build the Docker image, navigate to your project directory and run:

```bash
docker build -t my-angular-app .
```

This command builds a Docker image with the tag `my-angular-app` using the instructions in the Dockerfile.

Output:
```
Sending build context to Docker daemon  24.58MB
Step 1/10 : FROM node:16 as build
 ---> b9f398d30e45
Step 2/10 : WORKDIR /app
 ---> Using cache
 ---> a7b298c4a1a2
...
Successfully built 7f3b5e7a9e0a
Successfully tagged my-angular-app:latest
```

## Running the Docker Container

After building the image, you can run it as a container:

```bash
docker run -p 8080:80 my-angular-app
```

This command maps port 8080 on your host to port 80 in the container. You can access your Angular application by navigating to `http://localhost:8080` in your browser.

## Optimizing the Docker Image for Production

The basic Dockerfile works, but we can optimize it further for production:

```dockerfile
# Stage 1: Build the Angular application
FROM node:16-alpine as build
WORKDIR /app

# Copy only package files first to leverage Docker cache
COPY package.json package-lock.json ./
RUN npm ci

# Copy the rest of the application and build it
COPY . .
RUN npm run build -- --configuration production

# Stage 2: Serve the application with Nginx
FROM nginx:1.21-alpine
COPY --from=build /app/dist/my-angular-app /usr/share/nginx/html

# Copy custom nginx config
COPY ./nginx.conf /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf

# Add health check
HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=3s CMD wget -q --spider http://localhost/ || exit 1

# Expose port 80
EXPOSE 80

CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
```

Key optimizations:
1. Using Alpine-based images to reduce size
2. Leveraging Docker's caching mechanism with package files
3. Using `npm ci` instead of `npm install` for more reliable builds
4. Adding a health check to monitor container health

## Docker Compose for Development

For development, you might want to use Docker Compose to manage your containers. Create a `docker-compose.yml` file:

```yaml
version: '3'

services:
  angular-app:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile.dev
    ports:
      - "4200:4200"
    volumes:
      - ./src:/app/src
      - ./package.json:/app/package.json
    command: npm start
```

And a development Dockerfile (`Dockerfile.dev`):

```dockerfile
FROM node:16-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY package.json package-lock.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY . .
EXPOSE 4200
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

Run it with:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

This setup mounts your source code as a volume, allowing you to make changes and see them immediately without rebuilding the image.

## Real-world Example: CI/CD Pipeline with Docker

Here's a practical example of how Docker fits into a CI/CD pipeline for an Angular application using GitHub Actions:

```yaml
name: Build and Deploy

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    
    - name: Build and push Docker image
      uses: docker/build-push-action@v2
      with:
        context: .
        push: true

        
  deploy:
    needs: build
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    steps:
    - name: Deploy to production
      uses: appleboy/ssh-action@master
      with:
        host: ${{ secrets.HOST }}
        username: ${{ secrets.USERNAME }}
        key: ${{ secrets.SSH_KEY }}
        script: |
          docker pull myregistry.com/my-angular-app:latest
          docker stop my-angular-app || true
          docker rm my-angular-app || true
          docker run -d --name my-angular-app -p 80:80 myregistry.com/my-angular-app:latest
```

This workflow:
1. Builds a Docker image of your Angular application
2. Pushes it to a Docker registry
3. Deploys it to a production server via SSH

## Deploying to Cloud Platforms

### Deploying to Azure App Service

```bash
# Login to Azure
az login

# Create a resource group
az group create --name myResourceGroup --location eastus

# Create an App Service plan
az appservice plan create --name myAppServicePlan --resource-group myResourceGroup --sku B1 --is-linux

# Create a web app
az webapp create --resource-group myResourceGroup --plan myAppServicePlan --name my-angular-app --deployment-container-image-name myregistry.com/my-angular-app:latest

# Configure the web app to use the container
az webapp config container set --name my-angular-app --resource-group myResourceGroup --docker-custom-image-name myregistry.com/my-angular-app:latest
```

### Deploying to AWS Elastic Container Service (ECS)

```bash
# Create an ECS cluster
aws ecs create-cluster --cluster-name angular-cluster

# Register a task definition (requires JSON file)
aws ecs register-task-definition --cli-input-json file://task-definition.json

# Create a service
aws ecs create-service --cluster angular-cluster --service-name angular-service --task-definition angular-task:1 --desired-count 1
```

## Common Issues and Troubleshooting

### Issue: Angular Routes Not Working

**Solution**: Ensure your Nginx configuration has the proper redirect for client-side routing:

```nginx
location / {
    try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
}
```

### Issue: Environment Variables in Angular

**Solution**: For Angular applications, environment variables need to be injected at build time or handled with a special approach at runtime:

```dockerfile
# Build-time environment variable
RUN npm run build -- --configuration production --env.API_URL=https://api.example.com
```

For runtime environment variables, create a script to replace placeholders in your built files:

```bash
#!/bin/sh
# env.sh
echo "Replacing environment variables..."
sed -i "s|API_URL_PLACEHOLDER|$API_URL|g" /usr/share/nginx/html/main.*.js
nginx -g "daemon off;"
```

Then update your Dockerfile:

```dockerfile
COPY ./env.sh /usr/local/bin/env.sh
RUN chmod +x /usr/local/bin/env.sh
CMD ["/usr/local/bin/env.sh"]
```

## Best Practices for Docker with Angular

1. **Use multi-stage builds** to keep final images small
2. **Leverage Docker cache** by organizing Dockerfile commands from least to most frequently changing
3. **Don't run containers as root** for better security
4. **Include only production dependencies** in your final image
5. **Use environment-specific configuration** for different environments
6. **Implement health checks** to monitor container health
7. **Use Docker Compose for local development** to simplify setup
