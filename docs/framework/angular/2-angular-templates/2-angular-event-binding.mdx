# Angular Event Binding

## Introduction

Event binding is a fundamental concept in Angular that allows your application to respond to user interactions such as clicks, keystrokes, mouse movements, and other DOM events. It serves as the bridge between user actions in the browser and your application code, enabling dynamic and interactive web applications.

In Angular, event binding uses a special syntax with parentheses `()` to connect events from DOM elements to methods in your component class. This creates a responsive user interface that can react to various user inputs in real-time.

## Basic Event Binding Syntax

The syntax for event binding in Angular is straightforward:

```html
<element (event)="statement"></element>
```

Where:
- `element` is any HTML element
- `event` is the name of the DOM event without the "on" prefix (e.g., `click` instead of "onclick")
- `statement` is the method or expression to execute when the event occurs

## Common Event Binding Examples

### Click Event

The most commonly used event binding is for handling clicks:

```html
<button (click)="onClick()">Click me</button>
```

In your component class:

```typescript
export class AppComponent {
  onClick() {
    console.log('Button was clicked!');
    // Perform any action here
  }
}
```

### Keyboard Events

Angular can easily capture keyboard events:

```html
<input (keyup)="onKeyUp($event)" placeholder="Type something">
<p>You typed: {{typedValue}}</p>
```

In your component:

```typescript
export class AppComponent {
  typedValue = '';
  
  onKeyUp(event: KeyboardEvent) {
    this.typedValue = (event.target as HTMLInputElement).value;
  }
}
```

### Mouse Events

You can respond to various mouse events:

```html
<div 
  (mouseenter)="onMouseEnter()" 
  (mouseleave)="onMouseLeave()"
  [style.background-color]="divColor"
  style="width: 200px; height: 200px; border: 1px solid black;">
  Hover over me!
</div>
```

In your component:

```typescript
export class AppComponent {
  divColor = 'white';
  
  onMouseEnter() {
    this.divColor = 'lightblue';
  }
  
  onMouseLeave() {
    this.divColor = 'white';
  }
}
```

## Passing Data with Events

### Using $event

The `$event` object contains information about the event that occurred. Its properties depend on the type of event:

```html
<input (input)="handleInput($event)" placeholder="Type here">
```

In your component:

```typescript
export class AppComponent {
  handleInput(event: any) {
    console.log('Input value:', event.target.value);
    console.log('Event type:', event.type);
  }
}
```

### Custom Parameters

You can also pass custom parameters along with the event:

```html
<button (click)="greet('John')">Greet John</button>
<button (click)="greet('Mary')">Greet Mary</button>
```

In your component:

```typescript
export class AppComponent {
  greet(name: string) {
    alert(`Hello, ${name}!`);
  }
}
```

## Event Filtering

Sometimes you may want to respond only to specific key presses or event conditions:

```html
<input (keyup.enter)="onEnterPressed()" placeholder="Press Enter">
```

In your component:

```typescript
export class AppComponent {
  onEnterPressed() {
    alert('You pressed the Enter key!');
  }
}
```

Common key event filters include:
- `keyup.enter` - Enter key
- `keyup.escape` - Escape key
- `keyup.space` - Space key
- `keyup.arrowup` - Up arrow key

## Practical Example: Simple Form Submission

Let's create a more comprehensive example with a form:

```html
<form (submit)="onSubmit($event)">
  <div>
    <label for="username">Username:</label>
    <input 
      id="username"
      type="text" 
      (input)="updateUsername($event)"
      [value]="username">
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <label for="comment">Comment:</label>
    <textarea 
      id="comment"
      (input)="updateComment($event)"
      [value]="comment"></textarea>
  </div>
  
  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>

<div *ngIf="submitted">
  <h3>Your Submission:</h3>
  <p><strong>Username:</strong> {{username}}</p>
  <p><strong>Comment:</strong> {{comment}}</p>
</div>
```

In your component:

```typescript
export class AppComponent {
  username = '';
  comment = '';
  submitted = false;
  
  updateUsername(event: any) {
    this.username = event.target.value;
  }
  
  updateComment(event: any) {
    this.comment = event.target.value;
  }
  
  onSubmit(event: Event) {
    event.preventDefault(); // Prevent browser from submitting the form
    this.submitted = true;
    console.log('Form submitted with:', {
      username: this.username,
      comment: this.comment
    });
  }
}
```

## Real-world Application: Todo List

Here's a practical example of a simple todo list application using event binding:

```html
<div class="todo-app">
  <h2>Todo List</h2>
  
  <div class="add-todo">
    <input 
      #newTodo
      (keyup.enter)="addTodo(newTodo.value); newTodo.value=''" 
      placeholder="Add a new task">
    <button (click)="addTodo(newTodo.value); newTodo.value=''">Add</button>
  </div>
  
  <ul class="todo-list">
    <li *ngFor="let todo of todos; let i = index">
      <span 
        [style.text-decoration]="todo.completed ? 'line-through' : 'none'"
        (click)="toggleComplete(i)">
        {{ todo.text }}
      </span>
      <button (click)="deleteTodo(i)">Delete</button>
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <div class="todo-summary" *ngIf="todos.length > 0">
    <p>{{ completedCount }} of {{ todos.length }} tasks completed</p>
  </div>
</div>
```

In your component:

```typescript
interface Todo {
  text: string;
  completed: boolean;
}

export class AppComponent {
  todos: Todo[] = [
    { text: 'Learn Angular', completed: false },
    { text: 'Build a todo app', completed: false }
  ];
  
  get completedCount() {
    return this.todos.filter(todo => todo.completed).length;
  }
  
  addTodo(text: string) {
    if (text.trim()) {
      this.todos.push({ text: text.trim(), completed: false });
    }
  }
  
  toggleComplete(index: number) {
    this.todos[index].completed = !this.todos[index].completed;
  }
  
  deleteTodo(index: number) {
    this.todos.splice(index, 1);
  }
}
```

## Best Practices for Event Binding

1. **Keep template expressions simple**: Large expressions in your templates make your code harder to read and maintain. Move complex logic to component methods.

2. **Debounce frequent events**: For events that fire rapidly (like `mousemove`), consider using techniques like RxJS debouncing to limit how often your code runs.

3. **Clean up event listeners**: When using global event listeners (like `window.resize`), make sure to clean them up when the component is destroyed to prevent memory leaks.

4. **Use appropriate event names**: Use the DOM event name without the 'on' prefix (e.g., `click`, not `onclick`).

5. **Use event filtering**: Take advantage of Angular's event filtering like `keyup.enter` instead of manually checking event properties.

## Common Event Types

Here are some commonly used DOM events in Angular applications:

| Event         | Description                                 |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------|
| `click`       | Element was clicked                         |
| `dblclick`    | Element was double-clicked                  |
| `mouseenter`  | Mouse pointer enters an element             |
| `mouseleave`  | Mouse pointer leaves an element             |
| `keyup`       | Key was released                            |
| `keydown`     | Key was pressed                             |
| `input`       | Input value changes                         |
| `change`      | Element value changes (on blur)             |
| `submit`      | Form was submitted                          |
| `focus`       | Element received focus                      |
| `blur`        | Element lost focus                          |
| `scroll`      | Element was scrolled                        |

## Summary

Event binding is a powerful feature in Angular that enables your application to respond to user interactions. By using the simple `(event)="handler()"` syntax, you can create interactive and responsive user interfaces.

Key points to remember:
- Use parentheses `()` for event binding
- The event name is written without the "on" prefix
- You can access event data using the `$event` parameter
- Event filtering lets you respond to specific key or event conditions

By mastering event binding, you'll be able to create rich, interactive Angular applications that respond to user actions in real-time.
