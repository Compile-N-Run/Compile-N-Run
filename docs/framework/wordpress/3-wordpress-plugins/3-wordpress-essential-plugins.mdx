- They extend WordPress core capabilities
- They solve specific problems without coding
- They save time and development costs
- They allow customization based on your unique needs

                'value' => 'product',
            ],
        ],
    ],
];

// Display custom fields in a template
$price = get_field('price');
echo '<p class="price">$' . $price . '</p>';

if (have_rows('features')) {
    echo '<ul class="features">';
    while (have_rows('features')) {

## Plugin Management Best Practices

When working with WordPress plugins, follow these important guidelines:

1. **Minimize Plugin Count**: Only install what you truly need
2. **Update Regularly**: Keep plugins updated for security and performance
3. **Check Compatibility**: Ensure plugins work with your WordPress version
4. **Review Plugin Quality**:
   - Look for recent updates
   - Check ratings and reviews
   - Verify support responsiveness
   - Examine documentation quality
5. **Test Before Production**: Always test new plugins on a staging site first

## Common Plugin Issues and Solutions

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Plugin conflicts | Deactivate all plugins and reactivate one by one to identify conflicts |
| Performance slowdowns | Use a performance analysis tool like Query Monitor to identify slow plugins |
| Security vulnerabilities | Keep plugins updated and remove unused ones |
| Database bloat | Use plugins like WP-Optimize to clean up your database |
