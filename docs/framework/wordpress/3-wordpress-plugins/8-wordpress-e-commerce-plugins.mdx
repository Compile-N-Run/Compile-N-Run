## Popular WordPress E-commerce Plugins

### 1. WooCommerce

WooCommerce is the most popular e-commerce plugin for WordPress, powering approximately 30% of all online stores worldwide. Owned by Automattic (the company behind WordPress.com), it offers robust functionality while maintaining the flexibility WordPress is known for.

3. **Adding Your First Product**:

Navigate to **Products > Add New** and you'll see a familiar WordPress editor with additional product data fields:

```

4. **Configuring Payment Gateways**:

// WooCommerce comes with several payment gateways pre-installed
// Navigate to: WooCommerce > Settings > Payments

// Available by default:

```

## Extending Your E-commerce Store

Once you have the basic store functioning, you might want to add these common extensions:

### Analytics and Reporting

```php
// WooCommerce includes basic reports, but for advanced analytics:
// Install WooCommerce Google Analytics integration
wp plugin install woocommerce-google-analytics-integration --activate

// Configure with your Google Analytics tracking ID
$tracking_options = array(
    'ga_id' => 'UA-XXXXXXXX-X',
    'enable_standard_tracking' => true,
    'enable_enhanced_ecommerce' => true,
    'anonymize_ip' => true
);
```

### Email Marketing Integration

Many e-commerce stores benefit from email marketing integrations to follow up with customers and increase sales:

```php
// Example: Connecting WooCommerce to Mailchimp
wp plugin install mailchimp-for-woocommerce --activate

// Configuration settings
$mailchimp_settings = array(
    'api_key' => 'your-mailchimp-api-key',
    'store_name' => 'Your Store Name',
    'store_prefix' => 'your_store',
    'list_id' => 'your-audience-id',
    'enable_opt_in' => true
);
```

## Optimizing Your E-commerce Store

### Performance Optimization

E-commerce sites can become slow due to product images and database queries. Here are some tips:

1. **Image Optimization**:

```php
// Install an image optimization plugin
wp plugin install imagify --activate

// Or optimize with WP-CLI
wp media regenerate --yes
```

2. **Caching**:

```php
// Install a caching plugin compatible with e-commerce
wp plugin install wp-rocket --activate

// Configure to exclude cart, checkout, and account pages from cache
$excluded_pages = array(
    '/cart/',
    '/checkout/',
    '/my-account/'
);
```

### Security Measures

E-commerce sites handle sensitive data and need extra security:

```php
// Install a security plugin
wp plugin install wordfence --activate

// Enable SSL (HTTPS) for your site
// Add to wp-config.php:
define('FORCE_SSL_ADMIN', true);

// Using WP-CLI to search/replace HTTP with HTTPS URLs in the database
wp search-replace 'http://yoursite.com' 'https://yoursite.com' --all-tables
```

## Practical Example: Setting Up a Complete WooCommerce Store

Let's walk through a practical example of setting up a t-shirt store with WooCommerce:

### 1. Initial Setup

```php
// After installing WooCommerce and completing the setup wizard:
// Configure business information
$store_info = array(
    'address' => '123 Main Street',
    'city' => 'Anytown',
    'state' => 'CA',
    'zip' => '12345',
    'country' => 'US'
);

// Set up tax rules
$tax_settings = array(
    'enable_taxes' => true,
    'prices_include_tax' => false,
    'tax_based_on' => 'shipping', // Options: 'shipping', 'billing', or 'base'
    'shipping_tax_class' => 'standard'
);

// Configure shipping zones
$shipping_zones = array(
    array(
        'name' => 'United States',
        'regions' => array('US'),
        'methods' => array(
            'flat_rate' => array(
                'cost' => '5.99',
                'title' => 'Standard Shipping (3-5 days)'
            ),
            'free_shipping' => array(
                'requires' => 'min_amount',
                'min_amount' => '50.00'
            )
        )
    ),
    array(
        'name' => 'International',
        'regions' => array('rest_of_world'),
        'methods' => array(
            'flat_rate' => array(
                'cost' => '15.99',
                'title' => 'International Shipping (7-14 days)'
            )
        )
    )
);
```

### 2. Creating Product Categories

```php
// Create logical category structure
$categories = array(
    'Men' => array(
        'T-Shirts',
        'Hoodies',
        'Accessories'
    ),
    'Women' => array(
        'T-Shirts',
        'Tank Tops',
        'Accessories'
    ),
    'Collections' => array(
        'Summer',
        'Vintage',
        'Graphic'
    )
);

// In the WordPress dashboard:
// Products > Categories
```

### 3. Adding Variable Products (T-shirts with different sizes and colors)

```php
// Create global attributes first
// Products > Attributes > Add new
$attributes = array(
    'Size' => array('S', 'M', 'L', 'XL'),
    'Color' => array('Black', 'White', 'Blue', 'Red')
);

// Then create a variable product
// Products > Add New
$tshirt_product = array(
    'name' => 'Classic Logo T-Shirt',
    'type' => 'variable', // Important!
    'description' => 'Our bestselling t-shirt with the classic company logo...',
    'regular_price' => '', // Prices set at variation level
    'attributes' => array(
        'size' => array(
            'name' => 'Size',
            'options' => array('S', 'M', 'L', 'XL'),
            'visible' => true,
            'variation' => true
        ),
        'color' => array(
            'name' => 'Color',
            'options' => array('Black', 'White', 'Red'),
            'visible' => true,
            'variation' => true
        )
    ),
    'variations' => array(
        array(
            'attributes' => array(
                'size' => 'S',
                'color' => 'Black'
            ),
            'regular_price' => '19.99',
            'stock_quantity' => 10
        ),
        array(
            'attributes' => array(
                'size' => 'M',
                'color' => 'Black'
            ),
            'regular_price' => '19.99',
            'stock_quantity' => 15
        ),
        // And so on for all combinations...
    )
);
```

### 4. Setting Up the Store Pages

WooCommerce creates several essential pages automatically:

- Shop (product listing)
- Cart
- Checkout
- My Account

You may want to customize these pages or add additional content:

```php
// Add a shortcode to display featured products on the homepage
add_shortcode('featured_products', function($atts) {
    $atts = shortcode_atts(array(
        'per_page' => '4',
        'columns' => '4',
    ), $atts);
    
    return do_shortcode('[products featured="true" limit="' . $atts['per_page'] . '" columns="' . $atts['columns'] . '"]');
});

// Usage on any page:
// [featured_products per_page="3" columns="3"]
```

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

Even with the best setup, you might encounter these common e-commerce issues:

### 1. Payment Gateway Errors

```php
// Enable logging for payment gateways
// WooCommerce > Settings > Advanced > Logging
// Check logs at WooCommerce > Status > Logs

// Common fix for PayPal issues - force TLS v1.2
add_filter('https_ssl_verify', '__return_true');
add_filter('https_local_ssl_verify', '__return_true');
```

### 2. Inventory Management Issues

```php
// Check for products with inconsistent stock status
$query = new WP_Query(array(
    'post_type' => 'product',
    'posts_per_page' => -1,
    'meta_query' => array(
        'relation' => 'AND',
        array(
            'key' => '_manage_stock',
            'value' => 'yes'
        ),
        array(
            'key' => '_stock',
            'value' => '0',
            'compare' => '<=',
            'type' => 'NUMERIC'
        ),
        array(
            'key' => '_stock_status',
            'value' => 'instock'
        )
    )
));

// These products have zero or negative stock but are marked as in stock
```
