## Product-Based WordPress Business Models

### 1. WordPress Theme Development

Themes are the visual foundation of WordPress websites, controlling how content looks and is displayed to visitors.

#### Business Model:

- **Revenue Streams**: One-time sales, annual subscriptions, lifetime access
- **Target Market**: Website owners, designers, developers, agencies
- **Pricing Range**: $39-$249 per theme or $99-$299 for theme collections/yearly access
- **Distribution**: Your own website, ThemeForest, WordPress.org (free themes with upsell)

#### Getting Started:

1. Learn theme development fundamentals
2. Study successful theme businesses (Elegant Themes, StudioPress, Astra)
3. Identify a niche or unique selling proposition
4. Create a high-quality theme with comprehensive documentation
5. Set up marketing and distribution channels

#### Code Example: Basic Theme Structure

```php
// Theme's functions.php file
function mytheme_setup() {
    // Add theme support

    add_theme_support('custom-logo', array(
        'height'      => 100,

        'footer'  => __('Footer Menu', 'mytheme'),
    ));
}
add_action('after_setup_theme', 'mytheme_setup');

// Enqueue styles and scripts
function mytheme_scripts() {
    wp_enqueue_style('mytheme-style', get_stylesheet_uri());

}
add_action('wp_enqueue_scripts', 'mytheme_scripts');

// Define plugin constants
define('MY_PLUGIN_VERSION', '1.0.0');
define('MY_PLUGIN_PATH', plugin_dir_path(__FILE__));

// Activation and deactivation hooks
function activate_my_plugin() {
    // Code to run on plugin activation
}

function deactivate_my_plugin() {
    // Code to run on plugin deactivation
}

register_activation_hook(__FILE__, 'activate_my_plugin');
register_deactivation_hook(__FILE__, 'deactivate_my_plugin');
