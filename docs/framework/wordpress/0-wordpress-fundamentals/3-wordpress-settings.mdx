  require_name_email: true,
  comment_max_links: 2,
  moderation_keys: 'casino, loan, viagra, pharmacy, free offer, limited time, weight loss'
});

// Install and configure anti-spam plugin
installPlugin('akismet');
configureAkismet({
  api_key: 'your-api-key',
  strictness: 'aggressive',
  discard_worst_spam: true
});
```

## Media Settings

Media Settings control how WordPress handles images and other media files.

### Navigating to Media Settings

```
Dashboard → Settings → Media
```

### Key Media Settings Options

| Setting | Description | Recommended Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Image sizes | Default dimensions for thumbnails, medium and large images | Thumbnail: 150×150<br />Medium: 300×300<br />Large: 1024×1024 |
| Uploading Files | Organize uploads into month/year folders | Checked (helps organize media library) |

### Setting Optimal Image Sizes

```jsx
// Configure optimal image sizes for a responsive theme
updateMediaSettings({
  thumbnail_size_w: 150,
  thumbnail_size_h: 150,
  thumbnail_crop: 1,
  medium_size_w: 400,
  medium_size_h: 400,
  large_size_w: 1200,
  large_size_h: 1200,
  organize_uploads: 'yes'
});

// Adding custom image sizes (using functions.php)
// This would go in your theme's functions.php file
add_image_size('featured-header', 1600, 500, true);
add_image_size('square-medium', 600, 600, true);
add_image_size('blog-thumbnail', 400, 300, true);
```

## Permalink Settings

Permalink Settings determine the URL structure of your posts and pages.

### Navigating to Permalink Settings

```
Dashboard → Settings → Permalinks
```

### Permalink Structure Options

| Structure | Example | Best Use Case |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Plain | `?p=123` | Rarely recommended |
| Day and name | `/2023/05/20/sample-post/` | News sites |
| Month and name | `/2023/05/sample-post/` | Blogs with frequent posts |
| Numeric | `/archives/123` | Rarely recommended |
| Post name | `/sample-post/` | Most websites (SEO-friendly) |
| Custom Structure | Custom format | Advanced needs |

### SEO-Friendly Permalink Setup

For most websites, the "Post name" option provides the most SEO benefits:

```jsx
// Configure SEO-friendly permalinks
updatePermalinkSettings({
  structure: '/%postname%/',
  category_base: 'topics', // Optional: customize category URLs
  tag_base: 'tags'        // Optional: customize tag URLs
});
```

This creates URLs like:
- `https://yoursite.com/your-post-title/`
- `https://yoursite.com/topics/your-category/`
- `https://yoursite.com/tags/your-tag/`

### Understanding Permalink Tags

WordPress provides several tags you can use in custom permalink structures:

| Tag | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `%year%` | The year of the post (4 digits) |
| `%monthnum%` | Month of the year (2 digits) |
| `%day%` | Day of the month (2 digits) |
| `%hour%` | Hour of the day (2 digits) |
| `%minute%` | Minute of the hour (2 digits) |
| `%second%` | Second of the minute (2 digits) |
| `%postname%` | URL-friendly version of the post title |
| `%post_id%` | The unique ID of the post |
| `%category%` | URL-friendly version of the category name |
| `%author%` | URL-friendly version of the author name |
