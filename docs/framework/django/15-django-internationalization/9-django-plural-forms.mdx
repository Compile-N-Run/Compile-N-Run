# Django Plural Forms

## Introduction

When creating multilingual applications in Django, one of the most challenging aspects is handling plural forms correctly. Different languages have different rules for pluralization, and Django provides a powerful system to handle this complexity.

In English, we typically have two forms: singular (1 item) and plural (0, 2, or more items). However, many languages have more complex rules. For example:

- Arabic has six different plural forms
- Russian has three forms
- Japanese has only one form

Django's internationalization framework allows you to handle these variations elegantly through its plural forms system.

## Understanding Plural Forms in Django

Django uses the gettext standard for internationalization. When dealing with plurals, we use the `ngettext()` function in our Python code and the `{% blocktranslate count %}` template tag in our templates.

### The Problem with Simple Translation

Consider a simple message like "You have X messages". A naive translation approach might look like:

```python
# DON'T DO THIS
message = _("You have %d messages") % count
```

This approach works poorly because:

1. In English, "You have 1 messages" is grammatically incorrect
2. Other languages may have completely different plural rules

## Using Plural Forms in Python Code

In Python code, we use the `ngettext()` function to handle plural forms:

```python
from django.utils.translation import ngettext

def inbox_message(count):
    return ngettext(
        "You have %(count)d message",       # singular
        "You have %(count)d messages",      # plural
        count                               # number for determining form
    ) % {'count': count}
```

### Example Output:

```
count = 0: "You have 0 messages"
count = 1: "You have 1 message"
count = 2: "You have 2 messages"
```

When this text is extracted for translation, translators will provide appropriate plural forms according to their language's rules.

## Using Plural Forms in Django Templates

In Django templates, we use the `{% blocktranslate %}` tag with the `count` parameter:

```django
{% load i18n %}

{% blocktranslate count counter=list|length %}
There is {{ counter }} item in your list.
{% plural %}
There are {{ counter }} items in your list.
{% endblocktranslate %}
```

The template system automatically selects the appropriate plural form based on the value of `counter`.

## Real-world Example: A Comments System

Let's see a more comprehensive example with a comments system:

```python
# models.py
class Article(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    content = models.TextField()
    
    def comment_count_message(self):
        count = self.comment_set.count()
        return ngettext(
            "This article has %(count)d comment.",
            "This article has %(count)d comments.",
            count
        ) % {'count': count}
```

```django
<!-- article_detail.html -->
{% load i18n %}

<h1>{{ article.title }}</h1>
<div class="content">{{ article.content }}</div>

<div class="comments-header">
    {% blocktranslate count counter=article.comment_set.count %}
    This article has {{ counter }} comment. Join the discussion!
    {% plural %}
    This article has {{ counter }} comments. Join the discussion!
    {% endblocktranslate %}
</div>

{% for comment in comments %}
    <!-- Display comments -->
{% endfor %}

{% blocktranslate count remaining=remaining_count %}
    And {{ remaining }} more comment...
{% plural %}
    And {{ remaining }} more comments...
{% endblocktranslate %}
```

## How Django Handles Complex Plural Rules

Behind the scenes, Django's translation files contain plural form expressions that define how many plural forms a language has and which form to use for a given number.

Here's an example header from a `.po` file for Polish language:

```
Plural-Forms: nplurals=4; plural=(n==1 ? 0 : (n%10>=2 && n%10<=4) && (n%100<12 || n%100>14) ? 1 : n!=1 && (n%10>=0 && n%10<=1) || (n%10>=5 && n%10<=9) || (n%100>=12 && n%100<=14) ? 2 : 3);
```

This complex expression defines Polish's four plural forms and when to use each one. Fortunately, you don't need to write these expressions yourself - Django takes care of this through the translation system.

## Handling Variables in Plural Forms

When your message includes multiple variables but only one determines the plural form, you can specify which one to use:

```django
{% blocktranslate count count=users|length %}
{{ count }} user has selected {{ product }}
{% plural %}
{{ count }} users have selected {{ product }}
{% endblocktranslate %}
```

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Concatenating strings**: Never build sentences by concatenating translated parts:

```python
# DON'T DO THIS
message = _("You have") + " " + str(count) + " " + _("messages")
```

2. **Forgetting context**: Sometimes the same word has different pluralization depending on context. Use context markers when needed:

```python
# Different contexts for the word "minutes"
ngettext_lazy("%(count)d minute", "%(count)d minutes", count)  # time context
ngettext_lazy("%(count)d minute of meeting", "%(count)d minutes of meeting", count)  # meeting context
```

3. **Hardcoding English pluralization rules**: Avoid assumptions about when to use plural forms based on English rules.

## Best Practices

1. Always use `ngettext()` when dealing with countable items
2. Keep the entire sentence in the translation string, not just parts
3. Use named placeholders (`%(count)d`) instead of positional ones (`%d`) for clarity
4. Provide context when the same message could be translated differently depending on context

## Summary

Django's plural forms system is a powerful feature that helps you create truly internationalized applications:

- Use `ngettext()` in Python code and `{% blocktranslate count %}` in templates
- Let the translation system handle the complexity of different language rules
- Provide singular and plural forms in English, and translators will provide the appropriate forms for their languages
- Avoid making assumptions based on English pluralization rules

By following these practices, your Django applications will be linguistically correct across different languages, providing a better experience for users worldwide.

## Practice Exercises

1. Create a simple Django view that displays different messages based on how many items are in a shopping cart
2. Implement a blog application that correctly pluralizes comments, posts, and likes
3. Try adding translations for a language with complex plural rules (like Arabic or Russian) to understand how Django handles them
