# Django Mock Objects

When building applications with Django, you'll often have components that depend on external services, databases, or other parts of your application. Testing these components can be challenging, as you may not want your tests to actually interact with these external dependencies. This is where **mock objects** come into play.

## What Are Mock Objects?

Mock objects are simulated objects that mimic the behavior of real objects in controlled ways. In testing, mocks allow you to:

- Replace real dependencies with fake versions
- Control the behavior of dependencies
- Verify how your code interacts with its dependencies
- Test code in isolation from external systems

Django testing uses Python's `unittest.mock` library, which provides powerful tools for creating mock objects.

## Why Use Mocks in Django Testing?

There are several key reasons to use mocks in your Django tests:

1. **Speed**: Tests that use mocks instead of real databases or API calls run much faster.
2. **Isolation**: You can test a component without worrying about bugs in other components.
3. **Predictability**: Tests with mocks are more reliable since they don't depend on external state.
4. **Control**: You can simulate edge cases and error conditions that would be difficult to create with real dependencies.

## Getting Started with Mock Objects

### Basic Mocking with `unittest.mock`

Let's start with a simple example. Imagine we have a service that sends emails:

```python
# myapp/services.py
class EmailService:
    def send_welcome_email(self, user):
        # Complex logic to send an actual email
        print(f"Sending welcome email to {user.email}")
        # Connect to SMTP server, send email, etc.
        return True
```

And a user registration function that uses this service:

```python
# myapp/views.py
from .services import EmailService

def register_user(user_data):
    # Create user in database
    user = User.objects.create_user(
        username=user_data['username'],
        email=user_data['email'],
        password=user_data['password']
    )
    
    # Send welcome email
    email_service = EmailService()
    email_service.send_welcome_email(user)
    
    return user
```

To test the `register_user` function without actually sending emails, we can mock the `EmailService`:

```python
# myapp/tests.py
from django.test import TestCase
from django.contrib.auth.models import User
from unittest.mock import patch
from .views import register_user

class UserRegistrationTest(TestCase):
    @patch('myapp.views.EmailService')
    def test_register_user(self, mock_email_service):
        # Setup the mock
        mock_instance = mock_email_service.return_value
        mock_instance.send_welcome_email.return_value = True
        
        # Call the function under test
        user_data = {
            'username': 'testuser',
            'email': 'test@example.com',
            'password': 'password123'
        }
        user = register_user(user_data)
        
        # Assert that the user was created
        self.assertEqual(user.username, 'testuser')
        self.assertEqual(user.email, 'test@example.com')
        
        # Assert that send_welcome_email was called
        mock_instance.send_welcome_email.assert_called_once_with(user)
```

In this example, we're using the `@patch` decorator to replace the `EmailService` class with a mock. We then verify that the `send_welcome_email` method was called with the correct arguments.

## Mock Techniques in Django

### Mocking Models and Querysets

Django models and querysets can be tricky to mock. Here's an approach using `MagicMock`:

```python
# Function to test
def get_active_users():
    return User.objects.filter(is_active=True)

# Test with mock
from unittest.mock import patch, MagicMock

@patch('myapp.views.User.objects')
def test_get_active_users(mock_user_objects):
    # Create a mock queryset
    mock_queryset = MagicMock()
    mock_user_objects.filter.return_value = mock_queryset
    
    # Call the function
    result = get_active_users()
    
    # Assertions
    mock_user_objects.filter.assert_called_once_with(is_active=True)
    self.assertEqual(result, mock_queryset)
```

### Mocking HTTP Requests

When your Django application makes HTTP requests to external APIs, you can use the `requests-mock` package:

```python
# Install with: pip install requests-mock

# Function that makes an API call
import requests

def get_weather_data(city):
    response = requests.get(f"https://api.weather.example/data?city={city}")
    if response.status_code == 200:
        return response.json()
    return None

# Test with mock
import requests_mock
from django.test import TestCase

class WeatherAPITest(TestCase):
    def test_get_weather_data(self):
        with requests_mock.Mocker() as m:
            # Mock the API response
            m.get('https://api.weather.example/data?city=Berlin', 
                  json={'temp': 20, 'condition': 'sunny'})
            
            # Call the function
            result = get_weather_data('Berlin')
            
            # Assertions
            self.assertEqual(result, {'temp': 20, 'condition': 'sunny'})
```

## Advanced Mocking Techniques

### Side Effect Functions

Sometimes you want your mock to do more than just return a value. You can use `side_effect` for more complex behavior:

```python
from unittest.mock import patch, MagicMock

@patch('myapp.services.external_api_call')
def test_with_side_effect(mock_api):
    # Define a side effect function
    def side_effect(arg):
        if arg == 'valid_input':
            return {'status': 'success', 'data': [1, 2, 3]}
        else:
            raise ValueError("Invalid input")
    
    # Assign the side effect
    mock_api.side_effect = side_effect
    
    # Now when the mocked function is called, it will execute the side_effect function
    # Test your function that uses external_api_call
```

### Mocking Class Methods

To mock a method of a specific class:

```python
from unittest.mock import patch
from django.test import TestCase
from myapp.models import Profile

class ProfileTest(TestCase):
    @patch.object(Profile, 'calculate_metrics')
    def test_profile_analytics(self, mock_calculate):
        # Setup the mock
        mock_calculate.return_value = {'views': 100, 'likes': 50}
        
        # Create a profile instance
        profile = Profile.objects.create(name='Test Profile')
        
        # Call the method that uses calculate_metrics
        metrics = profile.get_analytics()
        
        # Assertions
        mock_calculate.assert_called_once()
        self.assertEqual(metrics['views'], 100)
```

## Real-World Example: Testing a Django View

Let's put this all together in a realistic example. We'll test a Django view that processes a payment and sends a confirmation email:

```python
# myapp/views.py
from django.http import JsonResponse
from .services import PaymentService, EmailService
from .models import Order

def process_payment(request):
    order_id = request.POST.get('order_id')
    payment_method = request.POST.get('payment_method')
    amount = float(request.POST.get('amount'))
    
    order = Order.objects.get(id=order_id)
    payment_service = PaymentService()
    
    try:
        # Process the payment
        payment_result = payment_service.charge(payment_method, amount)
        
        if payment_result['success']:
            # Update order status
            order.status = 'paid'
            order.save()
            
            # Send confirmation email
            email_service = EmailService()
            email_service.send_payment_confirmation(order)
            
            return JsonResponse({
                'success': True,
                'order_id': order_id
            })
        else:
            return JsonResponse({
                'success': False,
                'error': payment_result['error']
            })
            
    except Exception as e:
        return JsonResponse({
            'success': False,
            'error': str(e)
        })
```

Now, let's test this view using mock objects:

```python
# myapp/tests.py
from django.test import TestCase, RequestFactory
from django.contrib.auth.models import User
from unittest.mock import patch, MagicMock
from .models import Order
from .views import process_payment

class PaymentViewTest(TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        # Create a test user
        self.user = User.objects.create_user(
            username='testuser',
            email='test@example.com',
            password='password123'
        )
        
        # Create a test order
        self.order = Order.objects.create(
            user=self.user,
            amount=99.99,
            status='pending'
        )
        
        # Setup request factory
        self.factory = RequestFactory()
    
    @patch('myapp.views.PaymentService')
    @patch('myapp.views.EmailService')
    def test_successful_payment(self, MockEmailService, MockPaymentService):
        # Configure payment service mock
        mock_payment_instance = MockPaymentService.return_value
        mock_payment_instance.charge.return_value = {'success': True}
        
        # Configure email service mock
        mock_email_instance = MockEmailService.return_value
        
        # Create request
        request = self.factory.post('/process-payment/', {
            'order_id': self.order.id,
            'payment_method': 'credit_card',
            'amount': '99.99'
        })
        
        # Call the view
        response = process_payment(request)
        
        # Assertions
        self.assertEqual(response.status_code, 200)
        
        # Parse JSON response
        response_data = response.json()
        self.assertEqual(response_data['success'], True)
        self.assertEqual(response_data['order_id'], self.order.id)
        
        # Verify payment service was called correctly
        mock_payment_instance.charge.assert_called_once_with('credit_card', 99.99)
        
        # Verify email service was called
        mock_email_instance.send_payment_confirmation.assert_called_once()
        
        # Verify order was updated in the database
        self.order.refresh_from_db()
        self.assertEqual(self.order.status, 'paid')
    
    @patch('myapp.views.PaymentService')
    @patch('myapp.views.EmailService')
    def test_failed_payment(self, MockEmailService, MockPaymentService):
        # Configure payment service mock to return failure
        mock_payment_instance = MockPaymentService.return_value
        mock_payment_instance.charge.return_value = {
            'success': False, 
            'error': 'Card declined'
        }
        
        # Create request
        request = self.factory.post('/process-payment/', {
            'order_id': self.order.id,
            'payment_method': 'credit_card',
            'amount': '99.99'
        })
        
        # Call the view
        response = process_payment(request)
        
        # Assertions
        self.assertEqual(response.status_code, 200)
        
        # Parse JSON response
        response_data = response.json()
        self.assertEqual(response_data['success'], False)
        self.assertEqual(response_data['error'], 'Card declined')
        
        # Verify payment service was called
        mock_payment_instance.charge.assert_called_once_with('credit_card', 99.99)
        
        # Verify email service was NOT called
        mock_email = MockEmailService.return_value
        mock_email.send_payment_confirmation.assert_not_called()
        
        # Verify order status was NOT updated
        self.order.refresh_from_db()
        self.assertEqual(self.order.status, 'pending')
```

## Best Practices for Using Mock Objects

1. **Don't over-mock**: Only mock what's necessary. Over-mocking can lead to tests that pass even when the actual code is broken.

2. **Mock at the right level**: Try to mock at the boundaries of your system, such as external APIs or services.

3. **Keep mocks simple**: The simpler your mocks, the easier your tests will be to understand and maintain.

4. **Use spec_set=True** when appropriate to prevent setting attributes that don't exist on the real object:

```python
mock_service = MagicMock(spec_set=EmailService)
```

5. **Reset mocks between tests**:

```python
def setUp(self):
    self.patcher = patch('myapp.services.EmailService')
    self.mock_email = self.patcher.start()
    
def tearDown(self):
    self.patcher.stop()
```

6. **Use autospec** for more accurate mocks that match the API of the mocked object:

```python
@patch('myapp.services.EmailService', autospec=True)
def test_something(self, mock_email_service):
    # mock_email_service will have the same API as EmailService
    pass
```

## Common Issues with Mocks

### 1. Mocking the wrong path

One common issue is patching the wrong import path:

```python
# This is in myapp/views.py
from .services import EmailService

# This won't work:
@patch('myapp.services.EmailService')  # Wrong!

# This will work:
@patch('myapp.views.EmailService')  # Correct! Patch where it's imported
```

Always patch where the object is *imported*, not where it's defined.

### 2. Testing implementation details

Mocking can lead to tests that are too coupled to implementation details:

```python
# Fragile test - breaks if implementation changes
@patch('myapp.views.EmailService')
def test_registration(self, mock_email):
    # Test implementation details
    
# Better approach
def test_registration(self):
    # Test the observable behavior (user created, no email sent)
    # Use integration tests for key flows
```

## Summary

Mock objects are a powerful tool in Django testing that allow you to isolate components, control dependencies, and test your code more thoroughly. By using the techniques described in this guide, you can write faster, more reliable, and more focused tests.

Remember these key points:
- Mocks help you test code in isolation
- Use `unittest.mock` or specialized packages like `requests-mock`
- Patch where objects are imported, not where they're defined
- Balance unit tests with mocks and integration tests for critical flows
- Follow good practices like using `spec_set` and `autospec`

## Exercises

1. Write a test for a function that sends a notification using both email and SMS services. Mock both services.

2. Create a Django view that fetches data from an external API and displays it. Write a test for this view using mocks.

3. Practice mocking Django's `User.objects.get()` method to return a specific user without accessing the database.

4. Write a test that verifies error handling in a function when a dependency raises an exception (use `side_effect`).

5. Refactor an existing test that uses actual API calls or database queries to use mocks instead, and compare the execution speed.
