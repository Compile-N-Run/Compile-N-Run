# Django Database Constraints

In any robust application, maintaining data integrity is crucial. Django provides several mechanisms to enforce data rules at the database level through constraints. These constraints ensure your data remains valid regardless of how it's manipulated.

## Introduction to Database Constraints

Database constraints are rules enforced at the database level to maintain the accuracy and reliability of the data. Unlike validation performed at the application level (using Django's form validation or model clean methods), database constraints are enforced by the database itself, ensuring data integrity even when data is modified outside of your Django application.

Django supports several types of database constraints:

- **Unique constraints**: Ensure uniqueness across one or more columns
- **Check constraints**: Validate that values meet specific conditions
- **Foreign key constraints**: Maintain referential integrity between tables
- **Index constraints**: Optimize queries and can enforce uniqueness

Let's explore each of these constraints and understand how to implement them in Django.

## Unique Constraints

Unique constraints ensure that values in specified columns or combinations of columns are unique across the table.

### Basic Unique Field

The simplest way to create a unique constraint is through the `unique=True` parameter in a model field:

```python
from django.db import models

class Product(models.Model):
    code = models.CharField(max_length=20, unique=True)
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    price = models.DecimalField(max_digits=10, decimal_places=2)
```

In this example, each product must have a unique code.

### Multi-Column Unique Constraints

For constraints that span multiple columns, use the `Meta.constraints` attribute with `UniqueConstraint`:

```python
from django.db import models
from django.db.models import UniqueConstraint

class Enrollment(models.Model):
    student = models.ForeignKey('Student', on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    course = models.ForeignKey('Course', on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    date_enrolled = models.DateField()
    
    class Meta:
        constraints = [
            UniqueConstraint(
                fields=['student', 'course'],
                name='unique_enrollment'
            )
        ]
```

This ensures a student can't be enrolled in the same course more than once.

### Conditional Unique Constraints

Django 3.1+ allows for conditional unique constraints:

```python
from django.db import models
from django.db.models import UniqueConstraint, Q

class Reservation(models.Model):
    room = models.ForeignKey('Room', on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    start_time = models.DateTimeField()
    end_time = models.DateTimeField()
    status = models.CharField(
        max_length=10,
        choices=[('confirmed', 'Confirmed'), ('cancelled', 'Cancelled')]
    )
    
    class Meta:
        constraints = [
            UniqueConstraint(
                fields=['room', 'start_time'],
                condition=Q(status='confirmed'),
                name='unique_room_reservation'
            )
        ]
```

This constraint ensures that a room can't have multiple confirmed reservations starting at the same time, but cancelled reservations don't count towards this constraint.

## Check Constraints

Check constraints allow you to specify conditions that values must meet to be inserted or updated.

```python
from django.db import models
from django.db.models import CheckConstraint, Q

class Product(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    price = models.DecimalField(max_digits=10, decimal_places=2)
    discount_price = models.DecimalField(max_digits=10, decimal_places=2, null=True, blank=True)
    
    class Meta:
        constraints = [
            CheckConstraint(
                check=Q(price__gt=0),
                name='price_positive'
            ),
            CheckConstraint(
                check=Q(discount_price__isnull=True) | Q(discount_price__lt=models.F('price')),
                name='discount_price_lt_price'
            )
        ]
```

These constraints ensure that:
1. Product price is always positive
2. If a discount price exists, it must be less than the regular price

## Foreign Key Constraints

Django automatically creates foreign key constraints when you define `ForeignKey` fields. These constraints ensure referential integrity.

```python
from django.db import models

class Author(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)

class Book(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    author = models.ForeignKey(
        Author, 
        on_delete=models.CASCADE
    )
```

The `on_delete` parameter specifies what happens when the referenced object is deleted:

- `CASCADE`: Delete the book if the author is deleted
- `PROTECT`: Prevent deletion of the author if they have books
- `SET_NULL`: Set the author to NULL (requires `null=True`)
- `SET_DEFAULT`: Set to the default author (requires `default`)
- `DO_NOTHING`: Do nothing (not recommended, can lead to database integrity issues)

## Index Constraints

Indexes optimize query performance and can also enforce uniqueness.

```python
from django.db import models
from django.db.models import Index

class Customer(models.Model):
    first_name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    last_name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    email = models.EmailField()
    
    class Meta:
        indexes = [
            Index(fields=['last_name', 'first_name']),
            Index(fields=['email'], name='email_idx')
        ]
```

This creates two indexes: one on the combination of last and first name, and another on the email field.

## Naming Conventions and Management

Good naming conventions for constraints make database management easier:

```python
class Meta:
    constraints = [
        UniqueConstraint(
            fields=['field1', 'field2'],
            name='app_model_constraint_type'  # e.g., 'store_product_unique_code'
        )
    ]
```

### Applying Constraints to Existing Projects

When adding constraints to existing projects, you need to create migrations:

```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
```

Review the migration file to ensure it correctly represents your intentions, then apply it:

```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

If your existing data violates new constraints, the migration will fail. You'll need to clean your data first or create a data migration.

## Real-World Example: E-commerce Inventory System

Let's see a comprehensive example of constraints in a simple inventory system:

```python
from django.db import models
from django.db.models import UniqueConstraint, CheckConstraint, Q, F

class Category(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100, unique=True)
    parent = models.ForeignKey('self', on_delete=models.CASCADE, null=True, blank=True)
    
    class Meta:
        constraints = [
            CheckConstraint(
                check=~Q(pk=F('parent')),
                name='category_prevent_self_reference'
            )
        ]

class Product(models.Model):
    sku = models.CharField(max_length=20, unique=True)
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    category = models.ForeignKey(Category, on_delete=models.PROTECT)
    price = models.DecimalField(max_digits=10, decimal_places=2)
    cost = models.DecimalField(max_digits=10, decimal_places=2)
    
    class Meta:
        constraints = [
            CheckConstraint(
                check=Q(price__gt=0),
                name='product_price_positive'
            ),
            CheckConstraint(
                check=Q(cost__gt=0),
                name='product_cost_positive'
            )
        ]

class Inventory(models.Model):
    product = models.ForeignKey(Product, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    warehouse = models.ForeignKey('Warehouse', on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    quantity = models.PositiveIntegerField(default=0)
    minimum_stock = models.PositiveIntegerField(default=0)
    
    class Meta:
        constraints = [
            UniqueConstraint(
                fields=['product', 'warehouse'],
                name='inventory_product_warehouse_unique'
            ),
            CheckConstraint(
                check=Q(minimum_stock__lte=1000),
                name='inventory_reasonable_min_stock'
            )
        ]

class Warehouse(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    location = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    is_active = models.BooleanField(default=True)
    
    class Meta:
        constraints = [
            UniqueConstraint(
                fields=['name'],
                condition=Q(is_active=True),
                name='warehouse_active_name_unique'
            )
        ]
```

This example demonstrates:
1. Preventing a category from being its own parent
2. Ensuring products have positive prices and costs
3. Enforcing unique product-warehouse combinations in inventory
4. Setting reasonable limits on minimum stock levels
5. Allowing inactive warehouses to have duplicate names, but requiring active warehouses to have unique names

## Performance Considerations

Database constraints add overhead to write operations but can improve data integrity. Here are some considerations:

- Constraints are checked on every insert/update operation
- Complex constraints may slow down write operations
- For very high-volume write operations, consider alternative strategies
- Database-level constraints are more reliable than application-level validation

## Summary

Django's database constraints provide powerful tools for maintaining data integrity at the database level. By using the various constraint types:

- **Unique constraints** prevent duplicate values
- **Check constraints** ensure values meet specific conditions  
- **Foreign key constraints** maintain relationships between tables
- **Index constraints** optimize queries and enforce uniqueness

Using constraints properly helps prevent data corruption, improves database design, and reduces the need for application-level validation.

## Exercises

1. Create a blog application with `User`, `Post`, and `Comment` models. Add constraints to ensure:
   - Users have unique email addresses
   - Post titles are unique for each user
   - Comments can't be empty

2. Implement a library management system with `Book`, `Member`, and `Loan` models. Add constraints to:
   - Prevent the same book from being checked out twice
   - Ensure return dates are after checkout dates
   - Limit members to a maximum of 5 active loans

3. Add a conditional constraint to an e-commerce system that ensures products marked as "featured" have at least one image.
