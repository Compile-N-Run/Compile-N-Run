# Java File Handling

## Introduction

File handling is a crucial part of Java programming and a foundational skill before diving into Spring Framework. In real-world applications, you'll frequently need to read configuration files, process data files, or store information persistently. Java provides robust APIs to interact with the file system, allowing you to create, read, write, and delete files.

In this tutorial, we'll explore Java's file handling capabilities, starting with the traditional approach using the `java.io` package and then moving to the more modern `java.nio.file` API introduced in Java 7. Understanding these concepts will prepare you for working with resource handling in Spring applications.

## Understanding Java's File Handling Architecture

Java offers multiple ways to work with files:

1. **Traditional I/O (`java.io`)**: The original file handling mechanism in Java
2. **New I/O (`java.nio` and `java.nio.file`)**: Introduced in Java 7 with improved performance and functionality
3. **Buffered Streams**: For efficient reading and writing of data

Let's start by understanding the basic concepts and classes.

## Basic File Operations with `java.io`

### Creating a File Object

The `File` class from the `java.io` package is the foundation for file operations in Java.

```java
import java.io.File;

public class FileDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Creating a file object
        File file = new File("demo.txt");
        
        // Check if file exists
        System.out.println("File exists: " + file.exists());
        
        // Get file information
        System.out.println("File name: " + file.getName());
        System.out.println("Absolute path: " + file.getAbsolutePath());
    }
}
```

**Output:**
```
File exists: false
File name: demo.txt
Absolute path: /your/current/directory/demo.txt
```

### Creating a New File

Let's see how to create a physical file on the file system:

```java
import java.io.File;
import java.io.IOException;

public class FileCreationDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Creating a file object
        File file = new File("newfile.txt");
        
        try {
            boolean created = file.createNewFile();
            if (created) {
                System.out.println("File created successfully!");
            } else {
                System.out.println("File already exists.");
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.out.println("An error occurred while creating the file.");
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

**Output (first run):**
```
File created successfully!
```

**Output (second run):**
```
File already exists.
```

## Writing to Files

Java provides several ways to write data to files. Let's explore some common approaches:

### Using `FileWriter`

`FileWriter` is a simple way to write characters to a file:

```java
import java.io.FileWriter;
import java.io.IOException;

public class FileWriteDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try (FileWriter writer = new FileWriter("output.txt")) {
            writer.write("Hello, Java File Handling!\n");
            writer.write("This is a simple example of writing to a file.");
            System.out.println("Content written to file successfully!");
        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.out.println("An error occurred while writing to the file.");
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

**Output:**
```
Content written to file successfully!
```

And the file `output.txt` will contain:
```
Hello, Java File Handling!
This is a simple example of writing to a file.
```

### Using `BufferedWriter` for Efficient Writing

For better performance, especially when writing large amounts of data, use `BufferedWriter`:

```java
import java.io.BufferedWriter;
import java.io.FileWriter;
import java.io.IOException;

public class BufferedWriteDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try (BufferedWriter writer = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter("buffered.txt"))) {
            writer.write("Using BufferedWriter for better performance");
            writer.newLine(); // Add a new line
            writer.write("Especially when writing large amounts of data");
            System.out.println("Content written using BufferedWriter!");
        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.out.println("An error occurred while writing to the file.");
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

## Reading from Files

Now let's look at how to read content from files.

### Using `FileReader` and `BufferedReader`

```java
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;

public class FileReadDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try (BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("output.txt"))) {
            String line;
            System.out.println("File content:");
            
            while ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) {
                System.out.println(line);
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.out.println("An error occurred while reading the file.");
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

**Output:**
```
File content:
Hello, Java File Handling!
This is a simple example of writing to a file.
```

## Modern File Handling with `java.nio.file`

Java 7 introduced the new `java.nio.file` package with the `Files` and `Paths` classes, offering more powerful file operations.

### Reading and Writing Files with `Files` Class

```java
import java.io.IOException;
import java.nio.file.Files;
import java.nio.file.Path;
import java.nio.file.Paths;
import java.nio.file.StandardOpenOption;
import java.util.List;

public class ModernFileHandlingDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Path path = Paths.get("modern.txt");
        
        try {
            // Writing to a file
            String content = "This is modern file handling using NIO.\nIt's more concise and powerful.";
            Files.write(path, content.getBytes(), StandardOpenOption.CREATE);
            
            System.out.println("File written successfully!");
            
            // Reading all lines from a file
            List<String> lines = Files.readAllLines(path);
            System.out.println("\nFile content:");
            for (String line : lines) {
                System.out.println(line);
            }
            
        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.out.println("An error occurred.");
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

**Output:**
```
File written successfully!

File content:
This is modern file handling using NIO.
It's more concise and powerful.
```

## Working with Binary Files

Sometimes you need to work with binary files like images or PDF documents. Java provides `FileInputStream` and `FileOutputStream` for this purpose.

```java
import java.io.FileInputStream;
import java.io.FileOutputStream;
import java.io.IOException;

public class BinaryFileDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Copying a binary file
        try (FileInputStream in = new FileInputStream("source.jpg");
             FileOutputStream out = new FileOutputStream("destination.jpg")) {
            
            byte[] buffer = new byte[1024];
            int length;
            
            while ((length = in.read(buffer)) > 0) {
                out.write(buffer, 0, length);
            }
            
            System.out.println("Binary file copied successfully!");
            
        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.out.println("An error occurred while copying the file.");
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

## Practical Example: Configuration File Reader

Let's create a practical example that could be useful in Spring applications: reading a properties file to load configuration:

```java
import java.io.FileInputStream;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.util.Properties;

public class ConfigReader {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Properties properties = new Properties();
        
        try (FileInputStream input = new FileInputStream("config.properties")) {
            // Load the properties file
            properties.load(input);
            
            // Access properties
            String dbUrl = properties.getProperty("database.url");
            String dbUser = properties.getProperty("database.user");
            String appName = properties.getProperty("application.name");
            
            // Use the configuration
            System.out.println("Application: " + appName);
            System.out.println("Database URL: " + dbUrl);
            System.out.println("Database User: " + dbUser);
            
        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.out.println("Failed to load configuration file.");
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

For this example, create a file named `config.properties` with the following content:

```
application.name=My Java Application
database.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydb
database.user=admin
```

**Output:**
```
Application: My Java Application
Database URL: jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydb
Database User: admin
```

## File Handling Best Practices

1. **Always close resources**: Use try-with-resources statements to ensure streams are properly closed
2. **Handle exceptions appropriately**: File operations can fail for various reasons
3. **Use buffered streams**: For better performance when dealing with large files
4. **Use the NIO.2 API**: When possible, use the newer API for more powerful features
5. **Check file existence**: Always verify if files exist before trying to read them

## Real-world Application: CSV Data Processor

Here's a more complex example that reads data from a CSV file, processes it, and writes the results to another file - similar to what you might do in a Spring application:

```java
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.BufferedWriter;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.FileWriter;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class CsvProcessor {
    
    static class Product {
        private String name;
        private double price;
        private int quantity;
        
        public Product(String name, double price, int quantity) {
            this.name = name;
            this.price = price;
            this.quantity = quantity;
        }
        
        public double getTotalValue() {
            return price * quantity;
        }
        
        @Override
        public String toString() {
            return name + "," + price + "," + quantity + "," + getTotalValue();
        }
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<Product> products = new ArrayList<>();
        
        // Read data from CSV
        try (BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("products.csv"))) {
            // Skip header
            String header = reader.readLine();
            String line;
            
            while ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) {
                String[] parts = line.split(",");
                if (parts.length == 3) {
                    String name = parts[0];
                    double price = Double.parseDouble(parts[1]);
                    int quantity = Integer.parseInt(parts[2]);
                    
                    products.add(new Product(name, price, quantity));
                }
            }
            
            System.out.println("Loaded " + products.size() + " products");
            
        } catch (IOException | NumberFormatException e) {
            System.out.println("Error processing CSV file: " + e.getMessage());
            return;
        }
        
        // Process and write output
        try (BufferedWriter writer = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter("processed_products.csv"))) {
            // Write header
            writer.write("Product Name,Price,Quantity,Total Value");
            writer.newLine();
            
            // Write data
            for (Product product : products) {
                writer.write(product.toString());
                writer.newLine();
            }
            
            System.out.println("Processed data written to processed_products.csv");
            
        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.out.println("Error writing to output file: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```

For this example, create a file named `products.csv` with:

```
Product Name,Price,Quantity
Coffee Maker,89.99,5
Blender,49.95,10
Toaster,29.99,15
```

This code demonstrates reading from a CSV file, processing the data (calculating total value), and writing the results to a new file - common tasks in business applications.

## Summary

Java provides comprehensive file handling capabilities that let you interact with the file system in various ways:

- Basic file operations using `File` class
- Reading and writing text files with `FileReader`, `FileWriter`, `BufferedReader`, and `BufferedWriter`
- Modern file operations with `Files` and `Paths` classes
- Processing binary files using `FileInputStream` and `FileOutputStream`
- Working with configuration files using `Properties`

These skills form the foundation for working with files in Spring applications, where you'll often need to read configuration files, process data files, and handle application resources.

## Exercises

To reinforce your learning, try these exercises:

1. Create a program that counts the number of lines, words, and characters in a text file
2. Implement a simple log file analyzer that reads a log file and counts occurrences of "ERROR", "WARNING", and "INFO" messages
3. Build a program that merges multiple text files into a single file
4. Create a simple file encryption/decryption tool using XOR operations
5. Implement a directory browser that lists all files in a directory and its subdirectories
