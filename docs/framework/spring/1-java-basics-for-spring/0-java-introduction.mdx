# Java Introduction

## What is Java?

Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. Developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems (now owned by Oracle Corporation) in the mid-1990s, Java has evolved to become one of the most popular programming languages in the world.

Before diving into Spring Framework, having a solid foundation in Java is essential as Spring is built on Java and leverages many of Java's core concepts.

## Why Java Matters for Spring Development

Spring Framework is built entirely on Java, making Java proficiency a prerequisite for effective Spring development. Understanding Java fundamentals will allow you to:

- Comprehend Spring's architecture and design patterns
- Write efficient and maintainable Spring applications
- Leverage Java features that Spring utilizes extensively
- Troubleshoot issues that may arise during development

## Key Features of Java

Java offers several features that make it particularly suitable for enterprise applications:

### 1. Platform Independence

Java follows the "Write Once, Run Anywhere" (WORA) principle through its compilation to bytecode that runs on any Java Virtual Machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture.

### 2. Object-Oriented

Java is built around objects, classes, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism, making it ideal for modular, extensible applications.

### 3. Robust and Secure

Java's strong memory management, exception handling, and type-checking mechanisms contribute to its robustness. Its security features make it suitable for networked applications.

### 4. Rich Standard Library

Java comes with a comprehensive standard library (Java API) that provides ready-to-use components for various programming tasks.

## Setting Up Your Java Development Environment

Before writing your first Java program, you need to set up your development environment:

### 1. Install the Java Development Kit (JDK)

The JDK contains everything needed to develop and run Java applications.

1. Visit the [Oracle JDK download page](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/) or use OpenJDK
2. Download the appropriate version for your operating system (JDK 11 or 17 is recommended for Spring)
3. Follow the installation instructions

### 2. Verify Your Installation

After installation, open your command prompt or terminal and type:

```bash
java -version
javac -version
```

Both commands should return version information if Java is properly installed.

## Your First Java Program

Let's create a simple "Hello, World!" program to ensure everything is working correctly:

1. Create a file named `HelloWorld.java` with the following content:

```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World! Welcome to Java for Spring!");
    }
}
```

2. Open your terminal, navigate to the directory containing your file, and run:

```bash
javac HelloWorld.java
java HelloWorld
```

3. You should see the output:

```
Hello, World! Welcome to Java for Spring!
```

### Understanding the Code

Let's break down what each part of the code does:

- `public class HelloWorld`: Defines a class named "HelloWorld"
- `public static void main(String[] args)`: The entry point method that's executed when the program runs
- `System.out.println("Hello, World! Welcome to Java for Spring!")`: Outputs the text to the console

## Basic Java Syntax

### Variables and Data Types

Java is a strongly typed language, which means you need to declare a variable's type before using it.

```java
// Primitive data types
int age = 25;                // Integer (whole number)
double salary = 5000.50;     // Double-precision floating point number
boolean isEmployed = true;   // Boolean value (true or false)
char grade = 'A';            // Single character

// Reference data types
String name = "John Doe";    // String (sequence of characters)
```

### Control Structures

#### Conditional Statements

```java
int score = 85;

if (score >= 90) {
    System.out.println("Excellent!");
} else if (score >= 70) {
    System.out.println("Good job!");
} else {
    System.out.println("Keep practicing!");
}
```

Output:
```
Good job!
```

#### Loops

```java
// For loop
System.out.println("Counting with a for loop:");
for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
    System.out.println("Count: " + i);
}

// While loop
System.out.println("\nCounting with a while loop:");
int j = 1;
while (j <= 5) {
    System.out.println("Count: " + j);
    j++;
}
```

Output:
```
Counting with a for loop:
Count: 1
Count: 2
Count: 3
Count: 4
Count: 5

Counting with a while loop:
Count: 1
Count: 2
Count: 3
Count: 4
Count: 5
```

## Object-Oriented Programming in Java

Java is fundamentally object-oriented. Here's a simple class example:

```java
public class Person {
    // Fields (attributes)
    private String name;
    private int age;
    
    // Constructor
    public Person(String name, int age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }
    
    // Methods
    public void introduce() {
        System.out.println("Hello, my name is " + name + " and I am " + age + " years old.");
    }
    
    // Getters and Setters
    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }
    
    public void setName(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
    
    public int getAge() {
        return age;
    }
    
    public void setAge(int age) {
        this.age = age;
    }
}
```

Using the `Person` class:

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Person person = new Person("Alice", 28);
        person.introduce();
        
        // Using getters and setters
        System.out.println("Name: " + person.getName());
        person.setAge(29);
        System.out.println("Updated age: " + person.getAge());
    }
}
```

Output:
```
Hello, my name is Alice and I am 28 years old.
Name: Alice
Updated age: 29
```

## Real-World Application: A Simple Spring-Related Example

Let's create a simple model class that might be used in a Spring application to represent a product in an e-commerce system:

```java
import java.math.BigDecimal;
import java.time.LocalDateTime;

public class Product {
    private Long id;
    private String name;
    private String description;
    private BigDecimal price;
    private int stockQuantity;
    private LocalDateTime createdAt;
    private LocalDateTime updatedAt;
    
    // Constructor
    public Product(String name, String description, BigDecimal price, int stockQuantity) {
        this.name = name;
        this.description = description;
        this.price = price;
        this.stockQuantity = stockQuantity;
        this.createdAt = LocalDateTime.now();
        this.updatedAt = LocalDateTime.now();
    }
    
    // Business logic
    public boolean isInStock() {
        return stockQuantity > 0;
    }
    
    public void decreaseStock(int quantity) {
        if (quantity <= 0) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Quantity must be positive");
        }
        
        if (quantity > stockQuantity) {
            throw new IllegalStateException("Not enough items in stock");
        }
        
        stockQuantity -= quantity;
        updatedAt = LocalDateTime.now();
    }
    
    public BigDecimal calculateTotalPrice(int quantity) {
        return price.multiply(new BigDecimal(quantity));
    }
    
    // Getters and setters (abbreviated for brevity)
    public Long getId() { return id; }
    public void setId(Long id) { this.id = id; }
    
    public String getName() { return name; }
    public void setName(String name) { this.name = name; }
    
    // Other getters and setters would follow...
    
    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return "Product{" +
                "id=" + id +
                ", name='" + name + '\'' +
                ", price=" + price +
                ", stockQuantity=" + stockQuantity +
                '}';
    }
}
```

Using this `Product` class:

```java
import java.math.BigDecimal;

public class EcommerceDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a product
        Product laptop = new Product(
            "MacBook Pro", 
            "13-inch, 8GB RAM, 512GB SSD", 
            new BigDecimal("1299.99"), 
            10
        );
        
        // Check if in stock
        System.out.println("Is product in stock? " + laptop.isInStock());
        
        // Calculate price of buying 2 units
        BigDecimal totalPrice = laptop.calculateTotalPrice(2);
        System.out.println("Price for 2 units: $" + totalPrice);
        
        // Process an order
        try {
            System.out.println("Processing order...");
            laptop.decreaseStock(2);
            System.out.println("Order processed successfully!");
        } catch (Exception e) {
            System.out.println("Error processing order: " + e.getMessage());
        }
        
        // Show updated product information
        System.out.println("Updated product information: " + laptop);
    }
}
```

This example demonstrates:
- Creating a business model with appropriate data types
- Implementing basic business logic
- Exception handling
- Method overriding (toString)
- Object instantiation and manipulation
