# Java Annotations

## Introduction

Annotations are a special form of syntactic metadata that can be added to Java source code. They were introduced in Java 5 as a way to provide additional information about code elements (classes, methods, variables, etc.) without affecting the program's execution directly. Think of annotations as "labels" or "tags" attached to different parts of your code.

In the context of Spring, annotations play a crucial role. They are extensively used to configure Spring applications, reduce boilerplate configuration code, and make your applications more maintainable and readable. Before diving into Spring-specific annotations, it's important to understand the fundamental concepts of Java annotations.

## What Are Java Annotations?

Annotations provide data about a program that is not part of the program itself. They have no direct effect on the operation of the code they annotate. Instead, they provide information for:

- **Compiler**: Annotations can be used by the compiler to detect errors or suppress warnings
- **Runtime processing**: Some annotations are available to the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) at runtime
- **Compile-time or deployment-time processing**: Tools can process annotation information to generate code, XML files, etc.

Annotations are defined using the `@interface` keyword, and they are applied by using the `@` symbol followed by the annotation name.

## Basic Syntax

An annotation has the following syntax:

```java
@AnnotationName(attribute1 = value1, attribute2 = value2, ...)
```

For annotations with a single attribute named "value," you can use a simplified syntax:

```java
@AnnotationName(value)
```

## Built-in Java Annotations

Java provides several built-in annotations. Let's explore some of the most commonly used ones:

### `@Override`

The `@Override` annotation indicates that the annotated method is intended to override a method in a superclass.

```java
class Parent {
    public void display() {
        System.out.println("Parent display method");
    }
}

class Child extends Parent {
    @Override
    public void display() {
        System.out.println("Child display method");
    }
}
```

If you misspell the method name or provide an incorrect signature, the compiler will catch this error.

### `@Deprecated`

The `@Deprecated` annotation indicates that the annotated element is deprecated and should no longer be used.

```java
class OldClass {
    @Deprecated
    public void oldMethod() {
        System.out.println("This method is deprecated");
    }
    
    public void newMethod() {
        System.out.println("Use this method instead");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        OldClass obj = new OldClass();
        // This will produce a warning
        obj.oldMethod();
    }
}
```

### `@SuppressWarnings`

The `@SuppressWarnings` annotation tells the compiler to suppress specific warnings that would otherwise be generated.

```java
public class WarningExample {
    @SuppressWarnings("unchecked")
    public void suppressWarningMethod() {
        // This raw type usage would normally generate a warning
        java.util.ArrayList list = new java.util.ArrayList();
        list.add("Item");
    }
}
```

### `@FunctionalInterface`

The `@FunctionalInterface` annotation, introduced in Java 8, is used to indicate that the interface is intended to be a functional interface, which has exactly one abstract method.

```java
@FunctionalInterface
interface Calculator {
    int calculate(int a, int b);
    
    // Default methods don't count against the single abstract method rule
    default void printInfo() {
        System.out.println("This is a calculator interface");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // We can use lambda expressions with functional interfaces
        Calculator addition = (a, b) -> a + b;
        Calculator subtraction = (a, b) -> a - b;
        
        System.out.println("5 + 3 = " + addition.calculate(5, 3));      // Output: 5 + 3 = 8
        System.out.println("5 - 3 = " + subtraction.calculate(5, 3));   // Output: 5 - 3 = 2
    }
}
```

## Creating Custom Annotations

You can create your own annotations in Java. Here's how to create a simple custom annotation:

```java
import java.lang.annotation.ElementType;
import java.lang.annotation.Retention;
import java.lang.annotation.RetentionPolicy;
import java.lang.annotation.Target;

// Define where this annotation can be applied
@Target(ElementType.METHOD)
// Define how long the annotation should be retained
@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
public @interface AuthorInfo {
    String author();
    String date();
    int revision() default 1;
    String[] comments() default {};
}
```

Now you can use this annotation:

```java
public class AnnotationExample {
    @AuthorInfo(author = "John Doe", date = "2023-07-15", 
                comments = {"Initial implementation", "Needs review"})
    public void someMethod() {
        System.out.println("Method with custom annotation");
    }
}
```

## Meta-Annotations

Meta-annotations are annotations that can be applied to other annotations. Here are the most important ones:

### `@Retention`

Specifies how long the annotation should be retained:
- `RetentionPolicy.SOURCE`: Only in the source code, discarded by compiler
- `RetentionPolicy.CLASS`: Kept by the compiler, but not available at runtime
- `RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME`: Kept by the JVM, available at runtime through reflection

### `@Target`

Restricts what elements can be annotated:
- `ElementType.TYPE`: Classes, interfaces, and enums
- `ElementType.FIELD`: Fields
- `ElementType.METHOD`: Methods
- `ElementType.PARAMETER`: Method parameters
- `ElementType.CONSTRUCTOR`: Constructors
- `ElementType.LOCAL_VARIABLE`: Local variables
- And others...

### `@Documented`

Indicates that the annotation should be documented by JavaDoc.

### `@Inherited`

Indicates that the annotation can be inherited from the superclass.

### `@Repeatable`

Introduced in Java 8, it allows an annotation to be used multiple times on the same element.

## Annotations and Reflection

One of the most powerful aspects of annotations is that they can be inspected at runtime using Java's reflection API. This is how frameworks like Spring use annotations to configure your application.

Here's a simple example of accessing annotations at runtime:

```java
import java.lang.reflect.Method;

public class AnnotationReader {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            // Get the class
            Class<?> clazz = AnnotationExample.class;
            
            // Get the method
            Method method = clazz.getMethod("someMethod");
            
            // Check if the method has our annotation
            if (method.isAnnotationPresent(AuthorInfo.class)) {
                // Get the annotation
                AuthorInfo info = method.getAnnotation(AuthorInfo.class);
                
                // Use the annotation data
                System.out.println("Author: " + info.author());
                System.out.println("Date: " + info.date());
                System.out.println("Revision: " + info.revision());
                
                System.out.println("Comments:");
                for (String comment : info.comments()) {
                    System.out.println("- " + comment);
                }
            }
        } catch (NoSuchMethodException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

Output:

## Annotations in Spring

While this lesson focuses on Java annotations fundamentals, it's worth noting how crucial they are in Spring development. Spring uses annotations extensively for:

1. **Dependency Injection**: `@Autowired`, `@Qualifier`, `@Value`
2. **Component Scanning**: `@Component`, `@Service`, `@Repository`, `@Controller`
3. **Configuration**: `@Configuration`, `@Bean`
4. **Aspect-Oriented Programming**: `@Aspect`, `@Before`, `@After`
5. **Transaction Management**: `@Transactional`
6. **REST APIs**: `@RestController`, `@RequestMapping`, `@PathVariable`
7. **Testing**: `@SpringBootTest`, `@Mock`, `@MockBean`

Here's a simple example of Spring annotations in action:

```java
@Service
public class UserService {
    private final UserRepository userRepository;
    
    @Autowired
    public UserService(UserRepository userRepository) {
        this.userRepository = userRepository;
    }
    
    @Transactional
    public User createUser(String name, String email) {
        User user = new User(name, email);
        return userRepository.save(user);
    }
}
```

In this example:
- `@Service` tells Spring that this class should be managed as a service bean
- `@Autowired` indicates that the `UserRepository` dependency should be injected
- `@Transactional` ensures that the method is executed within a database transaction

## Real-World Example: Custom Validation Annotation

Let's create a custom validation annotation to check if a string is a valid email:

```java
import java.lang.annotation.ElementType;
import java.lang.annotation.Retention;
import java.lang.annotation.RetentionPolicy;
import java.lang.annotation.Target;
import java.util.regex.Pattern;
import javax.validation.Constraint;
import javax.validation.ConstraintValidator;
import javax.validation.ConstraintValidatorContext;
import javax.validation.Payload;

@Target({ElementType.FIELD, ElementType.METHOD, ElementType.PARAMETER})
@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
@Constraint(validatedBy = ValidEmail.Validator.class)
public @interface ValidEmail {
    String message() default "Invalid email address";
    Class<?>[] groups() default {};
    Class<? extends Payload>[] payload() default {};
    
    class Validator implements ConstraintValidator<ValidEmail, String> {
        private static final Pattern EMAIL_PATTERN = Pattern.compile(
            "^[a-zA-Z0-9_+&*-]+(?:\\.[a-zA-Z0-9_+&*-]+)*@(?:[a-zA-Z0-9-]+\\.)+[a-zA-Z]{2,7}$"
        );
        
        @Override
        public boolean isValid(String value, ConstraintValidatorContext context) {
            if (value == null || value.isEmpty()) {
                return true; // Let @NotNull or @NotEmpty handle this
            }
            return EMAIL_PATTERN.matcher(value).matches();
        }
    }
}
```

Now, you can use this annotation in a user registration form:

```java
public class UserRegistrationForm {
    private String name;
    
    @ValidEmail
    private String email;
    
    // Getters and setters
}
```

In a Spring application, this validation would automatically be triggered when the form is submitted, preventing invalid emails from being processed.

## Summary

Java annotations provide a powerful mechanism to add metadata to your code. They serve as a way to communicate extra information to the compiler, runtime environment, or other tools without changing the logic of your program.

Key points covered:
- Annotations are a form of metadata that can be added to Java code
- They begin with the `@` symbol and can include elements with values
- Java provides built-in annotations like `@Override`, `@Deprecated`, etc.
- Custom annotations can be created to serve specific needs
- Meta-annotations define how annotations can be used
- Annotations work with reflection to enable runtime access to metadata
- Spring Framework uses annotations extensively to configure and simplify applications

As you move forward with Spring, you'll encounter many annotations that make Java development more efficient by reducing boilerplate code and providing clear intent for different parts of your application.

## Practice Exercises

1. Create a custom annotation called `@LogMethod` that, when applied to a method, prints the method name and parameters when the method is called (hint: you'll need to learn about Aspect-Oriented Programming in Spring).

2. Create a custom `@Cacheable` annotation that can be used to cache the results of a method call based on its parameters.

3. Research and list five Spring annotations that you find most useful, describing what each one does and providing a simple example of its usage.

4. Implement a custom validation annotation that checks if a string is a valid phone number.
