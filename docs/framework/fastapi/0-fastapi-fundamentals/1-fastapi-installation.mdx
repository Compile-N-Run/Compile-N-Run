# FastAPI Installation

Welcome to the first step in your FastAPI journey! This guide will walk you through installing FastAPI and setting up your development environment. FastAPI is a modern, fast web framework for building APIs with Python based on standard Python type hints.

## Prerequisites

Before installing FastAPI, make sure you have:

- Python 3.7+ (FastAPI requires Python 3.7 or above)
- Basic knowledge of Python programming
- A terminal or command prompt

## Installation Methods

### Method 1: Using pip (Recommended)

The simplest way to install FastAPI is using pip, Python's package installer:

```bash
pip install fastapi uvicorn
```

We're installing two packages:
- **FastAPI**: The framework itself
- **Uvicorn**: An ASGI server required to run FastAPI applications

#### Verifying Installation

To verify the installation was successful, you can check the installed versions:

```bash
pip show fastapi
pip show uvicorn
```

### Method 2: Using a Virtual Environment (Best Practice)

For a cleaner development environment, it's recommended to use virtual environments:

#### 1. Create a virtual environment

```bash
# On Windows
python -m venv fastapi-env

# On macOS/Linux
python3 -m venv fastapi-env
```

#### 2. Activate the virtual environment

```bash
# On Windows
fastapi-env\Scripts\activate

# On macOS/Linux
source fastapi-env/bin/activate
```

#### 3. Install FastAPI and Uvicorn

```bash
pip install fastapi uvicorn
```

### Optional Dependencies

FastAPI has several optional dependencies that provide additional features:

```bash
# For full features including data validation
pip install "fastapi[all]"
```

This will install:
- **Uvicorn**: ASGI server with reload capability
- **Pydantic**: For data validation
- **Starlette**: The core of FastAPI
- **Email validator**: For email validation
- **PyJWT**: For JWT tokens
- **Python-multipart**: For form data parsing
- **Itsdangerous**: For security features
- **SQLAlchemy**: For database support
- **Ujson**: For fast JSON parsing

## Creating Your First FastAPI App

Let's create a simple "Hello World" application to test our installation:

1. Create a file named `main.py` with the following content:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/")
def read_root():
    return {"Hello": "World"}
```

2. Run the server:

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

3. Open your browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`. You should see:

```json
{
  "Hello": "World"
}
```

The `--reload` flag enables hot reloading, which means your application will automatically update when you make changes to the code.

## Understanding the Installation Components

### FastAPI Framework

The core framework that provides all the functionality for building APIs. It is built on top of Starlette for web parts and Pydantic for data validation.

### Uvicorn

An ASGI server implementation that FastAPI applications run on. ASGI (Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface) allows asynchronous Python web applications to communicate with the server.

## Troubleshooting Common Installation Issues

### Issue 1: Python Version

If you encounter an error like:

```
ERROR: fastapi requires Python >=3.7
```

Solution: Update your Python version to 3.7 or higher.

### Issue 2: Permission Errors

```
ERROR: Could not install packages due to an EnvironmentError: [Errno 13] Permission denied
```

Solution: Use the `--user` flag or run the command with administrator/sudo privileges:

```bash
pip install --user fastapi uvicorn
```

### Issue 3: Dependency Conflicts

If you have conflicting packages:

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install "fastapi[all]" --upgrade
```

## Real-world Application: Project Structure Setup

For a real project, you might want to set up a more organized structure:

```
my-fastapi-project/
├── app/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── main.py
│   ├── models/
│   │   └── __init__.py
│   ├── routes/
│   │   └── __init__.py
│   └── services/
│       └── __init__.py
├── requirements.txt
└── README.md
```

Create a `requirements.txt` file:

```
fastapi>=0.100.0
uvicorn>=0.22.0
pydantic>=2.0.0
```

Then install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Summary

You've successfully installed FastAPI and learned how to:
- Install FastAPI using pip
- Set up a virtual environment for your project
- Create a simple "Hello World" application
- Structure a real-world FastAPI project

FastAPI is now ready to use on your system! With this setup, you're prepared to build high-performance, easy-to-develop APIs using Python's type hints.

## Exercises

1. Create a FastAPI application with two different routes, returning different data types.
2. Set up a FastAPI project using a virtual environment and create a custom `requirements.txt` file.
3. Implement a FastAPI application that receives a query parameter and returns it as part of the response.
