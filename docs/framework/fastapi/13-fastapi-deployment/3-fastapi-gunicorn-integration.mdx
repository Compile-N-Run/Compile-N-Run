# FastAPI Gunicorn Integration

## Introduction

When deploying a FastAPI application to production, using the built-in development server (Uvicorn) is not recommended due to its limitations in handling concurrent requests and managing resources effectively. This is where Gunicorn (Green Unicorn) comes into the picture.

Gunicorn is a WSGI HTTP server for Python web applications that acts as a process manager, helping to:
- Manage multiple worker processes
- Handle concurrent requests efficiently
- Automatically restart failed processes
- Provide better resource utilization

In this tutorial, we'll learn how to integrate FastAPI with Gunicorn to achieve a production-grade deployment setup.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, ensure you have:

- Python 3.7+ installed
- Basic knowledge of FastAPI
- Understanding of virtual environments

## Setting Up Your Environment

Let's start by creating a virtual environment and installing the necessary packages:

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate the environment
# On Windows
venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate

# Install required packages
pip install fastapi uvicorn gunicorn
```

## Creating a Simple FastAPI Application

First, let's create a basic FastAPI application that we'll deploy with Gunicorn:

```python
# main.py
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/")
async def root():
    return {"message": "Hello World"}

@app.get("/items/{item_id}")
async def read_item(item_id: int):
    return {"item_id": item_id}
```

## Understanding Gunicorn Workers

Gunicorn uses a pre-fork worker model, which means it creates multiple worker processes to handle incoming requests. Each worker can process one request at a time.

For FastAPI applications, we need to use Uvicorn workers with Gunicorn, as FastAPI is built on ASGI (not WSGI). Gunicorn provides a way to use worker classes from other servers.

### Worker Types for FastAPI

There are several worker types you can use with FastAPI:

1. `uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker`: Standard Uvicorn worker
2. `uvicorn.workers.UvicornH11Worker`: Uses H11 for HTTP protocol
3. `uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorkerProcess`: Enhanced worker designed for use with Gunicorn

## Configuring Gunicorn for FastAPI

### Basic Command Line Configuration

The most basic way to run FastAPI with Gunicorn is using the command line:

```bash
gunicorn main:app -w 4 -k uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker
```

This command:
- Starts Gunicorn
- Uses your `main.py` file and loads the `app` object
- Creates 4 worker processes (`-w 4`)
- Uses the Uvicorn worker class (`-k uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker`)

### Creating a Gunicorn Configuration File

For more control, create a `gunicorn_conf.py` file:

```python
# gunicorn_conf.py
import multiprocessing

# Gunicorn config variables
workers_per_core_str = "1"
max_workers_str = "8"
web_concurrency_str = None

# Gunicorn worker configuration
worker_class_str = "uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker"
loglevel = "info"
bind = "0.0.0.0:8000"
keepalive = 120
timeout = 120
errorlog = "-"

# Worker processes
cores = multiprocessing.cpu_count()
workers_per_core = float(workers_per_core_str)
default_web_concurrency = workers_per_core * cores
if web_concurrency_str:
    web_concurrency = int(web_concurrency_str)
else:
    web_concurrency = max(int(default_web_concurrency), 2)
    if max_workers_str:
        web_concurrency = min(web_concurrency, int(max_workers_str))

workers = web_concurrency
```

Now you can run Gunicorn using this configuration:

```bash
gunicorn main:app -c gunicorn_conf.py
```

## Optimizing Worker Count

The number of workers is a critical configuration for performance. A common formula is:

`workers = (2 * CPU cores) + 1`

This formula ensures efficient use of CPU resources while leaving some capacity for the OS and other processes.

Example for a 4-core server:
```
workers = (2 * 4) + 1 = 9 workers
```

## Creating a Start-Up Script

For better management, create a start-up script that configures and launches Gunicorn:

```python
# start.py
import subprocess
import sys

def main():
    # Command to run Gunicorn
    cmd = [
        "gunicorn",
        "main:app",
        "--workers", "4",
        "--worker-class", "uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker",
        "--bind", "0.0.0.0:8000",
        "--timeout", "120"
    ]
    
    # Execute the command
    try:
        subprocess.run(cmd, check=True)
    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
        print(f"Error running Gunicorn: {e}", file=sys.stderr)
        sys.exit(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Run the script with:

```bash
python start.py
```

## Practical Example: Creating a Production-Ready API

Let's create a more realistic example with multiple endpoints and demonstrate how to deploy it with Gunicorn:

```python
# advanced_app.py
from fastapi import FastAPI, Depends, HTTPException, status
from pydantic import BaseModel
from typing import List, Optional
import time

app = FastAPI(title="Product API")

# Simulate database
fake_db = {}
item_id_counter = 0

class Item(BaseModel):
    name: str
    description: Optional[str] = None
    price: float
    tax: Optional[float] = None

@app.middleware("http")
async def add_process_time_header(request, call_next):
    start_time = time.time()
    response = await call_next(request)
    process_time = time.time() - start_time
    response.headers["X-Process-Time"] = str(process_time)
    return response

@app.get("/")
async def root():
    return {"status": "API is running"}

@app.post("/items/", status_code=status.HTTP_201_CREATED)
async def create_item(item: Item):
    global item_id_counter
    item_id_counter += 1
    fake_db[item_id_counter] = item.dict()
    return {"id": item_id_counter, **fake_db[item_id_counter]}

@app.get("/items/", response_model=List[dict])
async def list_items():
    return [{"id": id, **item} for id, item in fake_db.items()]

@app.get("/items/{item_id}")
async def read_item(item_id: int):
    if item_id not in fake_db:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Item not found")
    return {"id": item_id, **fake_db[item_id]}

@app.put("/items/{item_id}")
async def update_item(item_id: int, item: Item):
    if item_id not in fake_db:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Item not found")
    fake_db[item_id] = item.dict()
    return {"id": item_id, **fake_db[item_id]}

@app.delete("/items/{item_id}")
async def delete_item(item_id: int):
    if item_id not in fake_db:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Item not found")
    del fake_db[item_id]
    return {"message": "Item deleted successfully"}
```

To deploy this with Gunicorn:

```bash
gunicorn advanced_app:app -w 4 -k uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker --bind 0.0.0.0:8000
```

## Handling Graceful Shutdowns

Gunicorn can handle graceful shutdowns, which is important for production applications. When you send a SIGTERM signal to Gunicorn, it will:

1. Stop accepting new requests
2. Wait for active requests to complete (up to the timeout value)
3. Shutdown workers gracefully

You can configure shutdown behavior in your Gunicorn configuration:

```python
# Add to gunicorn_conf.py
graceful_timeout = 30  # Time for workers to complete active requests
```

## Advanced Configuration with Environment Variables

For production deployments, it's common to use environment variables for configuration:

```python
# gunicorn_conf_env.py
import os
import multiprocessing

# Get environment variables or use defaults
workers_per_core_str = os.getenv("WORKERS_PER_CORE", "1")
max_workers_str = os.getenv("MAX_WORKERS", "8")
web_concurrency_str = os.getenv("WEB_CONCURRENCY", None)
host = os.getenv("HOST", "0.0.0.0")
port = os.getenv("PORT", "8000")
bind_env = os.getenv("BIND", None)
use_loglevel = os.getenv("LOG_LEVEL", "info")

# Gunicorn config variables
loglevel = use_loglevel
workers_per_core = float(workers_per_core_str)
cores = multiprocessing.cpu_count()
default_web_concurrency = workers_per_core * cores

# Configure binding
if bind_env:
    bind = bind_env
else:
    bind = f"{host}:{port}"

# Worker processes
if web_concurrency_str:
    web_concurrency = int(web_concurrency_str)
else:
    web_concurrency = max(int(default_web_concurrency), 2)
    if max_workers_str:
        web_concurrency = min(web_concurrency, int(max_workers_str))

# Gunicorn settings
workers = web_concurrency
worker_class = "uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker"
keepalive = 120
timeout = 120
```

## Running Behind a Reverse Proxy

In production, Gunicorn should typically run behind a reverse proxy like Nginx:

```
Client → Nginx → Gunicorn → FastAPI
```

Basic Nginx configuration for FastAPI:

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name example.com;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:8000;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }
}
```
