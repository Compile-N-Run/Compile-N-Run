# FastAPI Google Cloud Deployment

## Introduction

Deploying your FastAPI application to the cloud is a critical step in making your API accessible to users worldwide. Google Cloud Platform (GCP) offers several services that make deployment straightforward, scalable, and cost-effective. In this guide, we'll explore how to deploy FastAPI applications on Google Cloud using three popular services: Cloud Run, App Engine, and Compute Engine.

By the end of this tutorial, you'll understand:
- The different GCP deployment options for FastAPI
- How to prepare your FastAPI app for cloud deployment
- Step-by-step deployment processes for each GCP service
- Best practices for monitoring and scaling your deployed application

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have:

- A FastAPI application ready for deployment
- Basic knowledge of FastAPI and Python
- A Google Cloud account
- Google Cloud SDK installed on your local machine
- Docker installed (for Cloud Run deployments)

## Preparing Your FastAPI Application for GCP Deployment

Before deploying to any Google Cloud service, we need to properly structure our FastAPI application:

### 1. Project Structure

A typical FastAPI project for cloud deployment should look like this:

```
project_directory/
├── app/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── main.py         # FastAPI application
│   ├── routers/        # API routes
│   ├── models/         # Data models
│   └── dependencies/   # Shared dependencies
├── Dockerfile          # For containerized deployments
├── requirements.txt    # Dependencies
├── .gcloudignore       # Files to ignore when deploying
└── app.yaml            # For App Engine deployments
```

### 2. Create a `main.py` File

Here's an example of a basic FastAPI application in `app/main.py`:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
import uvicorn
import os

app = FastAPI(title="My FastAPI App")

@app.get("/")
async def root():
    return {"message": "Hello from Google Cloud!"}

@app.get("/health")
async def health_check():
    return {"status": "healthy"}

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # This is used when running locally
    port = int(os.environ.get("PORT", 8080))
    uvicorn.run("app.main:app", host="0.0.0.0", port=port, reload=False)
```

### 3. Create a `requirements.txt` File

```
fastapi>=0.103.1
uvicorn>=0.23.2
gunicorn>=21.2.0
```

## Option 1: Deploying FastAPI to Google Cloud Run

Cloud Run is an excellent choice for FastAPI applications because it:
- Is fully managed and serverless
- Automatically scales to zero when not in use
- Only charges for the exact resources you use
- Supports any containerized application

### Step 1: Create a Dockerfile

Create a `Dockerfile` in your project root:

```dockerfile
# Use the official Python image as a parent image
FROM python:3.11-slim

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /code

# Copy the dependencies file to the working directory
COPY requirements.txt .

# Install dependencies
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir --upgrade -r requirements.txt

# Copy the content of the local src directory to the working directory
COPY ./app /code/app

# Specify that the container listens on port 8080
EXPOSE 8080

# Command to run the application with Gunicorn as the WSGI server
CMD exec gunicorn -k uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker -b :8080 app.main:app --workers 2
```

### Step 2: Build and Test Your Container Locally

```bash
# Build the container
docker build -t fastapi-app .

# Run the container locally
docker run -p 8080:8080 fastapi-app
```

Visit `http://localhost:8080` in your browser to test if your API is working.

### Step 3: Deploy to Cloud Run

```bash
# Enable required APIs
gcloud services enable cloudbuild.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable run.googleapis.com

# Build and deploy in one command
gcloud run deploy fastapi-service \
  --source . \
  --platform managed \
  --region us-central1 \
  --allow-unauthenticated \
  --memory 512Mi
```

The command will build your container image using Cloud Build, push it to Google Container Registry, and deploy it to Cloud Run.

After deployment, you'll receive a URL where your API is accessible, something like: `https://fastapi-service-abcdef123-uc.a.run.app`

### Step 4: Verify the Deployment

Visit your deployment URL to verify that your API is working properly. You can also check the `/docs` endpoint (e.g., `https://fastapi-service-abcdef123-uc.a.run.app/docs`) to see your API documentation.

## Option 2: Deploying FastAPI to Google App Engine

Google App Engine (GAE) is another excellent choice for FastAPI applications, offering:
- Simplified deployment without managing containers
- Automatic scaling based on traffic
- Integration with other Google Cloud services
- Built-in health checks and version management

### Step 1: Create an `app.yaml` File

Create an `app.yaml` file in your project root:

```yaml
runtime: python311
entrypoint: gunicorn -k uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker -b :$PORT app.main:app --workers 2

instance_class: F2

automatic_scaling:
  min_instances: 0
  max_instances: 10
  target_cpu_utilization: 0.65

env_variables:
  DEBUG: "False"
```

### Step 2: Create a `.gcloudignore` File

Create a `.gcloudignore` file to prevent unnecessary files from being uploaded:

```
.git
.gitignore
.env
.venv
env/
venv/
ENV/
__pycache__/
*.py[cod]
*$py.class
```

### Step 3: Deploy to App Engine

```bash
# Enable App Engine API if you haven't already
gcloud services enable appengine.googleapis.com

# Deploy your application
gcloud app deploy
```

When prompted, select the region for your App Engine application. After deployment completes, you can access your API at `https://[YOUR-PROJECT-ID].appspot.com`.

### Step 4: View Logs and Monitor

```bash
# View logs
gcloud app logs tail

# Open the deployment in a browser
gcloud app browse
```

## Option 3: Deploying FastAPI to Google Compute Engine

For maximum control over your environment, you might want to deploy FastAPI to a Compute Engine VM:

### Step 1: Create a VM Instance

```bash
gcloud compute instances create fastapi-vm \
  --image-family=debian-11 \
  --image-project=debian-cloud \
  --machine-type=e2-micro \
  --tags=http-server,https-server \
  --metadata=startup-script='#! /bin/bash
    apt-get update
    apt-get install -y python3-pip git
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-fastapi-repo.git /opt/app
    cd /opt/app
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    nohup gunicorn -k uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker -b :8080 app.main:app --workers 2 &'
```

### Step 2: Configure Firewall Rules

```bash
gcloud compute firewall-rules create allow-http \
  --allow tcp:80,tcp:8080 \
  --target-tags http-server \
  --description "Allow HTTP traffic"
```

### Step 3: Set Up a Systemd Service (Alternative to startup script)

For production environments, you might want to set up a proper systemd service instead of using a startup script. SSH into your VM and create a service file:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/fastapi.service
```

Add the following content:

```
[Unit]
Description=FastAPI application service
After=network.target

[Service]
User=www-data
Group=www-data
WorkingDirectory=/opt/app
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/gunicorn -k uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker -b :8080 app.main:app --workers 2
Restart=always

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Enable and start the service:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable fastapi
sudo systemctl start fastapi
```

### Step 4: Set Up Nginx (Optional)

For a production environment, you'll want to use Nginx as a reverse proxy:

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y nginx

sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/fastapi
```

Add the following configuration:

```
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name your-domain.com;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:8080;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    }
}
```

Enable the site:

```bash
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/fastapi /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

## Advanced Configuration and Best Practices

### Environment Variables

For all deployment options, you should use environment variables to manage configurations:

```python
# In your FastAPI app
import os
from pydantic_settings import BaseSettings

class Settings(BaseSettings):
    debug: bool = os.environ.get("DEBUG", "True").lower() == "true"
    database_url: str = os.environ.get("DATABASE_URL", "sqlite:///./test.db")
    
    class Config:
        env_file = ".env"

settings = Settings()

app = FastAPI(debug=settings.debug)
```

### Secret Management

For sensitive information, use Google Secret Manager:

```bash
# Create a secret
gcloud secrets create DATABASE_PASSWORD --replication-policy="automatic"

# Add a version with the secret value
echo -n "my-secure-password" | gcloud secrets versions add DATABASE_PASSWORD --data-file=-

# Grant access to your service
gcloud secrets add-iam-policy-binding DATABASE_PASSWORD \
  --member="serviceAccount:your-service-account@your-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
  --role="roles/secretmanager.secretAccessor"
```

In your FastAPI app, use the Secret Manager client:

```python
from google.cloud import secretmanager

def access_secret(project_id, secret_id, version_id="latest"):
    client = secretmanager.SecretManagerServiceClient()
    name = f"projects/{project_id}/secrets/{secret_id}/versions/{version_id}"
    response = client.access_secret_version(request={"name": name})
    return response.payload.data.decode("UTF-8")

# Example usage
db_password = access_secret("your-project-id", "DATABASE_PASSWORD")
```

### Health Checks

Implement proper health checks to help Google Cloud services determine if your application is running correctly:

```python
@app.get("/health")
async def health_check():
    # Check database connection
    try:
        # Example check for a database
        # db_connection_successful = check_db_connection()
        db_connection_successful = True
        
        if not db_connection_successful:
            return {"status": "unhealthy", "details": "Database connection failed"}, 503
            
        return {"status": "healthy", "version": "1.0.0"}
    except Exception as e:
        return {"status": "unhealthy", "details": str(e)}, 503
```

## Continuous Deployment with Cloud Build

Implement continuous deployment using Cloud Build:

1. Create a `cloudbuild.yaml` file:

```yaml
steps:
  # Build the container image
  - name: 'gcr.io/cloud-builders/docker'
    args: ['build', '-t', 'gcr.io/$PROJECT_ID/fastapi-app:$COMMIT_SHA', '.']
    
  # Push the container image to Container Registry
  - name: 'gcr.io/cloud-builders/docker'
    args: ['push', 'gcr.io/$PROJECT_ID/fastapi-app:$COMMIT_SHA']
    
  # Deploy container image to Cloud Run
  - name: 'gcr.io/google.com/cloudsdktool/cloud-sdk'
    entrypoint: gcloud
    args:
    - 'run'
    - 'deploy'
    - 'fastapi-service'
    - '--image'
    - 'gcr.io/$PROJECT_ID/fastapi-app:$COMMIT_SHA'
    - '--region'
    - 'us-central1'
    - '--platform'
    - 'managed'
    - '--allow-unauthenticated'
    
images:
  - 'gcr.io/$PROJECT_ID/fastapi-app:$COMMIT_SHA'
```

2. Set up a GitHub or GitLab trigger in Cloud Build to automatically deploy on code changes.

## Monitoring and Logging

Use Google Cloud's built-in monitoring tools:

1. Cloud Monitoring and Logging:

```python
# Add structured logging to your FastAPI app
import logging
import json
from fastapi import FastAPI, Request
from starlette.middleware.base import BaseHTTPMiddleware

app = FastAPI()

class LoggingMiddleware(BaseHTTPMiddleware):
    async def dispatch(self, request: Request, call_next):
        response = await call_next(request)
        
        log_dict = {
            "remote_addr": request.client.host,
            "method": request.method,
            "path": request.url.path,
            "status_code": response.status_code,
        }
        
        print(json.dumps(log_dict))  # Cloud Run/App Engine will capture stdout
        
        return response

app.add_middleware(LoggingMiddleware)
```

2. View logs in Google Cloud Console:
   - For Cloud Run: Navigate to Cloud Run > Your Service > Logs
   - For App Engine: Navigate to App Engine > Versions > Logs
   - For Compute Engine: Navigate to Compute Engine > VM Instances > Logs

## Summary

In this guide, we've covered three methods for deploying FastAPI applications on Google Cloud Platform:

1. **Cloud Run**: Best for containerized, serverless deployment with automatic scaling to zero.
2. **App Engine**: Simplest deployment method with good scaling and no container management.
3. **Compute Engine**: Maximum flexibility and control over your environment.

Each approach has its pros and cons, and the right choice depends on your specific requirements:
- Choose **Cloud Run** for modern, containerized workloads with variable traffic patterns
- Choose **App Engine** for the simplest deployment experience
- Choose **Compute Engine** when you need full control over the infrastructure

Remember to implement proper health checks, environment configuration, secret management, and monitoring to ensure your FastAPI application runs reliably in production.
