# FastAPI Integration Testing

## Introduction

Integration testing is a crucial aspect of building reliable FastAPI applications. Unlike unit tests that focus on individual components in isolation, integration tests verify that different parts of your application work correctly when combined. In FastAPI applications, integration tests typically involve testing API endpoints with real HTTP requests and verifying that the entire request-response flow works as expected.

In this tutorial, we'll explore how to write effective integration tests for FastAPI applications using `pytest` and FastAPI's built-in testing tools. You'll learn to simulate HTTP requests, test database interactions, and ensure your API endpoints function correctly as a complete system.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into integration testing, make sure you have:

- Basic knowledge of FastAPI
- Understanding of Python testing concepts
- Familiarity with pytest
- A FastAPI application to test

If you don't have these yet, consider reviewing the basics of FastAPI and Python testing first.

## Setting Up Your Testing Environment

Let's start by setting up the necessary tools for integration testing FastAPI applications.

### Required Packages

```bash
pip install fastapi pytest pytest-asyncio httpx
```

- `pytest`: Python testing framework
- `pytest-asyncio`: Support for testing async functions
- `httpx`: HTTP client for making requests to your FastAPI application

### Basic Project Structure

A typical FastAPI project structure for integration testing might look like:

```
├── app/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── main.py
│   ├── models.py
│   ├── routers/
│   └── dependencies.py
├── tests/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── conftest.py
│   └── test_integration.py
└── requirements.txt
```

## Creating a Test Client

FastAPI provides a `TestClient` that allows you to make HTTP requests to your application without starting a real server. Let's set this up in a `conftest.py` file to make it available to all tests:

```python
# tests/conftest.py
import pytest
from fastapi.testclient import TestClient
from app.main import app

@pytest.fixture
def client():
    with TestClient(app) as client:
        yield client
```

This fixture creates a test client that you can use to interact with your FastAPI application during tests.

## Your First Integration Test

Let's write a simple integration test for a FastAPI endpoint:

```python
# tests/test_integration.py
def test_read_main(client):
    response = client.get("/")
    assert response.status_code == 200
    assert response.json() == {"message": "Hello World"}
```

This test verifies that when you make a GET request to the root path (`/`), the API returns a 200 status code and the expected JSON response.

## Testing CRUD Operations

Now, let's write more comprehensive integration tests for a REST API with CRUD operations. We'll use a simple "items" API as an example:

```python
# tests/test_integration.py
def test_create_item(client):
    response = client.post(
        "/items/",
        json={"name": "Test Item", "description": "Test Description", "price": 10.5}
    )
    assert response.status_code == 201
    data = response.json()
    assert data["name"] == "Test Item"
    assert data["price"] == 10.5
    assert "id" in data
    return data["id"]

def test_read_item(client):
    # First, create an item to read
    item_id = test_create_item(client)
    
    # Then retrieve it
    response = client.get(f"/items/{item_id}")
    assert response.status_code == 200
    data = response.json()
    assert data["name"] == "Test Item"
    assert data["id"] == item_id

def test_update_item(client):
    # First, create an item to update
    item_id = test_create_item(client)
    
    # Then update it
    response = client.put(
        f"/items/{item_id}",
        json={"name": "Updated Item", "description": "Updated Description", "price": 20.0}
    )
    assert response.status_code == 200
    data = response.json()
    assert data["name"] == "Updated Item"
    assert data["price"] == 20.0

def test_delete_item(client):
    # First, create an item to delete
    item_id = test_create_item(client)
    
    # Then delete it
    response = client.delete(f"/items/{item_id}")
    assert response.status_code == 204
    
    # Verify it's gone
    response = client.get(f"/items/{item_id}")
    assert response.status_code == 404
```

## Testing with Database Dependencies

Integration tests for FastAPI applications often need to interact with databases. Let's see how to set up integration tests with a database:

### Setting Up a Test Database

```python
# tests/conftest.py
import pytest
from fastapi.testclient import TestClient
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker
from sqlalchemy.pool import StaticPool

from app.main import app
from app.database import Base, get_db

# Create a test database in memory
SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URL = "sqlite:///:memory:"

engine = create_engine(
    SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URL,
    connect_args={"check_same_thread": False},
    poolclass=StaticPool,
)
TestingSessionLocal = sessionmaker(autocommit=False, autoflush=False, bind=engine)

@pytest.fixture(scope="function")
def db():
    # Create the database
    Base.metadata.create_all(bind=engine)
    
    # Create a database session
    db = TestingSessionLocal()
    try:
        yield db
    finally:
        db.close()
        
    # Clean up tables after the test
    Base.metadata.drop_all(bind=engine)

@pytest.fixture
def client(db):
    # Override the get_db dependency
    def override_get_db():
        try:
            yield db
        finally:
            pass
    
    app.dependency_overrides[get_db] = override_get_db
    
    with TestClient(app) as client:
        yield client
    
    # Clean up the override after the test
    app.dependency_overrides = {}
```

This setup:
1. Creates an in-memory SQLite database for testing
2. Sets up a database fixture that creates and cleans up tables for each test
3. Overrides the application's database dependency to use our test database

### Testing Database Operations

Now let's test endpoints that interact with the database:

```python
# tests/test_integration.py
def test_create_user(client):
    response = client.post(
        "/users/",
        json={"email": "test@example.com", "password": "password123"}
    )
    assert response.status_code == 201
    data = response.json()
    assert data["email"] == "test@example.com"
    assert "id" in data
    
def test_get_users(client):
    # Create some test users first
    client.post("/users/", json={"email": "user1@example.com", "password": "password123"})
    client.post("/users/", json={"email": "user2@example.com", "password": "password123"})
    
    # Test getting all users
    response = client.get("/users/")
    assert response.status_code == 200
    data = response.json()
    assert len(data) == 2
    assert data[0]["email"] == "user1@example.com"
    assert data[1]["email"] == "user2@example.com"
```

## Testing Authentication and Protected Routes

Integration tests should also verify that authentication and authorization work correctly:

```python
# tests/test_integration.py
def test_login_and_protected_route(client):
    # First create a user
    client.post(
        "/users/",
        json={"email": "auth_test@example.com", "password": "securepassword"}
    )
    
    # Login to get access token
    login_response = client.post(
        "/token",
        data={"username": "auth_test@example.com", "password": "securepassword"}
    )
    assert login_response.status_code == 200
    token_data = login_response.json()
    assert "access_token" in token_data
    access_token = token_data["access_token"]
    
    # Access protected route with token
    headers = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {access_token}"}
    protected_response = client.get("/users/me", headers=headers)
    assert protected_response.status_code == 200
    user_data = protected_response.json()
    assert user_data["email"] == "auth_test@example.com"
    
    # Try accessing without token (should fail)
    no_auth_response = client.get("/users/me")
    assert no_auth_response.status_code == 401
```

## Testing File Uploads

If your API supports file uploads, you can test them like this:

```python
# tests/test_integration.py
def test_file_upload(client):
    # Create a test file
    test_file_content = b"This is a test file content"
    files = {"file": ("test.txt", test_file_content, "text/plain")}
    
    # Upload the file
    response = client.post("/uploadfile/", files=files)
    assert response.status_code == 200
    data = response.json()
    assert data["filename"] == "test.txt"
    assert data["content_type"] == "text/plain"
    assert "file_size" in data
```

## Testing Error Handling

It's important to test how your API handles errors:

```python
# tests/test_integration.py
def test_not_found_error(client):
    response = client.get("/nonexistent-endpoint")
    assert response.status_code == 404
    
def test_validation_error(client):
    response = client.post(
        "/items/",
        json={"name": "Invalid Item", "price": "not-a-number"}  # price should be a number
    )
    assert response.status_code == 422  # Unprocessable Entity
    error_data = response.json()
    assert "detail" in error_data
```

## Real-World Example: Testing a Blog API

Let's create a comprehensive integration test for a blog API:

```python
# tests/test_blog_integration.py
import pytest

@pytest.fixture
def user_token(client):
    # Create a test user
    client.post(
        "/users/",
        json={"email": "blogger@example.com", "password": "blogpassword"}
    )
    
    # Login to get token
    response = client.post(
        "/token",
        data={"username": "blogger@example.com", "password": "blogpassword"}
    )
    return response.json()["access_token"]

def test_blog_workflow(client, user_token):
    headers = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {user_token}"}
    
    # 1. Create a new blog post
    create_response = client.post(
        "/posts/",
        headers=headers,
        json={
            "title": "Integration Testing with FastAPI",
            "content": "This is a test blog post about integration testing...",
            "published": True
        }
    )
    assert create_response.status_code == 201
    post_data = create_response.json()
    post_id = post_data["id"]
    
    # 2. Get the created post
    get_response = client.get(f"/posts/{post_id}")
    assert get_response.status_code == 200
    assert get_response.json()["title"] == "Integration Testing with FastAPI"
    
    # 3. Update the post
    update_response = client.put(
        f"/posts/{post_id}",
        headers=headers,
        json={
            "title": "Updated: Integration Testing with FastAPI",
            "content": "This content has been updated",
            "published": True
        }
    )
    assert update_response.status_code == 200
    assert update_response.json()["title"] == "Updated: Integration Testing with FastAPI"
    
    # 4. Add a comment to the post
    comment_response = client.post(
        f"/posts/{post_id}/comments",
        headers=headers,
        json={"content": "Great article about testing!"}
    )
    assert comment_response.status_code == 201
    comment_id = comment_response.json()["id"]
    
    # 5. Get all comments for the post
    comments_response = client.get(f"/posts/{post_id}/comments")
    assert comments_response.status_code == 200
    comments = comments_response.json()
    assert len(comments) == 1
    assert comments[0]["content"] == "Great article about testing!"
    
    # 6. Delete the comment
    delete_comment_response = client.delete(
        f"/comments/{comment_id}",
        headers=headers
    )
    assert delete_comment_response.status_code == 204
    
    # 7. Delete the post
    delete_post_response = client.delete(
        f"/posts/{post_id}",
        headers=headers
    )
    assert delete_post_response.status_code == 204
    
    # 8. Verify the post is gone
    get_deleted_response = client.get(f"/posts/{post_id}")
    assert get_deleted_response.status_code == 404
```

This test walks through a complete workflow for a blog API, testing the creation, reading, updating, and deletion of posts and comments.

## Best Practices for FastAPI Integration Testing

1. **Isolate tests**: Each test should be independent and not rely on the state from other tests.

2. **Use fixtures efficiently**: Create fixtures for common setup tasks like authentication or data creation.

3. **Test the happy path and edge cases**: Don't just test when everything works - test error conditions too.

4. **Clean up after tests**: Ensure your tests clean up any resources they create, especially database records.

5. **Use parameterized tests** for testing similar functionality with different inputs:

```python
@pytest.mark.parametrize("item_data,expected_status_code", [
    ({"name": "Valid Item", "price": 10.5}, 201),
    ({"name": "Invalid Item", "price": -10.5}, 422),  # negative price
    ({"price": 10.5}, 422),  # missing name
])
def test_create_item_validation(client, item_data, expected_status_code):
    response = client.post("/items/", json=item_data)
    assert response.status_code == expected_status_code
```

6. **Use proper assertions**: Be specific about what you're testing and provide clear error messages.

7. **Test middleware and dependencies**: Don't forget to test application-wide features.

## Running Integration Tests

To run your tests with pytest, use the following command:

```bash
pytest tests/test_integration.py -v
```

Add the `-v` flag for verbose output, which shows the name of each test as it runs.
