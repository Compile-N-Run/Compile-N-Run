# FastAPI Pytest Fixtures

When testing FastAPI applications, pytest fixtures are incredibly powerful tools that help you set up test environments, reuse components, and write cleaner test code. In this guide, we'll explore how to effectively use pytest fixtures with FastAPI to create robust test suites.

## Understanding Pytest Fixtures

Pytest fixtures are functions that create data, test doubles, or initialize system state for test functions. Their main purpose is to provide a fixed baseline for tests to run reliably and consistently.

### Why Use Fixtures in FastAPI Testing?

- **Reusability**: Create test components once and reuse them across multiple tests
- **Clean setup and teardown**: Automatically handle resources before and after tests
- **Modularity**: Break complex test setups into manageable components
- **Database isolation**: Test database operations without affecting production data
- **Performance**: Share expensive setup operations between tests

## Basic FastAPI Test Fixtures

Let's start with the most common fixture you'll need when testing FastAPI applications - the test client.

### Creating a Test Client Fixture

```python
import pytest
from fastapi.testclient import TestClient
from myapp.main import app  # Import your FastAPI app

@pytest.fixture
def client():
    """
    Create a test client for our FastAPI application.
    """
    return TestClient(app)
```

This fixture creates a FastAPI `TestClient` that will allow us to make requests to our application without actually running a server.

### Using the Client Fixture

```python
def test_read_root(client):
    """Test the root endpoint returns the expected response."""
    response = client.get("/")
    assert response.status_code == 200
    assert response.json() == {"message": "Welcome to my API!"}
```

## Database Fixtures

When testing API endpoints that interact with a database, you'll need fixtures to set up test databases and seed them with data.

### Creating a Test Database Fixture

Here's how to create a SQLAlchemy test database fixture:

```python
import pytest
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker
from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base

from myapp.database import Base, get_db
from myapp.main import app

@pytest.fixture
def engine():
    """Create a SQLAlchemy engine for the test database."""
    # Use in-memory SQLite for testing
    engine = create_engine("sqlite:///./test.db", connect_args={"check_same_thread": False})
    Base.metadata.create_all(bind=engine)
    yield engine
    Base.metadata.drop_all(bind=engine)

@pytest.fixture
def db_session(engine):
    """Create a SQLAlchemy session for the test database."""
    TestingSessionLocal = sessionmaker(autocommit=False, autoflush=False, bind=engine)
    db = TestingSessionLocal()
    try:
        yield db
    finally:
        db.close()

@pytest.fixture
def client(db_session):
    """Override the default database with the test database."""
    def override_get_db():
        try:
            yield db_session
        finally:
            pass
    
    # Use the test database instead of the production database
    app.dependency_overrides[get_db] = override_get_db
    
    with TestClient(app) as c:
        yield c
    
    # Clear dependency overrides after tests
    app.dependency_overrides = {}
```

### Test Data Fixtures

You'll often need to populate your test database with sample data:

```python
@pytest.fixture
def sample_user(db_session):
    """Create a sample user in the test database."""
    from myapp.models import User
    from myapp.security import get_password_hash
    
    user = User(
        username="testuser",
        email="test@example.com",
        hashed_password=get_password_hash("password123")
    )
    
    db_session.add(user)
    db_session.commit()
    db_session.refresh(user)
    
    yield user
    
    # Clean up (optional if using an isolated test database)
    db_session.query(User).filter(User.username == "testuser").delete()
    db_session.commit()
```

## Advanced Fixture Techniques

Let's look at some more advanced patterns for working with fixtures in FastAPI tests.

### Authentication Fixtures

For APIs requiring authentication, you'll need fixtures to generate valid tokens:

```python
@pytest.fixture
def token_header(sample_user):
    """Generate a valid authentication token for the sample user."""
    from myapp.security import create_access_token
    
    access_token = create_access_token(data={"sub": sample_user.email})
    return {"Authorization": f"Bearer {access_token}"}

@pytest.fixture
def authenticated_client(client, token_header):
    """Client that includes authentication headers with each request."""
    client.headers.update(token_header)
    return client
```

Using the authenticated client fixture:

```python
def test_read_users_me(authenticated_client):
    """Test the endpoint that returns information about the current user."""
    response = authenticated_client.get("/users/me")
    assert response.status_code == 200
    assert response.json()["email"] == "test@example.com"
```

### Mocking External Services

When your API depends on external services, you'll want to mock them in your tests:

```python
@pytest.fixture
def mock_weather_service(monkeypatch):
    """Mock an external weather service API."""
    def mock_get_weather(*args, **kwargs):
        return {
            "temperature": 25.0,
            "humidity": 60,
            "description": "Sunny"
        }
    
    # Assuming your app has a get_weather function that calls the external API
    from myapp.services import weather
    monkeypatch.setattr(weather, "get_weather", mock_get_weather)
```

## Organizing Fixtures with Conftest.py

For larger applications, you'll want to organize your fixtures in a `conftest.py` file. This file is automatically recognized by pytest, and its fixtures become available to all test files in the same directory and subdirectories.

Create a `tests/conftest.py` file:

```python
# tests/conftest.py
import pytest
from fastapi.testclient import TestClient
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker

from myapp.main import app
from myapp.database import Base, get_db
# ... include all your fixtures here
```

## Parameterized Fixtures

You can create parameterized fixtures to test multiple scenarios:

```python
@pytest.fixture(params=[
    {"username": "user1", "is_admin": False},
    {"username": "admin1", "is_admin": True}
])
def test_user(request, db_session):
    """Create different types of test users."""
    from myapp.models import User
    from myapp.security import get_password_hash
    
    user = User(
        username=request.param["username"],
        email=f"{request.param['username']}@example.com",
        hashed_password=get_password_hash("password123"),
        is_admin=request.param["is_admin"]
    )
    
    db_session.add(user)
    db_session.commit()
    db_session.refresh(user)
    
    yield user
    
    # Cleanup
    db_session.delete(user)
    db_session.commit()
```

## Real-world Testing Example

Let's put everything together in a comprehensive example:

```python
# tests/test_items.py
import pytest
from myapp.models import Item, User

# Test item creation
def test_create_item(authenticated_client, db_session):
    response = authenticated_client.post(
        "/items/",
        json={"title": "Test Item", "description": "This is a test item"}
    )
    assert response.status_code == 201
    result = response.json()
    assert result["title"] == "Test Item"
    
    # Verify the item was actually created in the database
    db_item = db_session.query(Item).filter(Item.id == result["id"]).first()
    assert db_item is not None
    assert db_item.title == "Test Item"

# Test permission-based access
def test_item_access(client, db_session, test_user):
    # Create an item owned by the test user
    item = Item(title="Private Item", owner_id=test_user.id)
    db_session.add(item)
    db_session.commit()
    
    if test_user.is_admin:
        # Admins can access any item
        response = client.get(f"/items/{item.id}")
        assert response.status_code == 200
    else:
        # Non-authenticated users can't access private items
        response = client.get(f"/items/{item.id}")
        assert response.status_code == 401 or response.status_code == 403
```

## Best Practices for FastAPI Test Fixtures

1. **Keep fixtures focused**: Each fixture should serve a single purpose
2. **Use appropriate scopes**: Use `scope="function"` for isolation, `scope="module"` for performance
3. **Clean up resources**: Ensure that fixtures properly clean up after themselves
4. **Use dependency overrides**: Replace real dependencies with test versions
5. **Separate test concerns**: Use different fixtures for different aspects of your application
6. **Make fixtures reusable**: Design fixtures that can be composed together
7. **Avoid unnecessary mocking**: Only mock what you need to

## Common Fixture Scopes

Pytest supports different scopes for fixtures:

```python
@pytest.fixture(scope="function")  # Default: runs once per test function
def function_fixture():
    # Setup
    yield resource
    # Teardown

@pytest.fixture(scope="class")  # Runs once per test class
def class_fixture():
    yield resource

@pytest.fixture(scope="module")  # Runs once per test module (file)
def module_fixture():
    yield resource

@pytest.fixture(scope="session")  # Runs once per test session
def session_fixture():
    yield resource
```

## Summary

Pytest fixtures provide a powerful way to organize and reuse test components in your FastAPI applications. By creating fixtures for common needs like test clients, database sessions, authentication tokens, and mock services, you can write cleaner, more maintainable tests.

Remember to keep your fixtures focused, appropriately scoped, and organized in a way that makes sense for your application. With well-designed fixtures, testing your FastAPI application becomes more manageable and enjoyable.
