# FastAPI Dependency Testing

In FastAPI applications, dependencies play a crucial role in organizing code, handling authentication, managing database connections, and more. Testing these dependencies properly ensures your application remains robust and reliable. This guide will walk you through effective strategies for testing FastAPI dependencies.

## Introduction to Testing Dependencies

When building FastAPI applications with dependency injection, testing becomes both important and potentially complex. Dependencies might connect to databases, external APIs, or perform other operations that shouldn't run during tests. Proper testing strategy helps you:

- Isolate the code being tested
- Avoid making real external calls
- Test error scenarios without causing actual errors
- Make tests run faster and more reliably

## Basic Concepts of Dependency Testing

### Types of Dependencies to Test

In FastAPI, you'll typically need to test these types of dependencies:

1. **Simple dependencies** - Functions that return values
2. **Class dependencies** - Classes with `__call__` methods
3. **Nested dependencies** - Dependencies that depend on other dependencies
4. **Dependencies with yields** - For setup/teardown operations

## Testing Simple Dependencies

Let's start with testing a simple dependency function:

```python
# app/dependencies.py
async def get_current_user(token: str = Depends(oauth2_scheme)):
    user = await verify_token(token)
    if not user:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=401, detail="Invalid authentication credentials")
    return user
```

To test this dependency, you'll need to mock the `verify_token` function and test both success and failure cases:

```python
# tests/test_dependencies.py
from unittest.mock import patch, AsyncMock
import pytest
from fastapi import HTTPException
from app.dependencies import get_current_user

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_get_current_user_valid():
    # Mock the verify_token function to return a user
    with patch("app.dependencies.verify_token", new_callable=AsyncMock) as mock_verify:
        mock_verify.return_value = {"id": 1, "username": "testuser"}
        
        # Call the dependency function
        user = await get_current_user("valid_token")
        
        # Assert the function returns the expected user
        assert user["id"] == 1
        assert user["username"] == "testuser"
        
        # Assert verify_token was called with the correct token
        mock_verify.assert_called_once_with("valid_token")

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_get_current_user_invalid():
    # Mock the verify_token function to return None (invalid token)
    with patch("app.dependencies.verify_token", new_callable=AsyncMock) as mock_verify:
        mock_verify.return_value = None
        
        # Test that the function raises an HTTPException for invalid token
        with pytest.raises(HTTPException) as excinfo:
            await get_current_user("invalid_token")
        
        # Verify the exception details
        assert excinfo.value.status_code == 401
        assert "Invalid authentication credentials" in excinfo.value.detail
```

## Testing Class-based Dependencies

When testing class-based dependencies, you'll need to create instances of the class and test their `__call__` method:

```python
# app/dependencies.py
class DatabaseDependency:
    def __init__(self):
        self.connection = None

    async def __call__(self):
        self.connection = await create_db_connection()
        try:
            yield self.connection
        finally:
            await self.connection.close()

db_dependency = DatabaseDependency()
```

The test might look like:

```python
# tests/test_dependencies.py
@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_db_dependency():
    # Create mocks for the connection
    mock_connection = AsyncMock()
    
    # Mock the create_db_connection function
    with patch("app.dependencies.create_db_connection", new_callable=AsyncMock) as mock_create:
        mock_create.return_value = mock_connection
        
        # Create an instance of the dependency
        db_dep = DatabaseDependency()
        
        # Use it in a context manager to test the yield behavior
        async for conn in db_dep():
            # Test that the connection is the mock connection
            assert conn is mock_connection
            # Do some operations with the connection
            conn.execute.return_value = ["result1", "result2"]
            result = await conn.execute("SELECT * FROM table")
            assert result == ["result1", "result2"]
        
        # Test that connection.close was called
        mock_connection.close.assert_called_once()
```

## Testing Nested Dependencies

Testing nested dependencies requires careful mocking of each layer. Let's consider this example:

```python
# app/dependencies.py
async def get_db_connection():
    connection = await create_db_connection()
    try:
        yield connection
    finally:
        await connection.close()

async def get_user_repository(db=Depends(get_db_connection)):
    return UserRepository(db)

async def get_current_user(
    token: str = Depends(oauth2_scheme),
    user_repo=Depends(get_user_repository)
):
    user_id = decode_token(token)
    user = await user_repo.get_by_id(user_id)
    if not user:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="User not found")
    return user
```

You can test it like this:

```python
@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_get_current_user_nested():
    # Create a mock user repository
    mock_user_repo = AsyncMock()
    mock_user_repo.get_by_id.return_value = {"id": 1, "username": "testuser"}
    
    # Mock the decode_token function
    with patch("app.dependencies.decode_token") as mock_decode:
        mock_decode.return_value = 1  # User ID
        
        # Test the get_current_user function with a mocked user_repo
        user = await get_current_user("fake_token", mock_user_repo)
        
        # Assertions
        assert user["id"] == 1
        assert user["username"] == "testuser"
        mock_user_repo.get_by_id.assert_called_once_with(1)
```

## Integration Testing with TestClient

While unit testing individual dependencies is important, you should also test them integrated into your endpoints:

```python
# tests/test_integration.py
from fastapi.testclient import TestClient
from unittest.mock import patch, AsyncMock
from app.main import app

client = TestClient(app)

def test_protected_endpoint():
    # Mock the dependency directly in the app
    with patch("app.main.get_current_user", return_value={"id": 1, "username": "testuser"}):
        response = client.get("/protected-endpoint")
        assert response.status_code == 200
        assert "message" in response.json()

def test_protected_endpoint_unauthorized():
    # Mock the dependency to raise an HTTPException
    with patch("app.main.get_current_user", side_effect=HTTPException(status_code=401)):
        response = client.get("/protected-endpoint")
        assert response.status_code == 401
```

## Using Override_dependency for Testing

FastAPI provides a powerful way to override dependencies for testing using `app.dependency_overrides`:

```python
# tests/test_override.py
from fastapi.testclient import TestClient
from app.main import app

client = TestClient(app)

async def override_get_current_user():
    # This will be used instead of the real dependency
    return {"id": 1, "username": "testuser"}

def test_with_override():
    # Set up dependency override
    app.dependency_overrides[get_current_user] = override_get_current_user
    
    # Make the request
    response = client.get("/protected-endpoint")
    
    # Assertions
    assert response.status_code == 200
    
    # Clean up after test
    app.dependency_overrides = {}
```

## Testing Dependencies with Yields

For dependencies that yield values (like database connections), you need to test both the setup and teardown logic:

```python
@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_dependency_with_yield():
    mock_conn = AsyncMock()
    
    with patch("app.dependencies.create_connection", return_value=mock_conn):
        # Use the dependency in an async for loop to capture the yielded value
        dep_gen = get_db_connection()
        connection = await dep_gen.__anext__()
        
        # Test the yielded connection
        assert connection == mock_conn
        
        # Test cleanup by calling __anext__ until it raises StopAsyncIteration
        try:
            await dep_gen.__anext__()
            assert False, "Expected StopAsyncIteration"
        except StopAsyncIteration:
            # Make sure the connection was closed
            mock_conn.close.assert_called_once()
```

## Creating Test Fixtures for Dependencies

Using pytest fixtures can make dependency testing more organized:

```python
# tests/conftest.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import AsyncMock, patch

@pytest.fixture
def mock_db_connection():
    """Fixture for database connection dependency"""
    mock_conn = AsyncMock()
    mock_conn.execute.return_value = {"result": "data"}
    return mock_conn

@pytest.fixture
def override_db_dependency(mock_db_connection):
    """Fixture to override database dependency in the app"""
    async def override():
        yield mock_db_connection
        
    from app.main import app
    from app.dependencies import get_db_connection
    
    # Set the override
    app.dependency_overrides[get_db_connection] = override
    
    yield mock_db_connection
    
    # Clean up after test
    app.dependency_overrides = {}
```

Then in your tests:

```python
# tests/test_endpoints.py
def test_user_endpoint(client, override_db_dependency):
    # The db dependency is already overridden
    response = client.get("/users/1")
    assert response.status_code == 200
    # Check that the mock was used
    override_db_dependency.execute.assert_called_once()
```

## Real-world Example: Testing Authentication Dependencies

Let's look at a complete example for a common use case - testing JWT authentication:

```python
# app/auth.py
from fastapi import Depends, HTTPException, Security
from fastapi.security import HTTPBearer, HTTPAuthorizationCredentials
import jwt
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

security = HTTPBearer()
SECRET_KEY = "your_secret_key"
ALGORITHM = "HS256"

def create_access_token(data: dict, expires_delta: timedelta = timedelta(minutes=15)):
    to_encode = data.copy()
    expire = datetime.utcnow() + expires_delta
    to_encode.update({"exp": expire})
    encoded_jwt = jwt.encode(to_encode, SECRET_KEY, algorithm=ALGORITHM)
    return encoded_jwt

async def get_current_user(credentials: HTTPAuthorizationCredentials = Security(security)):
    try:
        payload = jwt.decode(credentials.credentials, SECRET_KEY, algorithms=[ALGORITHM])
        username: str = payload.get("sub")
        if username is None:
            raise HTTPException(status_code=401, detail="Invalid authentication credentials")
    except jwt.PyJWTError:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=401, detail="Invalid authentication token")
    
    # Here you would typically load the user from a database
    user = {"username": username, "is_active": True}
    if not user["is_active"]:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail="Inactive user")
    return user
```

Here's how to test it:

```python
# tests/test_auth.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch
import jwt
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
from fastapi import HTTPException
from fastapi.security import HTTPAuthorizationCredentials
from app.auth import get_current_user, create_access_token, SECRET_KEY, ALGORITHM

# Test creating tokens
def test_create_access_token():
    data = {"sub": "testuser"}
    token = create_access_token(data)
    payload = jwt.decode(token, SECRET_KEY, algorithms=[ALGORITHM])
    
    # Check token content
    assert payload["sub"] == "testuser"
    assert "exp" in payload
    
    # Check expiration time is approximately 15 minutes in the future
    exp_time = datetime.fromtimestamp(payload["exp"])
    now_plus_15 = datetime.utcnow() + timedelta(minutes=15)
    assert abs((exp_time - now_plus_15).total_seconds()) < 10  # Within 10 seconds

# Test authentication succeeding
@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_get_current_user_valid():
    # Create a valid token
    token = create_access_token({"sub": "testuser"})
    
    # Create credentials object
    credentials = HTTPAuthorizationCredentials(scheme="Bearer", credentials=token)
    
    # Call the dependency function
    user = await get_current_user(credentials)
    
    # Check the returned user
    assert user["username"] == "testuser"
    assert user["is_active"] == True

# Test authentication failing with invalid token
@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_get_current_user_invalid_token():
    # Create invalid credentials
    credentials = HTTPAuthorizationCredentials(scheme="Bearer", credentials="invalid-token")
    
    # Test exception is raised
    with pytest.raises(HTTPException) as excinfo:
        await get_current_user(credentials)
    
    # Check exception details
    assert excinfo.value.status_code == 401
    assert "Invalid authentication token" in excinfo.value.detail

# Test authentication failing with token missing 'sub' claim
@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_get_current_user_missing_sub():
    # Create a token with no 'sub' claim
    token = create_access_token({"data": "no-username"})
    
    # Create credentials object
    credentials = HTTPAuthorizationCredentials(scheme="Bearer", credentials=token)
    
    # Test exception is raised
    with pytest.raises(HTTPException) as excinfo:
        await get_current_user(credentials)
    
    # Check exception details
    assert excinfo.value.status_code == 401
    assert "Invalid authentication credentials" in excinfo.value.detail
```

## Summary

Testing dependencies in FastAPI applications requires:

1. **Isolation** - Mock external services and dependencies
2. **Coverage** - Test both success and failure conditions
3. **Structure** - Use fixtures to organize tests
4. **Integration** - Test how dependencies work within endpoints

Effective testing strategies include:
- Using `unittest.mock` to patch functions and methods
- Creating pytest fixtures for common test scenarios
- Using `app.dependency_overrides` to replace dependencies
- Testing both setup and teardown for dependencies with yields

By thoroughly testing your dependencies, you ensure your FastAPI application remains robust, secure, and maintainable as it grows in complexity.
