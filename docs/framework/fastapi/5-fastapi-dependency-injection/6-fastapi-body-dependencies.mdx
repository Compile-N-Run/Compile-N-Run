# FastAPI Body Dependencies

When building APIs with FastAPI, you'll often need to process and validate data from request bodies. FastAPI's powerful dependency injection system can be integrated with request bodies to create cleaner, more maintainable code. This article explores how to leverage body dependencies in FastAPI applications.

## Introduction to Body Dependencies

Body dependencies are a way to use FastAPI's dependency injection system with request body parameters. They allow you to:

- Extract and validate specific fields from the request body
- Reuse body validation logic across multiple endpoints
- Organize your code better with separation of concerns
- Implement custom processing for request body data

## Basic Request Body Handling

Before diving into body dependencies, let's review how standard request body handling works in FastAPI:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from pydantic import BaseModel

app = FastAPI()

class User(BaseModel):
    username: str
    email: str
    full_name: str = None

@app.post("/users/")
async def create_user(user: User):
    return {"user": user.dict()}
```

This works well for simple cases, but as your API grows in complexity, you might need more sophisticated ways to handle request bodies.

## Creating Body Dependencies

Body dependencies in FastAPI allow you to declare dependencies that work with request body data. Here's how to create them:

### Method 1: Using Depends with Pydantic Models

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, Depends, Body
from pydantic import BaseModel, EmailStr, validator
from typing import Optional

app = FastAPI()

class UserCredentials(BaseModel):
    username: str
    password: str
    
    @validator('username')
    def username_must_be_valid(cls, v):
        if len(v) < 3:
            raise ValueError('Username must be at least 3 characters long')
        return v
    
    @validator('password')
    def password_must_be_strong(cls, v):
        if len(v) < 8:
            raise ValueError('Password must be at least 8 characters long')
        # Add more validation as needed
        return v

def get_validated_user_credentials(credentials: UserCredentials):
    # You could add additional validation or processing here
    # For example, checking if username already exists in database
    return credentials

@app.post("/register/")
async def register_user(credentials: UserCredentials = Depends(get_validated_user_credentials)):
    # Use the validated credentials
    return {
        "username": credentials.username,
        "message": "User registered successfully"
    }
```

### Method 2: Using Body Parameters with Dependencies

You can also extract specific fields from the request body:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, Depends, Body
from typing import Optional

app = FastAPI()

def validate_name(name: str = Body(...)):
    if len(name) < 2:
        raise ValueError("Name too short")
    return name.title()  # Return capitalized name

def validate_age(age: int = Body(...)):
    if age < 18:
        raise ValueError("Must be at least 18 years old")
    return age

@app.post("/profile/")
async def create_profile(
    name: str = Depends(validate_name),
    age: int = Depends(validate_age),
    bio: Optional[str] = Body(None)
):
    return {
        "name": name,
        "age": age,
        "bio": bio,
        "profile": f"{name}, {age} years old"
    }
```

## Nested Body Dependencies

For more complex scenarios, you might need to work with nested data. FastAPI handles this elegantly:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, Depends, Body
from pydantic import BaseModel
from typing import List

app = FastAPI()

class Address(BaseModel):
    street: str
    city: str
    country: str
    postal_code: str

class User(BaseModel):
    name: str
    addresses: List[Address]

def extract_primary_address(user: User = Body(...)):
    if not user.addresses:
        raise ValueError("User must have at least one address")
    return user.addresses[0]

@app.post("/users/primary-address/")
async def get_primary_address(primary_address: Address = Depends(extract_primary_address)):
    return {
        "primary_address": primary_address,
        "formatted": f"{primary_address.street}, {primary_address.city}, {primary_address.country}"
    }
```

## Real-world Example: Form Data Validation and Processing

Let's look at a practical example of using body dependencies for form submission:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, Depends, Body, Form, HTTPException
from pydantic import BaseModel, EmailStr, validator
from typing import Optional
import re

app = FastAPI()

# For JSON request body
class ContactForm(BaseModel):
    name: str
    email: EmailStr
    message: str
    subject: Optional[str] = None
    
    @validator('name')
    def name_must_be_valid(cls, v):
        if len(v) < 2:
            raise ValueError('Name must be at least 2 characters')
        return v
        
    @validator('message')
    def message_not_empty(cls, v):
        if len(v.strip()) == 0:
            raise ValueError('Message cannot be empty')
        return v

# Dependency for validating spam content
def validate_no_spam(form: ContactForm):
    spam_patterns = [
        r"buy now",
        r"free money",
        r"lottery winner",
        # Add more patterns as needed
    ]
    
    for pattern in spam_patterns:
        if re.search(pattern, form.message, re.IGNORECASE):
            raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail="Spam content detected")
    
    return form

# Dependency for sanitizing content
def sanitize_form(form: ContactForm = Depends(validate_no_spam)):
    # Sanitize inputs - simple example
    form.name = form.name.strip()
    form.email = form.email.lower().strip()
    form.message = form.message.strip()
    
    if form.subject:
        form.subject = form.subject.strip()
    else:
        form.subject = "General Inquiry"  # Set default subject
        
    return form

@app.post("/contact/")
async def submit_contact_form(form: ContactForm = Depends(sanitize_form)):
    # Process the sanitized, validated contact form
    # In a real app, you might save to a database or send an email
    
    return {
        "status": "success",
        "message": "Thank you for your submission!",
        "data": {
            "name": form.name,
            "email": form.email,
            "subject": form.subject,
            "message_preview": f"{form.message[:50]}..."
        }
    }
```

This example demonstrates a practical use case where multiple dependencies work together to validate and sanitize a contact form submission.

## Benefits of Body Dependencies

Using body dependencies offers several advantages:

1. **Code Reusability**: Define validation once, use it across multiple endpoints
2. **Separation of Concerns**: Keep validation logic separate from endpoint logic
3. **Testability**: Dependencies are easier to test in isolation
4. **Maintainability**: When validation rules change, you only need to update in one place
5. **Readability**: Endpoint functions remain clean and focused on their core purpose

## Advanced Techniques

### Combining Path, Query and Body Dependencies

You can combine different types of dependencies in a single endpoint:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, Depends, Body, Path, Query
from pydantic import BaseModel
from typing import Optional

app = FastAPI()

class Item(BaseModel):
    name: str
    description: Optional[str] = None
    price: float
    tax: Optional[float] = None

def validate_item_price(item: Item = Body(...)):
    if item.price <= 0:
        raise ValueError("Price must be positive")
    return item

def get_user_by_id(user_id: int = Path(...)):
    # In a real app, you'd fetch from a database
    return {"user_id": user_id, "name": "Test User"}

def check_admin_access(is_admin: bool = Query(False)):
    if not is_admin:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=403, detail="Admin access required")
    return is_admin

@app.post("/users/{user_id}/items/")
async def create_item_for_user(
    user: dict = Depends(get_user_by_id),
    item: Item = Depends(validate_item_price),
    is_admin: bool = Depends(check_admin_access)
):
    return {
        "user": user,
        "item": item,
        "admin_access": is_admin
    }
```

### Using Dependencies with Background Tasks

You can use body dependencies to set up background tasks:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, Depends, BackgroundTasks
from pydantic import BaseModel, EmailStr

app = FastAPI()

class EmailContent(BaseModel):
    email: EmailStr
    subject: str
    content: str

def validate_email_content(email_content: EmailContent):
    # Validate email content here
    return email_content

def send_email_background(email: str, subject: str, content: str):
    # This would be your actual email sending logic
    print(f"Sending email to {email} with subject: {subject}")
    # Implementation omitted for brevity

@app.post("/send-email/")
async def send_email(
    background_tasks: BackgroundTasks,
    email_content: EmailContent = Depends(validate_email_content)
):
    # Add the email sending as a background task
    background_tasks.add_task(
        send_email_background,
        email_content.email,
        email_content.subject,
        email_content.content
    )
    
    return {"message": "Email will be sent in the background"}
```

## Summary

FastAPI body dependencies are a powerful tool for creating clean, maintainable APIs. They allow you to:

- Validate request body data with reusable functions
- Extract and process specific fields from request bodies
- Chain multiple validation and processing steps together
- Create more maintainable code by separating validation from business logic

As you build more complex APIs with FastAPI, body dependencies will become an essential part of your toolkit for keeping your code organized and your endpoints focused on their core functionality.
