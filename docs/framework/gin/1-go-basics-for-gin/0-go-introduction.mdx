# Go Introduction

Welcome to the exciting world of Go programming! This guide introduces you to Go (or Golang), a powerful language developed by Google that's perfect for building modern web applications. As part of our "Go Basics for Gin" series, this introduction will lay the foundation for your journey into building web applications with the Gin framework.

## What is Go?

Go is an open-source programming language developed by Google engineers Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson in 2007 and released to the public in 2009. It was designed to address the challenges faced by developers at Google who were working with large-scale systems.

Go combines the efficiency of a compiled language with the ease of programming similar to interpreted languages. It features:

- **Fast compilation and execution speed**
- **Built-in concurrency** through goroutines and channels
- **Garbage collection** for automatic memory management
- **Statically typed** for type safety
- **Simplicity and readability** as design principles

## Why Learn Go for Web Development?

Before diving into the Gin framework, understanding Go is essential because:

1. **Performance**: Go is exceptionally fast and efficient, making it perfect for web servers
2. **Concurrency**: Go's goroutines make it easy to handle thousands of simultaneous connections
3. **Simplicity**: Go's syntax is clean and straightforward, reducing the learning curve
4. **Strong Standard Library**: Go includes powerful packages for web development out of the box
5. **Growing Ecosystem**: Many frameworks like Gin build upon Go's solid foundation

## Setting Up Your Go Environment

Before writing any code, let's set up your Go development environment:

### 1. Install Go

Visit the [official Go website](https://golang.org/dl/) and download the installer for your operating system. Follow the installation instructions.

### 2. Verify Installation

After installation, open your terminal or command prompt and run:

```bash
go version
```

You should see output similar to:

```
go version go1.20.2 darwin/amd64
```

### 3. Set Up Your Workspace

Go has a unique workspace structure. Create a directory for your Go projects:

```bash
mkdir -p $HOME/go/{bin,src,pkg}
```

Add the following to your shell profile (e.g., `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`):

```bash
export GOPATH=$HOME/go
export PATH=$PATH:$GOPATH/bin
```

## Your First Go Program

Let's write a simple "Hello, World!" program to get started:

1. Create a new file called `hello.go`:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, World! Welcome to Go Programming!")
}
```

2. Run your program:

```bash
go run hello.go
```

Output:
```
Hello, World! Welcome to Go Programming!
```

Let's understand this simple program:

- `package main`: Every Go program starts with a package declaration. The `main` package is special - it defines a standalone executable program.
- `import "fmt"`: Imports the format package for input/output functions.
- `func main()`: The entry point of the program. Execution begins here.
- `fmt.Println()`: Prints the text to standard output with a newline.

## Basic Go Syntax

Here are some fundamental aspects of Go syntax:

### Variables and Data Types

Go is statically typed, but offers type inference:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    // Explicit declaration
    var name string = "Gopher"
    
    // Short declaration (type inference)
    age := 5
    
    // Constants
    const language = "Go"
    
    // Multiple declarations
    var (
        isAwesome bool   = true
        version   float64 = 1.18
    )
    
    fmt.Printf("Name: %s, Age: %d\n", name, age)
    fmt.Printf("Language: %s, Version: %.2f\n", language, version)
    fmt.Printf("Is Go awesome? %t\n", isAwesome)
}
```

Output:
```
Name: Gopher, Age: 5
Language: Go, Version: 1.18
Is Go awesome? true
```

### Basic Data Types

Go has several built-in types:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    // Numeric types
    var integer int = 42
    var floatingPoint float64 = 3.14159
    
    // String type
    var text string = "Go is fun"
    
    // Boolean type
    var isTrue bool = true
    
    // Byte (alias for uint8)
    var b byte = 'A'
    
    // Complex numbers
    var complex complex128 = 1 + 2i
    
    fmt.Printf("Integer: %d\n", integer)
    fmt.Printf("Float: %f\n", floatingPoint)
    fmt.Printf("String: %s\n", text)
    fmt.Printf("Boolean: %t\n", isTrue)
    fmt.Printf("Byte: %c (ASCII: %d)\n", b, b)
    fmt.Printf("Complex: %v\n", complex)
}
```

Output:
```
Integer: 42
Float: 3.141590
String: Go is fun
Boolean: true
Byte: A (ASCII: 65)
Complex: (1+2i)
```

### Functions

Functions are first-class citizens in Go:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

// Simple function with parameters and return value
func add(a, b int) int {
    return a + b
}

// Multiple return values
func divide(dividend, divisor float64) (float64, error) {
    if divisor == 0 {
        return 0, fmt.Errorf("cannot divide by zero")
    }
    return dividend / divisor, nil
}

func main() {
    sum := add(5, 7)
    fmt.Println("5 + 7 =", sum)
    
    result, err := divide(10, 2)
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println("Error:", err)
    } else {
        fmt.Printf("10 / 2 = %.2f\n", result)
    }
    
    // Error handling example
    result, err = divide(10, 0)
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println("Error:", err)
    } else {
        fmt.Printf("10 / 0 = %.2f\n", result)
    }
}
```

Output:
```
5 + 7 = 12
10 / 2 = 5.00
Error: cannot divide by zero
```

### Control Structures

Go offers familiar control structures:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    // If-else statement
    age := 20
    if age >= 18 {
        fmt.Println("You can vote!")
    } else {
        fmt.Println("Too young to vote.")
    }
    
    // For loop (standard)
    fmt.Println("Counting from 1 to 5:")
    for i := 1; i <= 5; i++ {
        fmt.Println(i)
    }
    
    // For loop as "while"
    fmt.Println("Counting down from 3:")
    countdown := 3
    for countdown > 0 {
        fmt.Println(countdown)
        countdown--
    }
    
    // Switch statement
    dayOfWeek := "Monday"
    switch dayOfWeek {
    case "Monday":
        fmt.Println("Start of work week")
    case "Friday":
        fmt.Println("End of work week")
    case "Saturday", "Sunday":
        fmt.Println("Weekend!")
    default:
        fmt.Println("Mid-week")
    }
}
```

Output:
```
You can vote!
Counting from 1 to 5:
1
2
3
4
5
Counting down from 3:
3
2
1
Start of work week
```

## Basic Web Server in Go

Let's create a simple web server to showcase Go's capabilities for web development (this will help you understand the foundations of Gin):

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "log"
    "net/http"
)

// Handler function for the home page
func homePage(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    fmt.Fprintf(w, "Welcome to the Go Web Server!")
    fmt.Println("Endpoint Hit: /")
}

// Handler function for the about page
func aboutPage(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    fmt.Fprintf(w, "About this server: Created with Go!")
    fmt.Println("Endpoint Hit: /about")
}

func main() {
    // Define routes
    http.HandleFunc("/", homePage)
    http.HandleFunc("/about", aboutPage)
    
    // Start the server
    fmt.Println("Starting server on port 8080...")
    if err := http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil); err != nil {
        log.Fatal("Server error:", err)
    }
}
```

When you run this program and visit `http://localhost:8080/` in your browser, you'll see "Welcome to the Go Web Server!" displayed. If you visit `http://localhost:8080/about`, you'll see "About this server: Created with Go!".

In your terminal, you'll see logs whenever someone accesses these endpoints.

## Key Features for Web Development

Before diving deeper into Gin, it's important to understand these Go concepts:

### 1. Structs and Methods

Structs are composite data types that group fields of different types:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

// Define a User struct
type User struct {
    ID        int
    FirstName string
    LastName  string
    Email     string
}

// Method for the User struct
func (u User) FullName() string {
    return u.FirstName + " " + u.LastName
}

// Pointer receiver method to modify the User
func (u *User) UpdateEmail(newEmail string) {
    u.Email = newEmail
}

func main() {
    // Create a new user
    user := User{
        ID:        1,
        FirstName: "John",
        LastName:  "Doe",
        Email:     "john@example.com",
    }
    
    // Call the FullName method
    fmt.Println("Full Name:", user.FullName())
    
    // Update the email
    user.UpdateEmail("johndoe@newdomain.com")
    fmt.Println("Updated Email:", user.Email)
}
```

Output:
```
Full Name: John Doe
Updated Email: johndoe@newdomain.com
```

### 2. Packages and Imports

Go code is organized into packages. Let's create a simple project structure:

```
myproject/
├── main.go
└── user/
    └── user.go
```

**user/user.go**:
```go
// Package user provides user-related functionality
package user

// User represents a user in the system
type User struct {
    ID    int
    Name  string
    Email string
}

// New creates a new User
func New(id int, name, email string) User {
    return User{
        ID:    id,
        Name:  name,
        Email: email,
    }
}

// Validate returns true if the user has valid data
func (u User) Validate() bool {
    return u.Name != "" && u.Email != ""
}
```

**main.go**:
```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "myproject/user"
)

func main() {
    // Create a new user using the user package
    u := user.New(1, "Alice Smith", "alice@example.com")
    
    fmt.Printf("User: %s (ID: %d)\n", u.Name, u.ID)
    fmt.Printf("Valid user? %t\n", u.Validate())
    
    // Create an invalid user
    invalidUser := user.User{ID: 2}
    fmt.Printf("Invalid user? %t\n", !invalidUser.Validate())
}
```

Output:
```
User: Alice Smith (ID: 1)
Valid user? true
Invalid user? true
```

## Preparing for Gin

Now that you understand the basics of Go, you're ready to start exploring the Gin web framework. Here's a quick preview of what you'll soon be able to create with Gin:

```go
package main

import "github.com/gin-gonic/gin"

func main() {
    // Initialize Gin router
    r := gin.Default()
    
    // Define a route and handler
    r.GET("/ping", func(c *gin.Context) {
        c.JSON(200, gin.H{
            "message": "pong",
        })
    })
    
    // Start the server
    r.Run(":8080")
}
```

This simple Gin application creates a RESTful API endpoint that returns JSON data. The mechanics of this will be covered in detail in upcoming lessons.
