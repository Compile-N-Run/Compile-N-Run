# Go Variables

Variables are fundamental building blocks in any programming language. In Go, understanding how variables work is essential before diving into Gin web framework development.

## What are Variables in Go?

Variables in Go are named storage locations that hold values of specific types. Go is statically typed, which means variables must have a defined type at compile time.

## Variable Declaration in Go

There are several ways to declare variables in Go:

### 1. Using the `var` keyword

The most basic way to declare a variable is using the `var` keyword:

```go
var name string
name = "Gopher"

// Or in a single line
var age int = 25
```

When you run this code, `name` holds "Gopher" and `age` holds 25.

### 2. Short declaration with `:=`

For local variables, Go offers a shorthand syntax:

```go
username := "gopher123"
score := 95.5
```

This concise syntax declares and initializes variables in one step. The type is inferred from the value.

### 3. Multiple variable declarations

You can declare multiple variables at once:

```go
var (
    firstName string = "Jane"
    lastName  string = "Doe"
    isActive  bool   = true
    level     int    = 3
)

// Or with short declaration
city, country, population := "Tokyo", "Japan", 37400000
```

## Zero Values

Go initializes variables with default "zero values" when no explicit initial value is provided:

```go
var (
    intVar    int     // 0
    floatVar  float64 // 0.0
    boolVar   bool    // false
    stringVar string  // "" (empty string)
    pointerVar *int   // nil
)
```

## Type Conversion

Go requires explicit type conversion when working with different types:

```go
var i int = 42
var f float64 = float64(i)
var u uint = uint(f)

fmt.Printf("i = %d, f = %f, u = %d\n", i, f, u)
// Output: i = 42, f = 42.000000, u = 42
```

## Constants

Constants are like variables but their values cannot be changed after declaration:

```go
const (
    ApiVersion = "v1"
    MaxConnections = 100
    DatabaseName = "app_db"
)
```

## Practical Examples for Gin Applications

Let's see how variables are used in a typical Gin application context:

### 1. Configuration Variables

```go
var (
    port = 8080
    mode = "development"
    dbConnection = "postgres://user:password@localhost:5432/mydb"
)

func main() {
    // Use these variables to configure Gin
    gin.SetMode(mode)
    r := gin.Default()
    // ... routes configuration
    r.Run(fmt.Sprintf(":%d", port))
}
```

### 2. Request Handling with Variables

```go
func getUserProfile(c *gin.Context) {
    // Get variables from request parameters
    userID := c.Param("id")
    
    // Create response variables
    var user User
    var err error
    
    user, err = database.FindUserByID(userID)
    if err != nil {
        c.JSON(http.StatusNotFound, gin.H{"error": "User not found"})
        return
    }
    
    c.JSON(http.StatusOK, user)
}
```

### 3. Environment-Based Configuration

```go
func getEnvironmentConfig() (dbURL string, port int) {
    env := os.Getenv("GO_ENV")
    
    if env == "production" {
        dbURL = os.Getenv("PROD_DB_URL")
        port = 80
    } else {
        dbURL = "postgres://localhost:5432/dev_db"
        port = 8080
    }
    
    return dbURL, port
}
```

## Variable Scope

Variables in Go have different scopes depending on where they're declared:

1. **Package-level variables** are accessible throughout the package
2. **Local variables** are only accessible within their function or block

```go
// Package-level variable
var globalConfig = map[string]string{
    "version": "1.0",
}

func handleRequest(c *gin.Context) {
    // Local variable
    requestID := generateID()
    // Can access both requestID and globalConfig here
}

func otherFunction() {
    // Can access globalConfig but not requestID
}
```

## Best Practices for Variables in Go

1. **Use short variable declarations (`:=`) inside functions** for cleaner code

2. **Use meaningful variable names** that describe the purpose
   ```go
   // Good
   userCount := getUserCount()
   
   // Avoid
   uc := getUserCount()
   ```

3. **Keep variable scope as narrow as possible** to avoid confusion

4. **Group related variables** using the `var ()` or multiple declaration syntax

5. **Use constants for values that don't change**

## Summary

Variables in Go provide named storage for data with specific types. Go offers several ways to declare and initialize variables, with strong typing that helps prevent bugs. As you build Gin applications, you'll use variables for configurations, handling requests, processing data, and more.

Understanding variables thoroughly is essential as you move forward with Go and the Gin framework. The static typing and clear variable rules in Go contribute to writing robust, maintainable web applications.

## Exercises

1. Create a program that declares variables of different types and prints them.
2. Write a function that takes a Gin context and extracts query parameters into appropriately typed variables.
3. Create a configuration structure using variables that could be used in a Gin application.
