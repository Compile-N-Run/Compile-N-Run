# Gin Static Files

When building web applications, you often need to serve static assets like CSS files, JavaScript files, images, and other resources. Gin provides an easy way to serve these files with its built-in functionality. In this tutorial, we'll explore how to serve static files in your Gin applications.

## Understanding Static Files

Static files are files that don't change and are sent to the client exactly as they're stored on the server. Common examples include:

- CSS stylesheets
- JavaScript files
- Images (PNG, JPG, SVG, etc.)
- Fonts
- PDF documents
- Other downloadable resources

## Basic Static File Serving

Gin makes it easy to serve static files using the `Static` method from the router. Here's a simple example:

```go
package main

import "github.com/gin-gonic/gin"

func main() {
    router := gin.Default()
    
    // Serve static files from the "assets" directory
    router.Static("/assets", "./assets")
    
    router.GET("/", func(c *gin.Context) {
        c.String(200, "Welcome to my website!")
    })
    
    router.Run(":8080")
}
```

In this example:

- `router.Static("/assets", "./assets")` maps the URL path `/assets` to the local directory `./assets`
- If a user requests `http://localhost:8080/assets/style.css`, Gin will serve the file from `./assets/style.css`

## Directory Structure

A common setup for a Gin application with static files might look like this:

```
my-gin-app/
  ├── main.go
  ├── templates/
  │   └── index.html
  └── assets/
      ├── css/
      │   └── style.css
      ├── js/
      │   └── app.js
      └── images/
          └── logo.png
```

## Serving Different Types of Static Content

### Serving Single Files with StaticFile

If you need to serve just one specific file, you can use `StaticFile`:

```go
// Map a specific URL to a specific file
router.StaticFile("/favicon.ico", "./assets/favicon.ico")
```

Now, when a browser requests `/favicon.ico`, Gin will serve the file from `./assets/favicon.ico`.

### Serving an Entire Directory with StaticFS

For more advanced use cases, you can use `StaticFS` which allows you to use a custom `http.FileSystem`:

```go
import (
    "github.com/gin-gonic/gin"
    "net/http"
)

func main() {
    router := gin.Default()
    
    // Serve files from the "assets" directory using http.Dir
    router.StaticFS("/more-assets", http.Dir("./assets"))
    
    router.Run(":8080")
}
```

This is particularly useful when you need more control over how files are accessed or when integrating with other file systems.

## Real-World Example: Creating a Simple Website

Let's create a more complete example of a website that uses static files:

```go
package main

import (
    "github.com/gin-gonic/gin"
    "net/http"
)

func main() {
    router := gin.Default()
    
    // Serve static files
    router.Static("/static", "./static")
    router.StaticFile("/favicon.ico", "./static/favicon.ico")
    
    // Load HTML templates
    router.LoadHTMLGlob("templates/*")
    
    // Home page route
    router.GET("/", func(c *gin.Context) {
        c.HTML(http.StatusOK, "index.html", gin.H{
            "title": "My Awesome Gin Website",
        })
    })
    
    router.Run(":8080")
}
```

With a corresponding HTML template (`templates/index.html`):

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>{{ .title }}</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="/static/css/style.css">
    <script src="/static/js/app.js" defer></script>
</head>
<body>
    <header>
        <img src="/static/images/logo.png" alt="Logo">
        <h1>Welcome to My Gin Website</h1>
    </header>
    
    <main>
        <p>This is a simple website using Gin's static file serving capabilities.</p>
    </main>
    
    <footer>
        <p>&copy; 2023 My Gin App</p>
    </footer>
</body>
</html>
```

## Best Practices for Serving Static Files

1. **Cache Control**: For production, consider adding cache headers to optimize performance:

```go
router.Static("/static", "./static")

// Or with custom options
router.StaticFS("/static", http.Dir("./static"))
```

2. **Security Considerations**: Be careful about which directories you expose. Never serve sensitive files or directories.

3. **File Organization**: Keep your static files well organized in subdirectories (css/, js/, images/) for better maintainability.

4. **Performance**: For large applications, consider using a dedicated static file server like Nginx or a CDN for production.

5. **Fingerprinting**: In production, implement file fingerprinting/versioning to help with cache busting when files change.

## Handling File Not Found

When a static file is not found, Gin will return a 404 Not Found response. You can customize this behavior by implementing your own file server handler.

```go
// Custom file server with custom 404 handler
func customStaticFiles(urlPrefix, dir string) gin.HandlerFunc {
    fs := http.Dir(dir)
    fileServer := http.StripPrefix(urlPrefix, http.FileServer(fs))
    
    return func(c *gin.Context) {
        file := c.Param("filepath")
        // Check if file exists and/or if we have permission to access it
        f, err := fs.Open(file)
        if err != nil {
            c.String(http.StatusNotFound, "File not found: %v", file)
            return
        }
        f.Close()
        
        fileServer.ServeHTTP(c.Writer, c.Request)
    }
}

// Usage
router.GET("/custom-static/*filepath", customStaticFiles("/custom-static", "./assets"))
```

## Summary

Serving static files with Gin is straightforward and flexible:

- Use `router.Static()` for serving entire directories of static files
- Use `router.StaticFile()` for mapping specific URLs to specific files
- Use `router.StaticFS()` for more advanced use cases requiring custom file systems

These methods allow you to easily incorporate CSS, JavaScript, images, and other static resources into your Gin-powered web applications.

## Exercises

1. Create a simple Gin application that serves an HTML page with CSS styling and JavaScript functionality.
2. Implement a file browser that lists files in a directory and allows users to download them.
3. Add proper cache control headers to your static file routes to improve performance.
4. Create a custom 404 page for when static files are not found.
