# Flask Redirects

## Introduction

In web applications, redirecting users from one URL to another is a common requirement. Whether after a form submission, an authentication process, or when content has moved, redirects help maintain a smooth user experience. Flask provides simple yet powerful tools to handle redirects efficiently.

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to implement redirects in Flask applications, understand the different types of redirects, and see practical examples of when and how to use them effectively.

## Understanding Flask Redirects

A redirect is an HTTP response with a status code (usually 301 or 302) that instructs the browser to navigate to a different URL than the one originally requested. Rather than returning HTML content, the server sends a response header telling the browser where to go next.

In Flask, redirects are primarily handled through the `redirect()` function from the `flask` module.

## Basic Redirect Syntax

To use redirects in Flask, you first need to import the `redirect` function:

```python
from flask import Flask, redirect
```

The basic syntax for a redirect is:

```python
@app.route('/old-page')
def old_page():
    return redirect('/new-page')
```

Let's create a simple Flask application with redirects:

```python
from flask import Flask, redirect, url_for

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def home():
    return 'Welcome to the Home Page'

@app.route('/redirect-me')
def redirect_to_home():
    return redirect('/')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

In this example, when a user visits `/redirect-me`, they'll be automatically redirected to the home page (`/`).

## Using `url_for()` with Redirects

While you can redirect to hardcoded URL paths, it's generally better practice to use Flask's `url_for()` function. This function generates URLs based on the function name of the view, making your redirects more maintainable:

```python
from flask import Flask, redirect, url_for

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def home():
    return 'Welcome to the Home Page'

@app.route('/redirect-me')
def redirect_to_home():
    # Using url_for instead of hardcoded path
    return redirect(url_for('home'))

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

This approach is more flexible because if you change your route paths later, you won't need to update all your redirect statements.

## Redirect Types and Status Codes

HTTP defines several types of redirects, each with its own status code:

- **301 (Moved Permanently)**: The resource has permanently moved to a new URL
- **302 (Found)**: The resource is temporarily available at a different URL
- **303 (See Other)**: The response to the request can be found at another URI
- **307 (Temporary Redirect)**: Similar to 302, but strictly preserves the HTTP method used
- **308 (Permanent Redirect)**: Similar to 301, but strictly preserves the HTTP method used

By default, Flask's `redirect()` function uses a 302 redirect. You can specify a different status code like this:

```python
@app.route('/permanent-redirect')
def permanent_redirect():
    # 301 is a permanent redirect
    return redirect(url_for('home'), code=301)
```

## Practical Examples

### 1. Post-Login Redirect

A common use case for redirects is after a user logs in:

```python
from flask import Flask, redirect, url_for, request, session

app = Flask(__name__)
app.secret_key = 'your_secret_key'  # Needed for sessions

@app.route('/')
def home():
    if 'username' in session:
        return f'Logged in as {session["username"]}'
    return 'You are not logged in'

@app.route('/login', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def login():
    if request.method == 'POST':
        # Simple authentication (for demonstration only)
        if request.form['username'] == 'admin' and request.form['password'] == 'password':
            session['username'] = request.form['username']
            return redirect(url_for('home'))
        return 'Invalid credentials'
    
    return '''
        <form method="post">
            <p>Username: <input type="text" name="username"></p>
            <p>Password: <input type="password" name="password"></p>
            <p><input type="submit" value="Login"></p>
        </form>
    '''

@app.route('/logout')
def logout():
    session.pop('username', None)
    return redirect(url_for('home'))

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

### 2. Redirecting with Query Parameters

You can pass query parameters with your redirects:

```python
from flask import Flask, redirect, url_for, request

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def home():
    name = request.args.get('name', 'Guest')
    return f'Hello, {name}!'

@app.route('/welcome/<username>')
def welcome(username):
    # Redirect to home with the username as a query parameter
    return redirect(url_for('home', name=username))

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

When you visit `/welcome/John`, you'll be redirected to `/?name=John`, which will display "Hello, John!".

### 3. Conditional Redirects

Sometimes you need to redirect users based on certain conditions:

```python
from flask import Flask, redirect, url_for, request

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def home():
    return 'Welcome to the Home Page'

@app.route('/dashboard')
def dashboard():
    # Check if user is authenticated (simplified example)
    is_authenticated = False  # In a real app, this would check the session
    
    if is_authenticated:
        return 'Welcome to your Dashboard'
    else:
        # Redirect unauthenticated users to login
        return redirect(url_for('login'))

@app.route('/login')
def login():
    return 'Please log in to continue'

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

### 4. Redirecting After Form Submission

It's good practice to redirect after a form submission to prevent duplicate submissions if the user refreshes the page:

```python
from flask import Flask, redirect, url_for, request, render_template

app = Flask(__name__)
messages = []  # A simple in-memory storage (use a database in real applications)

@app.route('/')
def home():
    return render_template('message_board.html', messages=messages)

@app.route('/post-message', methods=['POST'])
def post_message():
    message = request.form.get('message')
    if message:
        messages.append(message)
    
    # Redirect back to home to see all messages
    # This prevents duplicate form submissions on refresh
    return redirect(url_for('home'))

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

The corresponding HTML template (`message_board.html`) might look like this:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Message Board</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Message Board</h1>
    
    <form action="/post-message" method="post">
        <textarea name="message" rows="4" cols="50"></textarea>
        <br>
        <input type="submit" value="Post Message">
    </form>
    
    <h2>Messages:</h2>
    <ul>
        {% for message in messages %}
        <li>{{ message }}</li>
        {% endfor %}
    </ul>
</body>
</html>
```

## Common Redirect Patterns

### Post/Redirect/Get (PRG) Pattern

The PRG pattern is a web development design pattern that prevents duplicate form submissions:

1. User submits a POST request (e.g., fills out a form)
2. Server processes the form data and redirects the user to a different page using GET
3. User's browser follows the redirect to the new page

This pattern prevents the "form resubmission" warning when users refresh the page after submitting a form.

```python
@app.route('/submit', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def submit():
    if request.method == 'POST':
        # Process the form data
        name = request.form.get('name')
        save_to_database(name)  # Fictional function
        
        # Redirect to a success page (GET request)
        return redirect(url_for('success'))
    
    # Show the form for GET requests
    return '''
        <form method="post">
            <input type="text" name="name">
            <input type="submit" value="Submit">
        </form>
    '''

@app.route('/success')
def success():
    return 'Form submitted successfully!'
```

### Redirecting with Flash Messages

Flask's `flash()` function combined with redirects provides a powerful way to give feedback to users:

```python
from flask import Flask, redirect, url_for, flash, render_template, request

app = Flask(__name__)
app.secret_key = 'your_secret_key'  # Required for flash messages

@app.route('/')
def home():
    return render_template('home.html')

@app.route('/process', methods=['POST'])
def process():
    # Process some data
    success = process_data(request.form)  # Fictional function
    
    if success:
        flash('Your request was processed successfully!', 'success')
    else:
        flash('There was an error processing your request.', 'error')
    
    return redirect(url_for('home'))

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

The corresponding template might include:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Home</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome</h1>
    
    {% with messages = get_flashed_messages(with_categories=true) %}
        {% if messages %}
            <ul class="flashes">
                {% for category, message in messages %}
                <li class="{{ category }}">{{ message }}</li>
                {% endfor %}
            </ul>
        {% endif %}
    {% endwith %}
    
    <form action="/process" method="post">
        <!-- Form fields here -->
        <input type="submit" value="Submit">
    </form>
</body>
</html>
```

## Summary

Redirects are an essential part of web application development, allowing you to guide users through your application logically. In Flask, the `redirect()` function makes implementing redirects straightforward, especially when combined with `url_for()`.

Key points to remember:
- Use `redirect(url_for('function_name'))` for maintainable code
- Specify status codes when necessary (e.g., `redirect(url, code=301)`)
- Implement the PRG pattern to prevent duplicate form submissions
- Combine redirects with flash messages to provide feedback to users

By mastering redirects in Flask, you can create more intuitive and user-friendly applications with smoother navigation flows.

## Exercises

1. Create a Flask application with a form that collects a user's name and redirects to a personalized greeting page.

2. Implement a simple login system with redirects that:
   - Redirects authenticated users to a dashboard
   - Redirects unauthenticated users to a login page
   - Redirects successful logins back to the original page they were trying to access

3. Build a small URL shortener application that redirects short URLs to their full versions. For example, make `/s/1` redirect to a longer URL stored in a dictionary.

4. Create a multi-step form that uses redirects between each step and stores the form data in the session.
