# Swift While Loop

Loops are a fundamental part of programming, allowing you to execute code repeatedly based on certain conditions. In this lesson, we'll explore the `while` loop in Swift, one of the primary looping constructs available to control the flow of your programs.

## What is a While Loop?

A `while` loop executes a block of code repeatedly as long as a specified condition remains true. Think of it as saying "keep doing this while something is true."

The basic syntax of a while loop in Swift is:

```swift
while condition {
    // Code to execute as long as condition is true
}
```

The loop first evaluates the `condition`. If it's `true`, the code inside the curly braces executes. After execution, it goes back to the condition and checks again. This process repeats until the condition evaluates to `false`.

## Simple While Loop Example

Let's start with a basic example:

```swift
var counter = 1

while counter <= 5 {
    print("Count is: \(counter)")
    counter += 1
}
```

**Output:**
```
Count is: 1
Count is: 2
Count is: 3
Count is: 4
Count is: 5
```

### How this works:

1. We initialize a variable `counter` with the value `1`
2. The while loop checks if `counter <= 5` (which is true initially)
3. It executes the code block, printing the current value
4. It increments the counter by 1
5. It checks the condition again and repeats steps 3-4 until the condition becomes false

## Important: Avoiding Infinite Loops

One common mistake when using while loops is creating an infinite loop, where the condition never becomes false. For example:

```swift
var counter = 1

while counter > 0 {
    print("This will run forever!")
    // Counter never changes, so condition is always true
}
```

To avoid infinite loops, always make sure:
- Your condition will eventually become false
- You update the variables that affect the condition within the loop

## Practical Example: Input Validation

Let's see how a while loop can be used for input validation:

```swift
import Foundation

var userInput = ""
var validInput = false

while !validInput {
    print("Please enter a number between 1 and 10:")
    userInput = readLine() ?? ""
    
    if let number = Int(userInput), number >= 1 && number <= 10 {
        print("Thank you! You entered a valid number: \(number)")
        validInput = true
    } else {
        print("Invalid input. Try again.")
    }
}
```

In this example, the loop continues to prompt the user until they enter a valid number between 1 and 10.

## While Loops with Collections

While loops can also be used to iterate through collections like arrays:

```swift
let fruits = ["Apple", "Banana", "Cherry", "Date", "Elderberry"]
var index = 0

while index < fruits.count {
    print("Fruit at index \(index): \(fruits[index])")
    index += 1
}
```

**Output:**
```
Fruit at index 0: Apple
Fruit at index 1: Banana
Fruit at index 2: Cherry
Fruit at index 3: Date
Fruit at index 4: Elderberry
```

### Note: 
For simple array iteration, a `for-in` loop is usually more appropriate, but there are situations where while loops offer more flexibility.

## Repeat-While Loop

Swift also provides a variant called the `repeat-while` loop (known as a `do-while` loop in many other languages). The key difference is that a repeat-while loop always executes the code block at least once before checking the condition.

```swift
var counter = 1

repeat {
    print("Counter is: \(counter)")
    counter += 1
} while counter <= 5
```

**Output:**
```
Counter is: 1
Counter is: 2
Counter is: 3
Counter is: 4
Counter is: 5
```

Even if the condition is initially false, the code will execute once:

```swift
var number = 10

repeat {
    print("This will execute once even though the condition is false")
    number += 1
} while number < 10
```

**Output:**
```
This will execute once even though the condition is false
```

## Real-World Example: Game Development

In games, while loops are often used for game loops that continue until certain conditions are met:

```swift
var playerHealth = 100
var gameOver = false

while !gameOver {
    // Simulate player taking damage
    playerHealth -= Int.random(in: 10...20)
    
    print("Player took damage! Health: \(playerHealth)")
    
    // Check if game should end
    if playerHealth <= 0 {
        gameOver = true
        print("Game Over!")
    }
    
    // In a real game, this would process input, update game state, render, etc.
}
```

**Sample Output:**
```
Player took damage! Health: 81
Player took damage! Health: 67
Player took damage! Health: 49
Player took damage! Health: 30
Player took damage! Health: 19
Player took damage! Health: -1
Game Over!
```

## When to Use While Loops

Use while loops when:

1. You don't know in advance how many iterations you need
2. You need to continue a process until a specific condition is met
3. You want to implement an event loop that runs until terminated
4. You need to validate user input until it meets certain criteria

## Summary

The `while` loop is a powerful control flow construct in Swift that allows you to:

- Execute code repeatedly while a condition remains true
- Process data until it meets specific criteria
- Create game loops or event-driven processes

Remember to always include a way for your loop condition to eventually become false to avoid infinite loops. The variant `repeat-while` guarantees that the code executes at least once before checking the condition.

## Exercises

1. Write a while loop that prints all even numbers from 2 to 20.
2. Create a guessing game where the program picks a random number between 1 and 100, and the user tries to guess it. Use a while loop to keep prompting the user until they guess correctly.
3. Write a program that uses a while loop to find the smallest power of 2 that is greater than 1000.
4. Implement a simple calculator program that keeps running until the user chooses to exit.
