# Swift Loops

## Introduction

Loops are fundamental programming constructs that allow you to execute a block of code repeatedly. In Swift, loops are essential for tasks like processing collections of data, performing operations a specific number of times, or continuing an action until a certain condition is met.

Swift provides several types of loops, each designed for different scenarios:

- **For-in loops**: Iterate over sequences like arrays, ranges, or characters in a string
- **While loops**: Execute code as long as a condition remains true
- **Repeat-while loops**: Similar to while loops but guarantee at least one execution

In this tutorial, we'll explore each type of loop in detail with practical examples to help you understand when and how to use them effectively.

## For-in Loops

The for-in loop is one of the most commonly used loops in Swift. It allows you to iterate over elements in a sequence, such as arrays, dictionaries, ranges, and strings.

### Basic Syntax

```swift
for item in collection {
    // code to execute for each item
}
```

### Looping Through Ranges

To execute code a specific number of times, you can use ranges:

```swift
// Closed range: includes both 1 and 5
for number in 1...5 {
    print("Number is \(number)")
}
```

**Output:**
```
Number is 1
Number is 2
Number is 3
Number is 4
Number is 5
```

If you don't need the value from the range, you can use an underscore (`_`) instead:

```swift
// Print "Hello!" 3 times
for _ in 1...3 {
    print("Hello!")
}
```

**Output:**
```
Hello!
Hello!
Hello!
```

### Half-Open Range

Swift also provides half-open ranges that exclude the upper bound:

```swift
// Half-open range: includes 1 but not 5
for number in 1..<5 {
    print("Number is \(number)")
}
```

**Output:**
```
Number is 1
Number is 2
Number is 3
Number is 4
```

### Looping Through Collections

Arrays, strings, and other collections can be iterated using for-in loops:

```swift
let fruits = ["Apple", "Banana", "Cherry", "Date"]

for fruit in fruits {
    print("I like \(fruit)")
}
```

**Output:**
```
I like Apple
I like Banana
I like Cherry
I like Date
```

### Looping with Enumerated()

If you need both the index and value while iterating, use the `enumerated()` method:

```swift
let vegetables = ["Carrot", "Broccoli", "Spinach"]

for (index, vegetable) in vegetables.enumerated() {
    print("\(index + 1): \(vegetable)")
}
```

**Output:**
```
1: Carrot
2: Broccoli
3: Spinach
```

### Looping Through Dictionaries

When looping through a dictionary, each item is a tuple containing a key and a value:

```swift
let heights = ["Tim": 180, "Kim": 165, "Jim": 190]

for (name, height) in heights {
    print("\(name) is \(height) cm tall")
}
```

**Output:**
```
Tim is 180 cm tall
Kim is 165 cm tall
Jim is 190 cm tall
```

> **Note**: Dictionary items are not stored in any particular order, so the output order may vary.

## While Loops

A while loop performs a set of statements until a condition becomes false. They're useful when you don't know in advance how many times the loop will need to execute.

### Basic Syntax

```swift
while condition {
    // code to execute while condition is true
}
```

### Simple While Loop Example

```swift
var count = 1

while count <= 5 {
    print("Count is \(count)")
    count += 1
}
```

**Output:**
```
Count is 1
Count is 2
Count is 3
Count is 4
Count is 5
```

### Reading Input Until a Condition

While loops are useful for processing input until a certain condition is met:

```swift
// Simulating user input with an array
let inputs = ["apple", "banana", "quit", "orange"]
var index = 0

while index < inputs.count {
    let input = inputs[index]
    if input == "quit" {
        print("Quitting...")
        break
    }
    print("Processing: \(input)")
    index += 1
}
```

**Output:**
```
Processing: apple
Processing: banana
Quitting...
```

## Repeat-While Loops

The repeat-while loop is similar to a while loop, but it executes the code block at least once before checking the condition.

### Basic Syntax

```swift
repeat {
    // code to execute at least once
} while condition
```

### Simple Repeat-While Loop Example

```swift
var number = 1

repeat {
    print("Number is \(number)")
    number += 1
} while number <= 5
```

**Output:**
```
Number is 1
Number is 2
Number is 3
Number is 4
Number is 5
```

### When the Condition Is Initially False

The key difference between `while` and `repeat-while` becomes apparent when the condition is initially false:

```swift
var count = 10

// This loop won't execute at all
while count < 10 {
    print("While loop: \(count)")
    count += 1
}

// This loop will execute once
repeat {
    print("Repeat-while loop: \(count)")
    count += 1
} while count < 10
```

**Output:**
```
Repeat-while loop: 10
```

## Control Transfer Statements

Swift provides statements that change the flow of execution within loops:

### Break Statement

The `break` statement ends execution of a loop immediately:

```swift
for number in 1...10 {
    if number == 5 {
        print("Breaking at \(number)")
        break
    }
    print("Number: \(number)")
}
```

**Output:**
```
Number: 1
Number: 2
Number: 3
Number: 4
Breaking at 5
```

### Continue Statement

The `continue` statement skips the current iteration and proceeds to the next:

```swift
for number in 1...10 {
    if number % 2 == 1 {  // Skip odd numbers
        continue
    }
    print("Even number: \(number)")
}
```

**Output:**
```
Even number: 2
Even number: 4
Even number: 6
Even number: 8
Even number: 10
```

### Labeled Statements

When working with nested loops, you can label your statements to specify which loop a `break` or `continue` should affect:

```swift
outerLoop: for i in 1...3 {
    innerLoop: for j in 1...3 {
        if i == 2 && j == 2 {
            print("Breaking outer loop when i=\(i), j=\(j)")
            break outerLoop
        }
        print("i=\(i), j=\(j)")
    }
}
```

**Output:**
```
i=1, j=1
i=1, j=2
i=1, j=3
i=2, j=1
Breaking outer loop when i=2, j=2
```

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: Calculating Factorial

```swift
func factorial(of number: Int) -> Int {
    var result = 1
    for i in 1...number {
        result *= i
    }
    return result
}

let num = 5
print("Factorial of \(num) is \(factorial(of: num))")
```

**Output:**
```
Factorial of 5 is 120
```

### Example 2: Finding Prime Numbers

```swift
func isPrime(_ number: Int) -> Bool {
    guard number > 1 else { return false }
    
    var i = 2
    while i * i <= number {
        if number % i == 0 {
            return false
        }
        i += 1
    }
    return true
}

print("Prime numbers between 1 and 20:")
for num in 1...20 {
    if isPrime(num) {
        print(num, terminator: " ")
    }
}
```

**Output:**
```
Prime numbers between 1 and 20:
2 3 5 7 11 13 17 19 
```

### Example 3: Processing User Input

This example simulates processing user commands until they decide to quit:

```swift
// Simulating a command processor
func processCommands() {
    // In a real app, this would come from actual user input
    let commands = ["list", "add", "delete", "help", "quit"]
    var index = 0
    
    repeat {
        // Simulate getting the next command
        let command = commands[index]
        index += 1
        
        // Process the command
        switch command {
        case "list":
            print("Listing all items...")
        case "add":
            print("Adding new item...")
        case "delete":
            print("Deleting item...")
        case "help":
            print("Showing help menu...")
        case "quit":
            print("Quitting application...")
            return
        default:
            print("Unknown command")
        }
    } while index < commands.count
}

processCommands()
```

**Output:**
```
Listing all items...
Adding new item...
Deleting item...
Showing help menu...
Quitting application...
```

## Summary

Swift loops are powerful constructs that allow you to execute code repeatedly in different ways:

- **For-in loops** are ideal for iterating through ranges, arrays, dictionaries, and other sequences
- **While loops** execute code while a condition remains true
- **Repeat-while loops** execute code at least once, then continue while a condition remains true
- **Control transfer statements** like `break` and `continue` provide precise control over loop execution

When deciding which loop to use:
- Use `for-in` when you know the number of iterations in advance
- Use `while` when you need to check a condition before executing code
- Use `repeat-while` when you need to execute code at least once
