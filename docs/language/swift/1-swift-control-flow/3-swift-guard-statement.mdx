# Swift Guard Statement

When writing Swift code, handling errors and invalid states gracefully is essential for building robust applications. The `guard` statement is a powerful control flow mechanism that helps you write cleaner, more maintainable code by handling invalid conditions early.

## What is a Guard Statement?

A `guard` statement is a conditional statement that requires a condition to be true in order for the code after it to execute. If the condition evaluates to false, the `else` branch must exit the current scope using `return`, `break`, `continue`, or `throw`.

The main purpose of `guard` is to:

1. Handle failure cases early and exit the current scope
2. Unwrap optional values safely
3. Improve code readability by reducing nesting
4. Make the "happy path" of your code more prominent

## Basic Syntax

The basic syntax of a guard statement is:

```swift
guard condition else {
    // Code that executes when condition is false
    // Must exit the scope (return, break, continue, throw)
}

// Code here only executes if condition is true
```

## Using Guard for Optional Binding

One of the most common uses of `guard` is to safely unwrap optional values:

```swift
func processUsername(_ username: String?) {
    guard let username = username else {
        print("Username is required")
        return
    }
    
    // Here username is a non-optional String
    print("Processing user: \(username)")
}

// Example usage:
processUsername("johndoe")  // Output: Processing user: johndoe
processUsername(nil)        // Output: Username is required
```

In this example, the `guard` statement unwraps the optional `username`. If `username` is `nil`, the code in the `else` block executes and the function returns early. If `username` is not `nil`, it's safely unwrapped and available as a non-optional constant in the rest of the function.

## Guard vs If Statements

Let's compare `guard` and `if` statements to understand when to use each one:

```swift
// Using if statement (leads to nested code)
func processUserData(name: String?, age: Int?) {
    if let name = name {
        if let age = age {
            if age >= 18 {
                print("\(name) is \(age) years old and an adult.")
            } else {
                print("\(name) is a minor.")
            }
        } else {
            print("Age is required.")
        }
    } else {
        print("Name is required.")
    }
}

// Using guard statements (flat code structure)
func processUserDataWithGuard(name: String?, age: Int?) {
    guard let name = name else {
        print("Name is required.")
        return
    }
    
    guard let age = age else {
        print("Age is required.")
        return
    }
    
    if age >= 18 {
        print("\(name) is \(age) years old and an adult.")
    } else {
        print("\(name) is a minor.")
    }
}
```

The function using `guard` statements is more readable because:
- It handles error cases early and exits
- It reduces nesting levels
- The main logic is more prominent
- Unwrapped values are available throughout the function's scope

## Multiple Conditions in Guard Statements

You can include multiple conditions in a single `guard` statement using commas:

```swift
func validateUser(id: String?, age: Int?) {
    guard let id = id, let age = age, age >= 18 else {
        print("Invalid user: ID must be provided and age must be at least 18")
        return
    }
    
    print("Valid user: ID \(id), Age \(age)")
}

validateUser(id: "ABC123", age: 25)  // Output: Valid user: ID ABC123, Age 25
validateUser(id: "DEF456", age: 16)  // Output: Invalid user: ID must be provided and age must be at least 18
validateUser(id: nil, age: 30)       // Output: Invalid user: ID must be provided and age must be at least 18
```

## Using Guard in Loops

The `guard` statement can be used within loops with `continue` to skip iterations:

```swift
let numbers = [10, 15, nil, 20, nil, 30]

for number in numbers {
    guard let number = number else {
        print("Skipping nil value")
        continue
    }
    
    print("Processing number: \(number)")
}

/* Output:
Processing number: 10
Processing number: 15
Skipping nil value
Processing number: 20
Skipping nil value
Processing number: 30
*/
```

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Form Validation

```swift
func validateForm(username: String?, email: String?, password: String?) {
    guard let username = username, !username.isEmpty else {
        print("Error: Username is required")
        return
    }
    
    guard let email = email, email.contains("@") else {
        print("Error: Valid email is required")
        return
    }
    
    guard let password = password, password.count >= 8 else {
        print("Error: Password must be at least 8 characters")
        return
    }
    
    print("Form validated successfully! Username: \(username), Email: \(email)")
    // Proceed with form submission
}

validateForm(username: "john_doe", email: "john@example.com", password: "securepwd123")
// Output: Form validated successfully! Username: john_doe, Email: john@example.com

validateForm(username: "", email: "john@example.com", password: "securepwd123")
// Output: Error: Username is required

validateForm(username: "john_doe", email: "invalid-email", password: "securepwd123")
// Output: Error: Valid email is required
```

### Example 2: API Response Handling

```swift
struct User {
    let id: Int
    let name: String
}

func processAPIResponse(data: Data?, response: URLResponse?, error: Error?) {
    // Check for network errors
    guard error == nil else {
        print("Error: \(error!.localizedDescription)")
        return
    }
    
    // Ensure we have response and data
    guard let httpResponse = response as? HTTPURLResponse,
          let data = data else {
        print("Error: Invalid response or missing data")
        return
    }
    
    // Check for successful status code
    guard (200...299).contains(httpResponse.statusCode) else {
        print("Error: HTTP Status \(httpResponse.statusCode)")
        return
    }
    
    // Try to decode the data
    do {
        let user = try JSONDecoder().decode(User.self, from: data)
        print("User loaded successfully: \(user.name)")
    } catch {
        print("Error: Failed to decode user data")
    }
}
```

## Best Practices for Using Guard

1. **Use guard for preconditions**: Check required conditions at the beginning of functions.
2. **Keep the else blocks short**: Focus on handling the error condition and exiting.
3. **Make sure to exit the scope**: Always use `return`, `throw`, `break`, or `continue` in the else block.
4. **Use guard for optional unwrapping**: Especially when you need the unwrapped value throughout the function.
5. **Combine related conditions**: Group logically connected validations in a single guard statement.

## Summary

The `guard` statement is a powerful tool in Swift for writing more robust, readable code:

- It helps handle failure cases early
- Unwraps optionals safely, making them available in the broader scope
- Reduces nesting and improves code readability
- Makes the happy path of your code more prominent
- Forces explicit handling of error cases

By making your error conditions and early returns explicit, `guard` statements make your code more maintainable and less prone to runtime errors.

## Exercises

1. Write a function that validates a password using `guard` statements to check that it:
   - Has at least 8 characters
   - Contains at least one uppercase letter
   - Contains at least one digit

2. Create a function that processes an array of optional strings, using `guard` within a loop to skip over nil values and empty strings.

3. Refactor the following nested `if` code using `guard` statements:

```swift
func processPayment(amount: Double?, creditCard: String?) {
    if let amount = amount {
        if amount > 0 {
            if let creditCard = creditCard {
                if !creditCard.isEmpty {
                    print("Processing \(amount) with card \(creditCard)")
                } else {
                    print("Credit card is empty")
                }
            } else {
                print("Credit card is required")
            }
        } else {
            print("Amount must be positive")
        }
    } else {
        print("Amount is required")
    }
}
```
