# Swift For Loop

## Introduction

The `for` loop is one of the most common control flow statements in Swift programming. It allows you to execute a block of code repeatedly for a specified number of times or to iterate through elements in a collection such as arrays, dictionaries, ranges, and strings. For loops in Swift are designed to be safe and efficient, helping you avoid common programming errors like off-by-one errors or index out-of-bounds exceptions.

In this tutorial, we'll explore how to use for loops in Swift, starting with the basics and moving on to more advanced use cases.

## Basic For Loop Syntax

The most common form of a for loop in Swift uses the `for-in` syntax to iterate over a sequence:

```swift
for item in sequence {
    // Code to be executed for each item
}
```

Where:
- `item` is a constant that represents the current element in each iteration
- `sequence` is a collection or range to iterate through

## Iterating Through Ranges

### Closed Range Operator

Swift provides a convenient way to iterate through a range of numbers using the closed range operator (`...`):

```swift
// Print numbers from 1 to 5
for number in 1...5 {
    print(number)
}
```

Output:
```
1
2
3
4
5
```

### Half-Open Range Operator

If you want to exclude the upper bound, you can use the half-open range operator (`..<`):

```swift
// Print numbers from 1 to 4
for number in 1..<5 {
    print(number)
}
```

Output:
```
1
2
3
4
```

### One-Sided Range

Swift also supports one-sided ranges for when you want to iterate from a value to the end of a collection:

```swift
let names = ["Anna", "Brian", "Craig", "Donna", "Eric"]

// Iterate from index 2 to the end
for name in names[2...] {
    print(name)
}
```

Output:
```
Craig
Donna
Eric
```

Or from the beginning up to a certain index:

```swift
// Iterate from the beginning to index 2
for name in names[..<3] {
    print(name)
}
```

Output:
```
Anna
Brian
Craig
```

## Iterating Through Collections

### Arrays

```swift
let fruits = ["Apple", "Banana", "Orange", "Mango", "Strawberry"]

for fruit in fruits {
    print("I like \(fruit)s")
}
```

Output:
```
I like Apples
I like Bananas
I like Oranges
I like Mangos
I like Strawberrys
```

### Dictionaries

When you iterate through a dictionary, each item is returned as a key-value tuple:

```swift
let studentScores = ["John": 85, "Emma": 92, "Michael": 78, "Sophia": 95]

for (name, score) in studentScores {
    print("\(name) scored \(score) points")
}
```

Output:
```
John scored 85 points
Emma scored 92 points
Michael scored 78 points
Sophia scored 95 points
```

### Strings

You can iterate through the characters in a string:

```swift
let greeting = "Hello"

for character in greeting {
    print(character)
}
```

Output:
```
H
e
l
l
o
```

## Using Enumerated()

Sometimes you need to know the index of each element while iterating. The `enumerated()` method provides both the index and the value:

```swift
let planets = ["Mercury", "Venus", "Earth", "Mars", "Jupiter"]

for (index, planet) in planets.enumerated() {
    print("Planet \(index + 1): \(planet)")
}
```

Output:
```
Planet 1: Mercury
Planet 2: Venus
Planet 3: Earth
Planet 4: Mars
Planet 5: Jupiter
```

## Conditional Iterations

### Using where Clause

You can add a `where` clause to filter iterations:

```swift
// Print only even numbers
for number in 1...10 where number % 2 == 0 {
    print(number)
}
```

Output:
```
2
4
6
8
10
```

## Stride Function

If you want to iterate with a specific step size, you can use the `stride(from:to:by:)` function:

```swift
// Count from 0 to 10 by 2
for i in stride(from: 0, to: 11, by: 2) {
    print(i)
}
```

Output:
```
0
2
4
6
8
10
```

Note that `stride(from:to:by:)` doesn't include the upper bound. If you want to include the upper bound, use `stride(from:through:by:)`:

```swift
// Count down from 10 to 1 with a step of -2
for i in stride(from: 10, through: 1, by: -2) {
    print(i)
}
```

Output:
```
10
8
6
4
2
```

## Ignoring the Loop Variable

If you don't need the current value in the loop iteration, you can use the underscore (`_`):

```swift
// Print "Hello!" 5 times
for _ in 1...5 {
    print("Hello!")
}
```

Output:
```
Hello!
Hello!
Hello!
Hello!
Hello!
```

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: Calculating Factorial

```swift
func factorial(of number: Int) -> Int {
    var result = 1
    for i in 1...number {
        result *= i
    }
    return result
}

let number = 5
let factorialResult = factorial(of: number)
print("Factorial of \(number) is \(factorialResult)")
```

Output:
```
Factorial of 5 is 120
```

### Example 2: Building a Multiplication Table

```swift
func multiplicationTable(for number: Int, upto range: Int) {
    print("Multiplication table for \(number):")
    for i in 1...range {
        print("\(number) × \(i) = \(number * i)")
    }
}

multiplicationTable(for: 7, upto: 5)
```

Output:
```
Multiplication table for 7:
7 × 1 = 7
7 × 2 = 14
7 × 3 = 21
7 × 4 = 28
7 × 5 = 35
```

### Example 3: Finding Prime Numbers

```swift
func isPrime(_ number: Int) -> Bool {
    guard number > 1 else { return false }
    
    // Check if number is divisible by any integer from 2 to sqrt(number)
    for divisor in 2..<Int(Double(number).squareRoot()) + 1 {
        if number % divisor == 0 {
            return false
        }
    }
    return true
}

print("Prime numbers between 1 and 20:")
for number in 1...20 {
    if isPrime(number) {
        print(number, terminator: " ")
    }
}
```

Output:
```
Prime numbers between 1 and 20:
2 3 5 7 11 13 17 19 
```

## Summary

The for loop in Swift provides a powerful and flexible way to iterate through ranges and collections. Here's what we've covered:

- Basic for-in loop syntax
- Iterating through ranges using closed range (`...`), half-open range (`..<`), and one-sided ranges
- Iterating through collections like arrays, dictionaries, and strings
- Using `enumerated()` to access both index and value
- Filtering iterations with the `where` clause
- Using `stride()` to iterate with specific steps
