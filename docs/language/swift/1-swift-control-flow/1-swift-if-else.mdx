# Swift If Else

Decision-making is a fundamental aspect of programming. In Swift, the `if-else` statement is one of the primary tools for implementing conditional logic, allowing your programs to make decisions based on certain conditions.

## Introduction to Conditional Statements

In programming, we often need our code to behave differently depending on certain conditions. For example, an app might show different screens for logged-in versus anonymous users, or a game might adjust difficulty based on a player's score.

Swift's `if-else` statements let you execute different blocks of code based on conditions that evaluate to either `true` or `false`.

## Basic If Statement Syntax

The simplest form of a conditional statement in Swift is the `if` statement:

```swift
if condition {
    // Code to execute when condition is true
}
```

The condition must evaluate to a Boolean value (`true` or `false`). If the condition is `true`, Swift executes the code inside the braces. If the condition is `false`, Swift skips that code block.

### Example: Simple If Statement

```swift
let temperature = 25

if temperature > 20 {
    print("It's a warm day!")
}
```

**Output:**
```
It's a warm day!
```

In this example, since 25 is greater than 20, the condition evaluates to `true`, and the message is printed.

## If-Else Statement

To provide an alternative set of code to execute when the condition is `false`, we use the `else` clause:

```swift
if condition {
    // Code to execute when condition is true
} else {
    // Code to execute when condition is false
}
```

### Example: If-Else Statement

```swift
let temperature = 15

if temperature > 20 {
    print("It's a warm day!")
} else {
    print("It's not that warm today.")
}
```

**Output:**
```
It's not that warm today.
```

Since the temperature is 15, which is not greater than 20, the condition evaluates to `false`, and the code in the `else` block is executed.

## Multiple Conditions with Else If

For situations where you need to check multiple conditions, Swift provides the `else if` clause:

```swift
if condition1 {
    // Code to execute when condition1 is true
} else if condition2 {
    // Code to execute when condition1 is false but condition2 is true
} else {
    // Code to execute when both conditions are false
}
```

Swift evaluates conditions in order, from top to bottom. As soon as a condition evaluates to `true`, its corresponding code block executes, and the rest are skipped.

### Example: Else If Statement

```swift
let temperature = 15

if temperature > 25 {
    print("It's a hot day!")
} else if temperature > 20 {
    print("It's a warm day!")
} else if temperature > 10 {
    print("It's a mild day.")
} else {
    print("It's a cold day.")
}
```

**Output:**
```
It's a mild day.
```

In this example:
- First, Swift checks if temperature > 25, which is false
- Next, it checks if temperature > 20, which is also false
- Then, it checks if temperature > 10, which is true (15 > 10)
- The message "It's a mild day." is printed, and the final `else` is skipped

## Nested If Statements

You can place an `if` statement inside another `if` or `else` block, creating what's called a "nested" if statement:

```swift
if outerCondition {
    // Code when outerCondition is true
    
    if innerCondition {
        // Code when both conditions are true
    } else {
        // Code when outerCondition is true but innerCondition is false
    }
} else {
    // Code when outerCondition is false
}
```

### Example: Nested If Statement

```swift
let temperature = 25
let isRaining = false

if temperature > 20 {
    print("It's warm outside.")
    
    if isRaining {
        print("But remember to take an umbrella!")
    } else {
        print("Enjoy the nice weather!")
    }
} else {
    print("It's not very warm today.")
}
```

**Output:**
```
It's warm outside.
Enjoy the nice weather!
```

## Using Logical Operators in Conditions

Swift provides logical operators to combine conditions:

- `&&` (AND): Both conditions must be true
- `||` (OR): At least one condition must be true
- `!` (NOT): Inverts a Boolean value

### Example: Logical Operators

```swift
let temperature = 25
let isRaining = false

if temperature > 20 && !isRaining {
    print("Perfect day for outdoor activities!")
} else if temperature > 20 || !isRaining {
    print("It's either warm or not raining (or both).")
} else {
    print("It's cold and raining. Better stay inside.")
}
```

**Output:**
```
Perfect day for outdoor activities!
```

## Ternary Conditional Operator

Swift offers a shorthand for simple if-else statements called the ternary conditional operator:

```swift
condition ? valueIfTrue : valueIfFalse
```

### Example: Ternary Operator

```swift
let temperature = 25
let weatherDescription = temperature > 20 ? "warm" : "cold"
print("It's \(weatherDescription) today.")
```

**Output:**
```
It's warm today.
```

This concise syntax is particularly useful for simple conditional assignments.

## Real-World Applications

### User Authentication

```swift
let username = "swift_user"
let password = "password123"
let enteredUsername = "swift_user"
let enteredPassword = "wrong_password"

if username == enteredUsername && password == enteredPassword {
    print("Login successful!")
} else if username == enteredUsername {
    print("Incorrect password. Please try again.")
} else {
    print("User not found. Please register.")
}
```

**Output:**
```
Incorrect password. Please try again.
```

### Form Validation

```swift
let email = "user@example.com"
let hasAtSymbol = email.contains("@")
let hasDotSymbol = email.contains(".")
let isValidLength = email.count >= 5

if hasAtSymbol && hasDotSymbol && isValidLength {
    print("Email format appears valid.")
} else {
    print("Invalid email format.")
    
    if !hasAtSymbol {
        print("Email must contain an @ symbol.")
    }
    
    if !hasDotSymbol {
        print("Email must contain a period.")
    }
    
    if !isValidLength {
        print("Email must be at least 5 characters long.")
    }
}
```

**Output:**
```
Email format appears valid.
```

### Game Logic

```swift
let playerScore = 850
let highScore = 1000

if playerScore >= highScore {
    print("New high score achieved!")
    print("Previous record beaten by \(playerScore - highScore) points.")
} else if playerScore >= highScore * 0.8 {
    print("Almost there! You're within \(highScore - playerScore) points of the high score.")
} else if playerScore >= highScore * 0.5 {
    print("Good effort! You're getting better.")
} else {
    print("Keep practicing to improve your score.")
}
```

**Output:**
```
Almost there! You're within 150 points of the high score.
```

## Best Practices for If-Else Statements

1. **Keep conditions simple**: Complex conditions can be hard to understand. Consider breaking them down or using intermediate variables with descriptive names.

2. **Be mindful of order**: When using `else if` chains, order matters. Put more specific or common cases first for better readability and efficiency.

3. **Avoid nested if statements when possible**: Deeply nested if statements can make code hard to follow. Consider refactoring with early returns or guard statements.

4. **Use consistent brace style**: Swift's standard is to place opening braces on the same line as the condition.

## Summary

In this guide, we've learned how to use Swift's `if-else` statements to make decisions in our code:

- Basic `if` statements execute code conditionally
- `if-else` statements provide an alternative when conditions aren't met
- `else if` allows checking multiple conditions in sequence
- Nested if statements allow for more complex decision trees
- Logical operators (`&&`, `||`, `!`) can combine conditions
- The ternary operator provides a concise alternative for simple cases

The ability to make decisions is what makes programs dynamic and interactive. With `if-else` statements, your Swift code can respond to different situations intelligently.

## Exercises

1. Write a function that determines if a given year is a leap year. (Hint: A year is a leap year if it's divisible by 4, except for century years which must be divisible by 400.)

2. Create a BMI calculator that provides different messages based on the calculated BMI value.

3. Implement a simple grade calculator that converts numerical scores (0-100) to letter grades (A, B, C, D, F).

4. Write a program that determines if a triangle is equilateral, isosceles, or scalene based on the lengths of its sides.
