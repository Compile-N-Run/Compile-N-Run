# Swift Tuple Decomposition

Tuple decomposition (also called destructuring) is one of the most useful features of Swift tuples. It allows you to extract individual values from a tuple into separate constants or variables in a single, concise statement. This technique makes your code more readable and reduces the need for accessing tuple elements by index.

## Understanding Tuple Decomposition

At its core, tuple decomposition is the process of breaking down a tuple into its constituent parts. Instead of accessing individual elements using dot notation (e.g., `myTuple.0`, `myTuple.1`), you can extract all values at once.

### Basic Syntax

```swift
let myTuple = (value1, value2, value3)
let (first, second, third) = myTuple
```

Let's see this in action with a simple example:

```swift
// Creating a tuple
let httpStatus = (404, "Not Found")

// Decomposing the tuple
let (statusCode, statusMessage) = httpStatus

print("Status: \(statusCode)")
print("Message: \(statusMessage)")
```

**Output:**
```
Status: 404
Message: Not Found
```

## Ignoring Certain Values with Underscore

Sometimes you might only need some values from a tuple. Swift lets you ignore specific elements using an underscore (`_`):

```swift
let fullName = ("John", "Smith", "Jr.")

// Only interested in first and last name
let (firstName, _, suffix) = fullName

print("Name: \(firstName) \(suffix)")
```

**Output:**
```
Name: John Jr.
```

This is particularly useful when working with functions that return tuples with multiple values, but you only care about some of them.

## Decomposition in Function Returns

Tuple decomposition works seamlessly with functions that return tuples:

```swift
func getUserInfo() -> (String, Int, Bool) {
    return ("Alex", 28, true)
}

// Decomposing directly from the function return
let (name, age, isPremium) = getUserInfo()

print("\(name) is \(age) years old")
print("Premium user: \(isPremium ? "Yes" : "No")")
```

**Output:**
```
Alex is 28 years old
Premium user: Yes
```

## Decomposing in a Single Line (Initialization + Decomposition)

You can also create and decompose a tuple in a single statement:

```swift
let (x, y) = (10, 20)
print("Coordinates: (\(x), \(y))")
```

**Output:**
```
Coordinates: (10, 20)
```

## Swapping Variables Using Tuple Decomposition

One elegant use of tuple decomposition is swapping variable values without needing a temporary variable:

```swift
var a = 5
var b = 10

print("Before swap: a = \(a), b = \(b)")

// Swap using tuple decomposition
(a, b) = (b, a)

print("After swap: a = \(a), b = \(b)")
```

**Output:**
```
Before swap: a = 5, b = 10
After swap: a = 10, b = 5
```

## Partial Decomposition with Named Tuples

When working with named tuples, you can still use decomposition:

```swift
let employee = (name: "Sarah", id: 1001, department: "Engineering")

// Decompose all values
let (employeeName, employeeId, employeeDept) = employee
print("\(employeeName) works in \(employeeDept)")

// Or access by name
let name = employee.name
print("Employee ID: \(employee.id)")
```

**Output:**
```
Sarah works in Engineering
Employee ID: 1001
```

## Real-World Applications

### Example 1: Processing Geographic Coordinates

```swift
func calculateDistance(from location1: (Double, Double), to location2: (Double, Double)) -> Double {
    let (lat1, long1) = location1
    let (lat2, long2) = location2
    
    // Simplified distance calculation for demonstration
    let latDiff = lat2 - lat1
    let longDiff = long2 - long1
    return sqrt(latDiff * latDiff + longDiff * longDiff)
}

let newYork = (40.7128, -74.0060)
let losAngeles = (34.0522, -118.2437)

let distance = calculateDistance(from: newYork, to: losAngeles)
print("Distance between cities: \(distance)")
```

**Output:**
```
Distance between cities: 44.76019778817354
```

### Example 2: Handling API Responses

```swift
// Simulates an API response with status code and data
func fetchUserData(userId: Int) -> (Int, [String: Any]?) {
    // In a real app, this would make a network request
    if userId > 0 {
        return (200, ["name": "Jane Doe", "email": "jane@example.com"])
    } else {
        return (404, nil)
    }
}

// Using decomposition to handle the response
let userId = 123
let (statusCode, userData) = fetchUserData(userId: userId)

if statusCode == 200, let data = userData {
    print("User found: \(data["name"] ?? "Unknown")")
} else {
    print("Error: User not found (Status code: \(statusCode))")
}
```

**Output:**
```
User found: Jane Doe
```

### Example 3: Handling Multi-value Validations

```swift
func validatePassword(_ password: String) -> (isValid: Bool, message: String) {
    if password.count < 8 {
        return (false, "Password must be at least 8 characters")
    }
    if !password.contains(where: { $0.isNumber }) {
        return (false, "Password must contain at least one number")
    }
    return (true, "Password is valid")
}

let password = "secure123"
let (isValid, message) = validatePassword(password)

if isValid {
    print("✅ \(message)")
} else {
    print("❌ \(message)")
}
```

**Output:**
```
✅ Password is valid
```

## Summary

Tuple decomposition is a powerful Swift feature that allows you to:

- Extract individual values from tuples in a clean, concise way
- Ignore elements you don't need using the underscore (`_`)
- Work more efficiently with function returns that use tuples
- Perform operations like variable swapping elegantly
- Make code more readable by giving meaningful names to tuple components

By mastering tuple decomposition, you'll write more expressive code and handle multi-value data more effectively in Swift.

## Exercises

1. Create a function that returns a tuple with a person's name, age, and city. Then use decomposition to extract and print these values.

2. Write a function that divides two numbers and returns both the quotient and remainder as a tuple. Use decomposition to handle the result.

3. Create an example where you use tuple decomposition to parse a date string into day, month, and year components.

4. Implement the `minMax` function that takes an array of integers and returns the minimum and maximum values as a tuple. Use decomposition to print these values.
