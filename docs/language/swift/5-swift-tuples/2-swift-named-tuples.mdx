# Swift Named Tuples

In the previous section, we explored basic tuples in Swift. Now, let's take our understanding a step further by looking at **named tuples** - a powerful feature that makes your tuples more readable and self-documenting.

## Introduction to Named Tuples

Named tuples allow you to give meaningful names to the elements within a tuple, making your code more expressive and easier to understand. Rather than accessing elements by their position index (like `myTuple.0`, `myTuple.1`), you can access them using descriptive names.

## Basic Syntax of Named Tuples

### Creating Named Tuples

To create a named tuple, you assign names to each element in the tuple declaration:

```swift
let person: (name: String, age: Int, profession: String) = ("Alex", 28, "Developer")
```

Or more simply:

```swift
let person = (name: "Alex", age: 28, profession: "Developer")
```

### Accessing Named Tuple Elements

You can access the elements of a named tuple using their names:

```swift
let person = (name: "Alex", age: 28, profession: "Developer")

print(person.name)       // Output: Alex
print(person.age)        // Output: 28
print(person.profession) // Output: Developer
```

You can still access elements by their index positions too:

```swift
print(person.0) // Output: Alex
print(person.1) // Output: 28
print(person.2) // Output: Developer
```

However, using the named properties makes your code much more readable and less prone to errors.

## Working with Named Tuples

### Declaring Named Tuple Types

You can declare a named tuple type that you can reuse:

```swift
typealias Employee = (name: String, id: Int, role: String)

let employee1: Employee = ("John", 1001, "Engineer")
let employee2: Employee = ("Sarah", 1002, "Designer")

print(employee1.name) // Output: John
print(employee2.role) // Output: Designer
```

### Decomposing Named Tuples

Just like with regular tuples, you can decompose named tuples:

```swift
let product = (name: "MacBook Pro", price: 1999.99, inStock: true)

let (productName, productPrice, availability) = product

print(productName)   // Output: MacBook Pro
print(productPrice)  // Output: 1999.99
print(availability)  // Output: true
```

You can also decompose selectively:

```swift
let (name, _, status) = product
print(name)    // Output: MacBook Pro
print(status)  // Output: true
```

### Modifying Named Tuples

Remember that tuples are value types. If you need to modify a tuple, you'll need to create a new one or use a variable:

```swift
var user = (name: "Bob", age: 25)
user.age = 26
print(user) // Output: (name: "Bob", age: 26)
```

## Practical Applications of Named Tuples

### Function Return Values

Named tuples make great return values for functions because they add clarity:

```swift
func getWeatherData() -> (temperature: Double, condition: String, humidity: Double) {
    // Fetch weather data
    return (23.5, "Sunny", 0.45)
}

let weather = getWeatherData()
print("Today's weather: \(weather.condition), \(weather.temperature)°C with \(weather.humidity * 100)% humidity")
// Output: Today's weather: Sunny, 23.5°C with 45.0% humidity
```

### Processing Data

Named tuples can represent structured data neatly:

```swift
func processUserInput(name: String, age: Int) -> (isValid: Bool, message: String) {
    if name.isEmpty {
        return (false, "Name cannot be empty")
    }
    
    if age < 18 {
        return (false, "Must be at least 18 years old")
    }
    
    return (true, "Input validated successfully")
}

let validation = processUserInput(name: "Alice", age: 17)

if validation.isValid {
    print("Success: \(validation.message)")
} else {
    print("Error: \(validation.message)")
}
// Output: Error: Must be at least 18 years old
```

### Temporary Grouped Data

When you need to temporarily group data without creating a full struct or class:

```swift
func analyzeText(_ text: String) -> (characterCount: Int, wordCount: Int, lineCount: Int) {
    let characters = text.count
    let words = text.split(separator: " ").count
    let lines = text.split(separator: "\n").count
    
    return (characters, words, lines)
}

let article = "Swift is amazing.\nNamed tuples are useful."
let analysis = analyzeText(article)

print("Character count: \(analysis.characterCount)")
print("Word count: \(analysis.wordCount)")
print("Line count: \(analysis.lineCount)")
// Output:
// Character count: 40
// Word count: 7
// Line count: 2
```

## Named Tuples vs. Structs

While named tuples are very useful, they are best for simple groupings of related values. When you need:

- Methods
- Computed properties
- More complex property behaviors
- Conformance to protocols

...you should consider using a `struct` instead.

**Named tuple example:**
```swift
let book = (title: "Swift Programming", author: "John Doe", pages: 300)
```

**Equivalent struct example:**
```swift
struct Book {
    let title: String
    let author: String
    let pages: Int
}

let book = Book(title: "Swift Programming", author: "John Doe", pages: 300)
```

## Summary

Named tuples in Swift provide a simple yet powerful way to group related values with descriptive labels. They improve code readability and make your intentions clearer. Key points to remember:

- Named tuples let you access elements using descriptive names
- You can still access elements by index if needed
- They're perfect for returning multiple values from functions
- Use them for simple data grouping; for more complex needs, consider structs

## Practice Exercises

1. Create a named tuple to represent a geographic coordinate with latitude and longitude.
2. Write a function that returns a named tuple containing information about a movie (title, director, year, and rating).
3. Create a function that takes a string and returns a named tuple with the count of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, and digits.
4. Use a named tuple to track a student's progress in different subjects, then write code to calculate their average score.
