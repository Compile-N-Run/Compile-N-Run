# Swift Tuple Comparison

## Introduction

When working with Swift tuples, you'll often need to compare them to make decisions in your code. Swift provides built-in comparison capabilities for tuples that follow specific rules. In this tutorial, we'll explore how tuple comparison works in Swift, when you can use it, and its limitations.

Tuple comparison is particularly useful when you need to compare multiple values at once or when working with sorting operations that involve multiple criteria. Understanding these comparison rules will help you write more concise and readable code.

## Basic Tuple Comparison

Swift allows you to compare tuples using the standard comparison operators: `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`, `==`, and `!=`. The comparison is done element by element, from left to right.

### Equality Comparison (`==` and `!=`)

To compare if two tuples are equal, Swift checks if all corresponding elements are equal:

```swift
let tuple1 = (1, "apple")
let tuple2 = (1, "apple")
let tuple3 = (2, "apple")

print(tuple1 == tuple2) // Output: true
print(tuple1 == tuple3) // Output: false
print(tuple1 != tuple3) // Output: true
```

For equality comparison (`==` and `!=`), all elements in the tuples must be of types that conform to the `Equatable` protocol.

## Ordered Comparison

Swift performs tuple comparison in a lexicographical order, which means:

1. It compares the first elements of both tuples
2. If they're equal, it continues with the next elements
3. This continues until it finds elements that aren't equal or reaches the end

```swift
let score1 = (5, 10)
let score2 = (5, 8)
let score3 = (6, 3)

print(score1 > score2) // Output: true (first elements are equal, but 10 > 8)
print(score1 < score3) // Output: true (5 < 6, so it doesn't check the second elements)
```

This comparison behavior is similar to how words are ordered in a dictionary.

## Tuple Comparison Rules and Requirements

For tuple comparison to work correctly, the following requirements must be met:

1. **Comparable Elements**: For ordered comparisons (`<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`), all corresponding elements must conform to the `Comparable` protocol.
2. **Same Type and Arity**: Both tuples must have the same number of elements and the corresponding elements must be of the same type.
3. **Maximum 6 Elements**: Swift only supports comparison for tuples with up to 6 elements.

Let's see what happens when these requirements aren't met:

```swift
// This will compile - all elements conform to Comparable
let a = (1, "apple", 3.14)
let b = (1, "banana", 2.71)
print(a < b) // Output: true (first elements are equal, "apple" < "banana")

// This will NOT compile - Bool doesn't conform to Comparable
let c = (1, true)
let d = (1, false)
// print(c < d) // Error: Binary operator '<' cannot be applied to operands of type '(Int, Bool)'

// This will NOT compile - different tuple types
let e = (1, "apple")
let f = ("apple", 1)
// print(e < f) // Error: Binary operator '<' cannot be applied to operands of type '(Int, String)' and '(String, Int)'
```

## Practical Applications

### Sorting Arrays of Tuples

One common use case for tuple comparison is sorting collections of tuples:

```swift
// Students with (name, score, age)
var students = [
    ("Alex", 85, 19),
    ("Emma", 92, 20),
    ("Michael", 78, 18),
    ("Emma", 92, 19)
]

// Sort by score (descending), then by age (ascending), then by name
students.sort { 
    if $0.1 != $1.1 {
        return $0.1 > $1.1  // First sort by score (descending)
    } else if $0.2 != $1.2 {
        return $0.2 < $1.2  // Then by age (ascending)
    } else {
        return $0.0 < $1.0  // Finally by name (ascending)
    }
}

// We can simplify this using tuple comparison
students.sort {
    // Sort by -score (to make it descending), age, name
    (-$0.1, $0.2, $0.0) < (-$1.1, $1.2, $1.0)
}

print("Sorted students:")
for student in students {
    print("\(student.0): score \(student.1), age \(student.2)")
}

// Output:
// Sorted students:
// Emma: score 92, age 19
// Emma: score 92, age 20
// Alex: score 85, age 19
// Michael: score 78, age 18
```

### Multi-criteria Comparison

Tuples are excellent for comparing multiple properties at once:

```swift
struct Product {
    let name: String
    let price: Double
    let rating: Double
    
    func isBetterDeal(than other: Product) -> Bool {
        // A product is a better deal if it has a lower price and a higher rating
        // Or if the price is equal, it should have a higher rating
        return (price, -rating) < (other.price, -other.rating)
    }
}

let product1 = Product(name: "Standard Widget", price: 19.99, rating: 4.2)
let product2 = Product(name: "Premium Widget", price: 19.99, rating: 4.7)
let product3 = Product(name: "Deluxe Widget", price: 24.99, rating: 4.9)

print(product1.isBetterDeal(than: product2)) // Output: false
print(product2.isBetterDeal(than: product3)) // Output: true
```

### Comparing Version Numbers

Tuple comparison is perfect for version comparisons:

```swift
typealias Version = (major: Int, minor: Int, patch: Int)

func isVersionNewer(_ v1: Version, than v2: Version) -> Bool {
    return v1 > v2  // Simple tuple comparison works perfectly
}

let currentVersion: Version = (2, 5, 1)
let newVersion: Version = (2, 6, 0)
let oldVersion: Version = (1, 9, 5)

print(isVersionNewer(newVersion, than: currentVersion)) // Output: true
print(isVersionNewer(oldVersion, than: currentVersion)) // Output: false
```

## Limitations and Workarounds

### Comparing Tuples with More Than 6 Elements

Swift only supports comparison for tuples with up to 6 elements. If you need to compare larger tuples, you'll need to implement your own comparison:

```swift
let bigTuple1 = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7)
let bigTuple2 = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8)

// This won't work directly:
// print(bigTuple1 < bigTuple2)

// Instead, create a manual comparison function:
func compareLargeTuples(_ t1: (Int, Int, Int, Int, Int, Int, Int), 
                         _ t2: (Int, Int, Int, Int, Int, Int, Int)) -> Bool {
    // Compare first 6 elements as a tuple
    let firstSix1 = (t1.0, t1.1, t1.2, t1.3, t1.4, t1.5)
    let firstSix2 = (t2.0, t2.1, t2.2, t2.3, t2.4, t2.5)
    
    if firstSix1 != firstSix2 {
        return firstSix1 < firstSix2
    }
    
    // If first 6 are equal, compare the 7th
    return t1.6 < t2.6
}

print(compareLargeTuples(bigTuple1, bigTuple2)) // Output: true
```

### Comparing Tuples with Non-Comparable Elements

For tuples containing non-`Comparable` types, you must implement custom comparison logic:

```swift
struct CustomType {
    let value: Int
}

let tuple1 = (1, CustomType(value: 5))
let tuple2 = (1, CustomType(value: 10))

// This won't compile:
// print(tuple1 < tuple2)

// Instead, implement custom comparison:
func compareCustomTuples(_ t1: (Int, CustomType), _ t2: (Int, CustomType)) -> Bool {
    if t1.0 != t2.0 {
        return t1.0 < t2.0
    }
    return t1.1.value < t2.1.value
}

print(compareCustomTuples(tuple1, tuple2)) // Output: true
```

## Summary

Swift tuple comparison provides a powerful way to compare multiple values in a single operation. Tuples are compared element by element from left to right, following lexicographical order.

Key points to remember:
- Tuple comparison works out of the box for tuples where all elements conform to the `Comparable` protocol
- Equality comparison (`==`, `!=`) requires elements to conform to `Equatable`
- Swift supports comparison for tuples with up to 6 elements
- Tuple comparison is especially useful for multi-criteria sorting and comparison operations

By mastering tuple comparison, you can write more concise and expressive code, particularly when dealing with sorting and filtering operations involving multiple criteria.

## Exercises

1. Create a function that compares two student records (name, GPA, age) and sorts them by GPA (descending), then by age (ascending).
2. Implement a custom comparison for a tuple containing a `String` and a custom `UserRole` enum that has a specific precedence order.
3. Write a function that sorts an array of `(title: String, priority: Int, dueDate: Date)` tuples representing tasks in a to-do list.
4. Create a program that compares semantic versions (like "2.1.3" vs "2.0.5") by splitting them into tuples and comparing them.
