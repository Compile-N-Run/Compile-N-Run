# Swift Performance Optimization

## Introduction

Performance optimization is a critical aspect of Swift development that can significantly impact your app's user experience. Optimized code runs faster, uses less battery power, and provides a smoother experience for users. This guide will walk you through essential techniques to improve your Swift code's performance, with a special focus on memory management considerations.

As a beginner, you might wonder why you need to worry about performance so early in your learning journey. The answer is simple: developing good habits from the start will help you write better code naturally as you grow as a developer.

## Why Performance Matters

Before diving into optimization techniques, let's understand why performance matters:

- **Better User Experience**: Fast apps feel more responsive and professional
- **Lower Battery Consumption**: Optimized code uses less CPU time and power
- **Reduced Memory Usage**: Efficient code allows your app to run on more devices
- **App Store Success**: Performant apps get better reviews and more downloads

## Memory Management Basics Review

Swift uses Automatic Reference Counting (ARC) to track and manage memory usage. Before exploring optimization techniques, let's quickly review how Swift manages memory:

```swift
class Person {
    var name: String
    
    init(name: String) {
        self.name = name
        print("\(name) is initialized")
    }
    
    deinit {
        print("\(name) is being deallocated")
    }
}

// Creating a new reference
var person1: Person? = Person(name: "John")
// Output: John is initialized

// Creating another reference to the same object
var person2 = person1
// No output - just another reference to the same object

// Breaking the first reference
person1 = nil
// No output - object still has one reference

// Breaking the second reference
person2 = nil
// Output: John is being deallocated
```

## Common Performance Issues in Swift

### 1. Memory Leaks

Memory leaks occur when objects are no longer needed but can't be deallocated because they're still referenced somewhere in your code.

#### Strong Reference Cycles

One of the most common causes of memory leaks in Swift:

```swift
class Employee {
    var name: String
    var department: Department?
    
    init(name: String) {
        self.name = name
        print("\(name) is initialized")
    }
    
    deinit {
        print("\(name) is being deallocated")
    }
}

class Department {
    var name: String
    var head: Employee?
    
    init(name: String) {
        self.name = name
        print("Department \(name) is initialized")
    }
    
    deinit {
        print("Department \(name) is being deallocated")
    }
}

// Create instances
var bob: Employee? = Employee(name: "Bob")
var engineering: Department? = Department(name: "Engineering")

// Create strong reference cycle
bob!.department = engineering
engineering!.head = bob

// Try to deallocate
bob = nil
engineering = nil

// No deallocation occurs! Memory leak!
```

#### Solving with Weak References

```swift
class Employee {
    var name: String
    var department: Department?
    
    init(name: String) {
        self.name = name
        print("\(name) is initialized")
    }
    
    deinit {
        print("\(name) is being deallocated")
    }
}

class Department {
    var name: String
    weak var head: Employee? // Using weak reference
    
    init(name: String) {
        self.name = name
        print("Department \(name) is initialized")
    }
    
    deinit {
        print("Department \(name) is being deallocated")
    }
}

// Create instances
var bob: Employee? = Employee(name: "Bob")
var engineering: Department? = Department(name: "Engineering")

// Create relationship without strong reference cycle
bob!.department = engineering
engineering!.head = bob

// Try to deallocate
bob = nil
// Output: Bob is being deallocated
engineering = nil
// Output: Department Engineering is being deallocated
```

### 2. Large Object Allocations

Creating large objects, especially in performance-critical paths, can cause performance issues:

```swift
// Inefficient: Creating large array inside loop
func processData(iterations: Int) -> [Int] {
    var result = [Int]()
    
    for i in 0..<iterations {
        var largeArray = [Int](repeating: 0, count: 10000) // Bad practice
        largeArray[0] = i
        result.append(largeArray[0])
    }
    
    return result
}
```

A more efficient approach:

```swift
// Better: Move large allocation outside loop
func processDataOptimized(iterations: Int) -> [Int] {
    var result = [Int]()
    var largeArray = [Int](repeating: 0, count: 10000) // Allocated once
    
    for i in 0..<iterations {
        largeArray[0] = i
        result.append(largeArray[0])
    }
    
    return result
}
```

### 3. Excessive String Concatenation

String operations are more expensive than you might think:

```swift
// Inefficient string concatenation
func buildReport(entries: [String]) -> String {
    var report = ""
    
    for entry in entries {
        report += entry + "\n" // Creates a new string each time
    }
    
    return report
}
```

More efficient approach:

```swift
// Better: Using String's append method or String interpolation
func buildReportOptimized(entries: [String]) -> String {
    var report = ""
    
    for entry in entries {
        report.append(entry)
        report.append("\n")
    }
    
    return report
}

// Even better for large collections: using joined()
func buildReportBest(entries: [String]) -> String {
    return entries.joined(separator: "\n")
}
```

## Performance Optimization Techniques

### 1. Use Value Types Appropriately

Swift structs (value types) can be more efficient than classes (reference types) for simple data:

```swift
// Using a struct for simple data
struct Point {
    var x: Double
    var y: Double
}

// More efficient than an equivalent class for simple operations
let points = (0..<1000).map { i in
    Point(x: Double(i), y: Double(i * 2))
}
```

### 2. Avoid Excessive Optionals

Optionals add overhead. Use them only when needed:

```swift
// Less efficient - using optionals when not needed
func processValues(values: [Int?]) -> Int {
    var sum = 0
    for value in values {
        if let unwrapped = value {
            sum += unwrapped
        }
    }
    return sum
}

// More efficient - no optionals needed
func processValuesOptimized(values: [Int]) -> Int {
    var sum = 0
    for value in values {
        sum += value
    }
    return sum
}
```

### 3. Use Lazy Properties

Lazy properties are initialized only when first accessed:

```swift
class DataProcessor {
    // This expensive operation only runs when expensiveData is first accessed
    lazy var expensiveData: [Int] = {
        print("Generating expensive data...")
        var data = [Int]()
        for i in 0..<10000 {
            data.append(i * i)
        }
        return data
    }()
    
    func simpleOperation() {
        print("Performing simple operation")
    }
    
    func complexOperation() {
        print("Accessing expensive data")
        let firstItem = expensiveData[0]
        print("First item: \(firstItem)")
    }
}

let processor = DataProcessor()
processor.simpleOperation()
// Output: Performing simple operation
// Note: expensiveData not computed yet

processor.complexOperation()
// Output:
// Accessing expensive data
// Generating expensive data...
// First item: 0
```

### 4. Optimize Collection Operations

Swift's functional methods on collections can be more readable, but sometimes less efficient:

```swift
// Less efficient for large arrays
func findLargeNumbers(in numbers: [Int]) -> [Int] {
    return numbers.filter { $0 > 100 }.map { $0 * 2 }
}

// More efficient for large arrays - single pass
func findLargeNumbersOptimized(in numbers: [Int]) -> [Int] {
    var result = [Int]()
    for number in numbers {
        if number > 100 {
            result.append(number * 2)
        }
    }
    return result
}
```

### 5. Capacity Hints for Collections

Pre-allocating capacity can significantly improve performance:

```swift
// Without capacity hint
func buildArrayWithoutHint(size: Int) -> [Int] {
    var numbers = [Int]()
    for i in 0..<size {
        numbers.append(i)  // May cause multiple reallocations
    }
    return numbers
}

// With capacity hint
func buildArrayWithHint(size: Int) -> [Int] {
    var numbers = [Int]()
    numbers.reserveCapacity(size)  // Single allocation
    for i in 0..<size {
        numbers.append(i)
    }
    return numbers
}
```

## Measuring Performance

### Using CFAbsoluteTimeGetCurrent()

```swift
import Foundation

func measureTime(_ operation: () -> Void) -> TimeInterval {
    let startTime = CFAbsoluteTimeGetCurrent()
    operation()
    let endTime = CFAbsoluteTimeGetCurrent()
    return endTime - startTime
}

// Example usage
let time = measureTime {
    _ = (0..<100000).map { $0 * $0 }
}

print("Operation took \(time) seconds")
// Output: Operation took 0.123 seconds (actual time will vary)
```

### Using XCTest for Performance Testing

In your test files, you can use XCTest's measure method:

```swift
import XCTest

class PerformanceTests: XCTestCase {
    func testArrayPerformance() {
        measure {
            var array = [Int]()
            for i in 0..<10000 {
                array.append(i)
            }
        }
    }
    
    func testArrayPerformanceWithHint() {
        measure {
            var array = [Int]()
            array.reserveCapacity(10000)
            for i in 0..<10000 {
                array.append(i)
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Real-World Optimization Example: Image Processing App

Let's optimize a simple image processing function:

```swift
// Original inefficient version
func applyFilter(to images: [UIImage]) -> [UIImage] {
    var processedImages = [UIImage]()
    
    for image in images {
        // Create a new context each time (expensive)
        UIGraphicsBeginImageContext(image.size)
        image.draw(at: CGPoint.zero)
        
        // Apply simple brightness effect
        if let context = UIGraphicsGetCurrentContext() {
            context.setAlpha(0.7) // 70% brightness
            context.setBlendMode(.sourceAtop)
            context.setFillColor(UIColor.white.cgColor)
            context.fill(CGRect(origin: .zero, size: image.size))
        }
        
        let processedImage = UIGraphicsGetImageFromCurrentImageContext()
        UIGraphicsEndImageContext()
        
        if let processedImage = processedImage {
            processedImages.append(processedImage)
        }
    }
    
    return processedImages
}
```

Now let's optimize it:

```swift
// Optimized version
func applyFilterOptimized(to images: [UIImage]) -> [UIImage] {
    // Pre-allocate array with capacity
    var processedImages = [UIImage]()
    processedImages.reserveCapacity(images.count)
    
    // Cache size for common image dimensions
    var cachedSize: CGSize?
    
    for image in images {
        // Reuse context when possible
        if cachedSize != image.size {
            if cachedSize != nil {
                UIGraphicsEndImageContext()
            }
            UIGraphicsBeginImageContext(image.size)
            cachedSize = image.size
        }
        
        image.draw(at: CGPoint.zero)
        
        // Apply simple brightness effect
        if let context = UIGraphicsGetCurrentContext() {
            context.setAlpha(0.7)
            context.setBlendMode(.sourceAtop)
            context.setFillColor(UIColor.white.cgColor)
            context.fill(CGRect(origin: .zero, size: image.size))
        }
        
        if let processedImage = UIGraphicsGetImageFromCurrentImageContext() {
            processedImages.append(processedImage)
        }
        
        // Clear for next iteration but don't deallocate context
        UIGraphicsBeginImageContextWithOptions(image.size, false, 0)
    }
    
    // Clean up
    UIGraphicsEndImageContext()
    
    return processedImages
}
```

## Summary

In this guide, we've covered essential performance optimization techniques for Swift, with a focus on memory management:

1. **Avoid Memory Leaks** - Use weak and unowned references to break reference cycles
2. **Optimize Object Allocation** - Minimize large object creations in performance-critical paths
3. **Efficient Collection Operations** - Use appropriate algorithms and pre-allocate capacity
4. **Value vs Reference Types** - Choose structs for simple data structures
5. **Lazy Loading** - Initialize expensive properties only when needed
6. **Measurement Tools** - Use appropriate tools to identify bottlenecks

Remember that premature optimization can lead to unnecessary complexity. Always start by writing clear, correct code, then measure performance to identify bottlenecks before optimizing.

## Practice Exercises

1. **Memory Leak Detection**: Create a class with a reference cycle, then fix it using weak references.

2. **String Performance**: Write a function that builds a report from thousands of strings in the most efficient way.

3. **Collection Optimization**: Optimize a function that processes a large array by pre-allocating memory and minimizing iterations.

4. **Benchmark Comparison**: Create two versions of a function (one using high-level Swift features, another using more manual operations) and compare their performance.
