# Swift Substring

When working with strings in Swift, you'll often need to extract portions of a stringâ€”these portions are called "substrings." In this tutorial, we'll explore Swift's powerful substring capabilities, which allow you to manipulate text efficiently.

## Introduction to Substrings

A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string. In Swift, substrings are represented by the `Substring` type, which is different from `String` but shares many of the same methods and properties.

The key difference is that a substring maintains a reference to the original string it was created from, which makes substring operations very efficient. However, this means substrings aren't meant for long-term storage.

## Creating Substrings in Swift

Swift offers several ways to extract substrings from strings:

### 1. Using String Indices

Swift strings use indices instead of integer positions to access characters:

```swift
let greeting = "Hello, Swift!"
let startIndex = greeting.index(greeting.startIndex, offsetBy: 7)
let endIndex = greeting.index(greeting.startIndex, offsetBy: 12)
let substring = greeting[startIndex..<endIndex]

print(substring) // Output: Swift
```

### 2. Using `prefix` and `suffix`

To extract characters from the beginning or end of a string:

```swift
let message = "Swift is awesome"

// Get first 5 characters
let prefix = message.prefix(5)
print(prefix) // Output: Swift

// Get last 7 characters
let suffix = message.suffix(7)
print(suffix) // Output: awesome
```

### 3. Using `dropFirst` and `dropLast`

To remove characters from the beginning or end of a string:

```swift
let phrase = "Swift Programming"

// Remove first 6 characters
let afterDropping = phrase.dropFirst(6)
print(afterDropping) // Output: Programming

// Remove last 11 characters
let beforeEnd = phrase.dropLast(11)
print(beforeEnd) // Output: Swift
```

## Converting Between String and Substring

It's important to understand that `Substring` is a temporary view into a string. For long-term storage, you should convert a substring back to a string:

```swift
let fullText = "Learn Swift Programming"
let swiftSubstring = fullText.dropFirst(6).prefix(5)
print(swiftSubstring) // Output: Swift

// Convert substring to string for long-term storage
let swiftString = String(swiftSubstring)
print(swiftString) // Output: Swift
```

## Practical Examples of Substring Operations

### Example 1: Extracting a Username from an Email

```swift
let email = "user.name@example.com"

if let atIndex = email.firstIndex(of: "@") {
    let username = email[..<atIndex]
    print("Username: \(username)") // Output: user.name
    
    // Convert to String for storage
    let usernameString = String(username)
    print("Username as String: \(usernameString)") // Output: user.name
}
```

### Example 2: Extracting the First Line from a Multi-line Text

```swift
let multilineText = """
First line of text.
Second line of text.
Third line of text.
"""

if let newlineIndex = multilineText.firstIndex(of: "\n") {
    let firstLine = multilineText[..<newlineIndex]
    print("First line: \(firstLine)") // Output: First line of text.
}
```

### Example 3: Creating a URL-friendly Slug from a Title

```swift
func createSlug(from title: String) -> String {
    let lowercased = title.lowercased()
    let alphanumerics = lowercased.filter { $0.isLetter || $0.isNumber || $0 == " " }
    return alphanumerics.replacingOccurrences(of: " ", with: "-")
}

let articleTitle = "Swift Substring Tutorial: Learn How to Use Substrings!"
let slug = createSlug(from: articleTitle)
print("URL slug: \(slug)") // Output: swift-substring-tutorial-learn-how-to-use-substrings
```

## Performance Considerations

Working with substrings in Swift is efficient for several reasons:

1. Substrings share storage with the original string, so creating a substring is a lightweight operation.
2. No memory is allocated when creating a substring, making the operation very fast.
3. When you convert a substring to a string, Swift copies the characters to ensure the memory is properly managed.

However, be careful when working with very large strings, as keeping a small substring can prevent the entire original string from being deallocated if the substring is still in use.

```swift
func processText() {
    // Bad practice with large text
    let largeText = loadVeryLargeText() // Imagine this is many megabytes
    let firstWord = largeText.prefix(while: { $0 != " " })
    saveForLaterUse(firstWord) // This keeps the entire largeText in memory!
    
    // Better approach
    let firstWordString = String(largeText.prefix(while: { $0 != " " }))
    saveForLaterUse(firstWordString) // Only keeps the first word in memory
}
```

## Common Use Cases for Substrings

- **Text processing**: Extracting specific portions of text for analysis
- **Form validation**: Checking parts of user input for validation
- **Data parsing**: Breaking down structured text into meaningful components
- **Text truncation**: Creating previews of longer text
- **String manipulation**: Removing prefixes/suffixes or trimming whitespace

## Summary

Substrings in Swift provide an efficient way to work with portions of strings. Here's what we've learned:

- Swift's `Substring` type offers a memory-efficient view into a string
- Various methods to create substrings: indices, prefix/suffix, and dropFirst/dropLast
- The importance of converting substrings to strings for long-term storage
- Practical examples of substring manipulation in real-world scenarios

Working proficiently with substrings is an essential skill for Swift developers, allowing you to process and manipulate text efficiently.

## Exercises

1. Write a function that extracts the domain name from a URL string
2. Create a function that truncates a string to a specific length and adds "..." if it was truncated
3. Write a program that extracts all hashtags (#example) from a social media post
4. Implement a function that splits a full name into first name and last name components
5. Create a function that extracts the file extension from a filename
