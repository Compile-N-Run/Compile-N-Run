# Swift String Performance

Swift strings are powerful and Unicode-correct, but this comes with performance considerations that every Swift developer should understand. This guide will help you optimize your string operations and understand the performance characteristics that make Swift strings unique.

## Introduction to Swift String Performance

Swift's `String` type is designed to be Unicode-correct, which means it can represent any character from any language. However, this also means that seemingly simple operations can be more complex than they appear. Understanding how Swift strings work under the hood will help you write more efficient code.

String performance is especially important in:
- Apps processing large text data
- Real-time text manipulation
- Loops with multiple string operations
- Mobile apps where CPU and memory efficiency matters

## Swift String Memory Layout

### The Basics

Swift strings are not simple arrays of characters. Instead, they use a complex storage model that optimizes for different scenarios.

```swift
let shortString = "Hi"
let longString = String(repeating: "A", count: 100)

print(MemoryLayout.size(ofValue: shortString)) // Not the actual size of content
print(MemoryLayout.size(ofValue: longString))  // Same size, different storage
```

Swift strings have:

1. **Small String Optimization** - Short strings (up to 15 bytes on 64-bit systems) are stored inline without additional memory allocation
2. **Copy-on-Write Semantics** - Copying strings is cheap until you modify one of the copies
3. **UTF-8 Encoding** - Internally, Swift strings use UTF-8 as the preferred encoding

### String Views

Swift offers multiple views of the same string content:

```swift
let hello = "Hello, ðŸŒŽ!"

print(hello.count)                  // 9 (characters)
print(hello.utf8.count)             // 13 (UTF-8 code units)
print(hello.utf16.count)            // 11 (UTF-16 code units) 
print(hello.unicodeScalars.count)   // 10 (Unicode scalar values)
```

Accessing the right view for your operation can dramatically improve performance.

## Performance Pitfalls

### Random Access is O(n)

Unlike arrays, strings don't provide constant-time random access:

```swift
let alphabet = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ"

// SLOW: O(n) operation - must traverse from start
let tenthChar = alphabet[alphabet.index(alphabet.startIndex, offsetBy: 10)]

print(tenthChar) // "K"
```

This is because Swift strings are collections of Character values, where each Character can be composed of multiple Unicode scalars of varying byte lengths.

### Indexing Performance

When you need to perform multiple operations at different positions:

```swift
let text = "This is a sample text for indexing performance."

// INEFFICIENT: Recalculating index each time
for i in 0..<5 {
    let index = text.index(text.startIndex, offsetBy: i)
    print(text[index])
}

// BETTER: Calculate once and advance
var index = text.startIndex
for _ in 0..<5 {
    print(text[index])
    index = text.index(after: index)
}
```

The second approach avoids traversing from the beginning each time.

### String Concatenation

String concatenation can lead to many allocations if not done efficiently:

```swift
// INEFFICIENT: Creates many intermediate strings
var result = ""
for i in 1...1000 {
    result += String(i)
}

// BETTER: Uses a single buffer that grows as needed
var efficientResult = ""
efficientResult.reserveCapacity(10000) // Approximate capacity
for i in 1...1000 {
    efficientResult.append(contentsOf: String(i))
}

// ALSO GOOD: Using string interpolation
let interpolatedResult = (1...1000).map { "\($0)" }.joined()
```

## Performance Optimization Techniques

### 1. Use String Views Appropriately

Choose the right string view for your operation:

```swift
let text = "Hello, Swift!"

// If searching for ASCII characters, use utf8 for better performance
if let indexOfS = text.utf8.firstIndex(of: UInt8(ascii: "S")) {
    let position = text.utf8.distance(from: text.utf8.startIndex, to: indexOfS)
    print("'S' is at position \(position)") // 'S' is at position 7
}
```

### 2. Leverage `reserveCapacity` for Building Strings

When you know you'll be building a large string:

```swift
// With reserveCapacity:
var optimized = ""
optimized.reserveCapacity(10000)

// Without reserveCapacity:
var unoptimized = ""

// The optimized version will require fewer reallocations
```

### 3. Use `NSString` Where Appropriate

For certain operations, `NSString` might be faster:

```swift
let swiftString = "This is a test string for performance comparison"
let nsString = swiftString as NSString

// NSString has O(1) length and character access
let length = nsString.length
let char = nsString.character(at: 5)

print("Length: \(length), Character at index 5: \(Character(UnicodeScalar(char)!))")
// Output: Length: 47, Character at index 5: s
```

Remember that `NSString` doesn't handle Unicode as correctly as Swift's `String`.

### 4. Substring Performance

Substrings in Swift share storage with the original string:

```swift
let originalString = "This is a very long string that we want to take a substring from"
let substring = originalString.prefix(10)

print(substring) // "This is a "
```

Substrings are efficient for temporary operations, but be careful not to hold them for too long as they keep the entire original string in memory.

## Real-world Applications

### Example 1: Processing Large Text Files

When processing large text files, use buffered reading and line-by-line processing:

```swift
if let path = Bundle.main.path(forResource: "large_text", ofType: "txt") {
    let fileURL = URL(fileURLWithPath: path)
    
    do {
        // Process line by line instead of loading entire file
        try String(contentsOf: fileURL).enumerateLines { line, _ in
            // Process each line here
            if line.contains("IMPORTANT") {
                print("Found important line: \(line)")
            }
        }
    } catch {
        print("Error reading file: \(error)")
    }
}
```

### Example 2: Efficient Text Search

For searching text efficiently:

```swift
extension String {
    func efficientContains(substring: String) -> Bool {
        // For ASCII strings, utf8 view is faster
        if substring.allSatisfy({ $0.isASCII }) && self.allSatisfy({ $0.isASCII }) {
            return self.utf8.contains(substring.utf8)
        } else {
            return self.contains(substring)
        }
    }
}

let haystack = "This is a long text where we want to find a needle"
let needle = "needle"

let found = haystack.efficientContains(substring: needle)
print("Found needle: \(found)") // Found needle: true
```

### Example 3: Building a Log Processor

When handling logs with timestamps and messages:

```swift
struct LogEntry {
    let timestamp: String
    let level: String
    let message: String
}

func parseLogLine(_ line: String) -> LogEntry? {
    // Use ranges rather than splitting the string
    guard let timestampRange = line.range(of: #"^\[\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2} \d{2}:\d{2}:\d{2}\]"#, 
                                          options: .regularExpression),
          let levelRange = line.range(of: #"\b(INFO|WARNING|ERROR)\b"#, 
                                      options: .regularExpression) else {
        return nil
    }
    
    let timestamp = String(line[timestampRange]).trimmingCharacters(in: CharacterSet(charactersIn: "[]"))
    let level = String(line[levelRange])
    
    // Find message start (after level)
    let messageStart = line.index(levelRange.upperBound, offsetBy: 1)
    let message = String(line[messageStart...]).trimmingCharacters(in: .whitespacesAndNewlines)
    
    return LogEntry(timestamp: timestamp, level: level, message: message)
}

// Example usage
let logLine = "[2023-10-10 14:25:36] ERROR Database connection failed: timeout"
if let entry = parseLogLine(logLine) {
    print("Timestamp: \(entry.timestamp)")
    print("Level: \(entry.level)")
    print("Message: \(entry.message)")
}
// Output:
// Timestamp: 2023-10-10 14:25:36
// Level: ERROR
// Message: Database connection failed: timeout
```

## Measuring String Performance

To make informed decisions, you should measure performance:

```swift
import Foundation

func measureTime(_ operation: () -> Void) -> TimeInterval {
    let start = Date()
    operation()
    return Date().timeIntervalSince(start)
}

// Compare two string concatenation approaches
let iterations = 100_000

let time1 = measureTime {
    var s1 = ""
    for i in 0..<iterations {
        s1 += String(i)
    }
}

let time2 = measureTime {
    var s2 = ""
    s2.reserveCapacity(iterations * 5) // Approximate size
    for i in 0..<iterations {
        s2.append(contentsOf: String(i))
    }
}

print("Using += operator: \(time1) seconds")
print("Using append with reserveCapacity: \(time2) seconds")
print("Performance improvement: \(time1/time2)x faster")
```

## Summary

Swift strings are designed for correctness over raw performance, but by understanding how they work, you can write code that is both correct and efficient:

- Remember that Swift strings aren't randomly accessible in constant time
- Use appropriate string views for different operations
- Leverage `reserveCapacity` when building strings
- Be mindful of string concatenation in loops
- Use substrings for temporary operations
- Consider using `NSString` for simple ASCII operations

Balancing Unicode correctness with performance is key to effective string handling in Swift.
