# Swift Unicode Representation

When working with strings in Swift, understanding how Unicode is represented is crucial for proper text handling. This guide explains how Swift implements Unicode support and how you can work with different character encodings in your applications.

## Introduction to Unicode in Swift

Unicode is an international standard for representing text across different languages and writing systems. Swift provides full Unicode support, allowing your applications to handle text in virtually any language and use a wide range of special characters and emoji.

Unlike some other programming languages that treat strings as simple arrays of bytes or characters, Swift strings are collections of Unicode characters, where each character is a **grapheme cluster** - what a human reader would consider a single character.

## Unicode Fundamentals

Before diving into Swift's implementation, let's understand a few key Unicode concepts:

- **Code Point**: A unique number assigned to each Unicode character (e.g., `U+0061` for lowercase "a")
- **Code Unit**: The basic unit used to encode code points (e.g., 8-bit, 16-bit, or 32-bit units)
- **Grapheme Cluster**: One or more code points that combine to form what a user perceives as a single character

## Swift's Unicode Representation

### String and Character Types

In Swift, strings are represented by the `String` type, and individual characters by the `Character` type:

```swift
let greeting = "Hello" // String
let character: Character = "H" // Character
```

Under the hood, Swift strings are stored as a collection of Unicode scalars.

### Unicode Scalars

Swift provides direct access to Unicode scalars through the `String.UnicodeScalarView`:

```swift
let dogString = "Dog‼🐶"

for unicodeScalar in dogString.unicodeScalars {
    print("Unicode scalar \(unicodeScalar) has value \(unicodeScalar.value)")
}

// Output:
// Unicode scalar D has value 68
// Unicode scalar o has value 111
// Unicode scalar g has value 103
// Unicode scalar ‼ has value 8252
// Unicode scalar 🐶 has value 128054
```

### UTF-16 Representation

You can access the UTF-16 representation of a string through its `utf16` property:

```swift
let dogString = "Dog‼🐶"

print("UTF-16 code units: ", terminator: "")
for codeUnit in dogString.utf16 {
    print("\(codeUnit) ", terminator: "")
}
// Output: UTF-16 code units: 68 111 103 8252 55357 56374 
```

Notice how the dog emoji 🐶 requires two UTF-16 code units (a surrogate pair).

### UTF-8 Representation

Similarly, you can access the UTF-8 representation:

```swift
let dogString = "Dog‼🐶"

print("UTF-8 code units: ", terminator: "")
for codeUnit in dogString.utf8 {
    print("\(codeUnit) ", terminator: "")
}
// Output: UTF-8 code units: 68 111 103 226 128 188 240 159 144 182 
```

The emoji requires four UTF-8 code units.

## Grapheme Clusters in Swift

Swift treats characters as extended grapheme clusters, which means a single `Character` value can represent multiple Unicode scalars that combine to form a single human-readable character:

```swift
let eAcute: Character = "\u{E9}" // é
let combinedEAcute: Character = "\u{65}\u{301}" // e followed by ́

print(eAcute) // é
print(combinedEAcute) // é
print(eAcute == combinedEAcute) // true
```

Even though `eAcute` and `combinedEAcute` are constructed differently (one using a single Unicode scalar and the other using two), Swift recognizes them as the same character.

## Working with Unicode in Swift

### Counting Characters

Because Swift counts characters as grapheme clusters, the length of a string might differ from what you'd expect in languages that count code units:

```swift
let cafe = "café"
print("The length of \(cafe) is \(cafe.count) characters")
// Output: The length of café is 4 characters

// Using UTF-16 code units
print("The UTF-16 length of \(cafe) is \(cafe.utf16.count) code units")
// Output: The UTF-16 length of café is 5 code units (if é is represented as a combining character)
```

### String Indices

Since characters in Swift can occupy varying amounts of memory, Swift strings can't be indexed using integers:

```swift
let greeting = "Hello, world!"
let index = greeting.index(greeting.startIndex, offsetBy: 7)
let character = greeting[index] // w
```

### Unicode Escapes in String Literals

Swift allows you to include Unicode scalars directly in string literals using escape sequences:

```swift
let sparklingHeart = "\u{1F496}" // 💖
print(sparklingHeart) // 💖

let blackHeart = "\u{2665}" // ♥
print(blackHeart) // ♥

// Multiple scalars in one character
let familyEmoji = "\u{1F468}\u{200D}\u{1F469}\u{200D}\u{1F467}\u{200D}\u{1F466}" // 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦
print(familyEmoji) // 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦
```

## Practical Examples

### 1. Handling User Input in Different Languages

```swift
func validateName(_ name: String) -> Bool {
    // Check if the name has at least 2 characters
    if name.count < 2 {
        return false
    }
    
    // Additional validation could go here
    return true
}

let japaneseName = "山田太郎"
let arabicName = "محمد علي"

print("Japanese name valid: \(validateName(japaneseName))") // true
print("Arabic name valid: \(validateName(arabicName))") // true
```

### 2. Creating a Simple Emoji Analyzer

```swift
func analyzeEmoji(_ text: String) -> (count: Int, description: String) {
    let emojiRanges = [
        0x1F600...0x1F64F, // Emoticons
        0x1F300...0x1F5FF, // Misc Symbols and Pictographs
        0x1F680...0x1F6FF, // Transport and Map
        0x2600...0x26FF,   // Misc symbols
        0x2700...0x27BF,   // Dingbats
        0x1F900...0x1F9FF  // Supplemental Symbols and Pictographs
    ]
    
    var emojiCount = 0
    var containsEmoticon = false
    var containsTransport = false
    
    for scalar in text.unicodeScalars {
        let value = scalar.value
        if emojiRanges[0].contains(value) {
            containsEmoticon = true
            emojiCount += 1
        } else if emojiRanges[2].contains(value) {
            containsTransport = true
            emojiCount += 1
        } else if emojiRanges[1].contains(value) || 
                  emojiRanges[3].contains(value) || 
                  emojiRanges[4].contains(value) || 
                  emojiRanges[5].contains(value) {
            emojiCount += 1
        }
    }
    
    var description = "Contains \(emojiCount) emoji"
    if containsEmoticon {
        description += ", includes emoticons"
    }
    if containsTransport {
        description += ", includes transport symbols"
    }
    
    return (emojiCount, description)
}

let message = "I'm traveling by 🚗 and feeling 😊!"
let result = analyzeEmoji(message)
print(result.description)
// Output: Contains 2 emoji, includes emoticons, includes transport symbols
```

### 3. String Transformation for Internationalization

```swift
func transformToUppercase(_ text: String) -> String {
    return text.uppercased()
}

let englishGreeting = "hello"
let turkishGreeting = "merhaba"

print(transformToUppercase(englishGreeting)) // "HELLO"
print(transformToUppercase(turkishGreeting)) // "MERHABA"

// Turkish uppercase has special handling for the letter 'i'
// Swift handles this correctly
let turkishWord = "istanbul"
print(turkishWord.uppercased(with: Locale(identifier: "en"))) // "ISTANBUL" (English rules)
print(turkishWord.uppercased(with: Locale(identifier: "tr"))) // "İSTANBUL" (Turkish rules)
```

## Summary

Swift provides sophisticated Unicode support through its `String` and `Character` types:

- Characters are represented as extended grapheme clusters
- Strings provide different views: `characters`, `unicodeScalars`, `utf8`, and `utf16`
- String indices are used instead of integer indexes
- Swift handles Unicode canonicalization automatically

This Unicode support makes Swift an excellent language for developing international applications that can properly handle text in any language or writing system.

## Exercises

1. Write a function that counts the number of grapheme clusters, Unicode scalars, UTF-16 code units, and UTF-8 code units in a string.

2. Create a program that detects if a string contains characters from multiple scripts (Latin, Cyrillic, Arabic, etc.).

3. Implement a function that transliterates non-Latin characters to Latin equivalents (e.g., "привет" to "privet").
