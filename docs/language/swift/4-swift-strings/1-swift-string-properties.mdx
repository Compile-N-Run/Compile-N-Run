# Swift String Properties

## Introduction

Strings in Swift are rich with properties that provide useful information and functionality. These properties help you analyze and manipulate text data efficiently. In this tutorial, we'll explore the most commonly used properties of Swift strings, understand how they work, and see how they can be applied in practical programming scenarios.

## Key String Properties in Swift

Swift strings come with several built-in properties that provide valuable information about the string content. Let's explore these properties one by one.

### 1. isEmpty

The `isEmpty` property checks whether a string contains any characters. It returns a Boolean value: `true` if the string is empty and `false` if it contains at least one character.

```swift
let emptyString = ""
let nonEmptyString = "Hello"

print(emptyString.isEmpty) // Output: true
print(nonEmptyString.isEmpty) // Output: false
```

This is particularly useful when validating user input to ensure that required fields aren't left blank.

### 2. count

The `count` property returns the number of characters in a string.

```swift
let greeting = "Hello, World!"
print(greeting.count) // Output: 13

let emoji = "👨‍👩‍👧‍👦"
print(emoji.count) // Output: 1 (because this family emoji is considered a single character)
```

Notice that Swift handles Unicode characters intelligently, counting grapheme clusters (what humans perceive as single characters) rather than individual code points.

### 3. startIndex and endIndex

Swift strings provide `startIndex` and `endIndex` properties that represent the positions of the first character and the position after the last character, respectively.

```swift
let message = "Swift Strings"
let firstIndex = message.startIndex
let lastIndex = message.index(before: message.endIndex)

print(message[firstIndex]) // Output: S
print(message[lastIndex]) // Output: s
```

Note that you cannot directly access `message[endIndex]` as it points to the position after the last character.

### 4. first and last

For convenience, Swift strings provide `first` and `last` properties which give you the first and last characters of the string as optional values.

```swift
let language = "Swift"

if let firstChar = language.first {
    print("First character: \(firstChar)") // Output: First character: S
}

if let lastChar = language.last {
    print("Last character: \(lastChar)") // Output: Last character: t
}

let emptyStr = ""
print(emptyStr.first) // Output: nil
```

These properties return `nil` if the string is empty, which is why they're optional and often used with conditional unwrapping.

### 5. lowercased() and uppercased()

While technically methods rather than properties, these are commonly used with strings to create lowercase or uppercase versions of the original string.

```swift
let mixedCase = "SwIfT ProGrAMminG"
let lowercase = mixedCase.lowercased()
let uppercase = mixedCase.uppercased()

print(lowercase) // Output: swift programming
print(uppercase) // Output: SWIFT PROGRAMMING
```

These methods don't modify the original string but return a new string with the appropriate case transformation.

### 6. hasPrefix and hasSuffix

These methods check if a string begins or ends with a particular substring.

```swift
let filename = "document.pdf"

if filename.hasPrefix("doc") {
    print("Filename starts with 'doc'") // This will be printed
}

if filename.hasSuffix(".pdf") {
    print("This is a PDF file") // This will be printed
}
```

These are particularly useful when working with file names, URLs, or any text with standardized formats.

## Practical Applications

Let's look at some practical examples where string properties are valuable:

### Example 1: Form Validation

```swift
func validateUsername(_ username: String) -> Bool {
    // Username must not be empty and have at least 3 characters
    if username.isEmpty {
        print("Username cannot be empty")
        return false
    }
    
    if username.count < 3 {
        print("Username must have at least 3 characters")
        return false
    }
    
    return true
}

validateUsername("") // Output: Username cannot be empty
validateUsername("ab") // Output: Username must have at least 3 characters
validateUsername("user123") // Returns: true
```

### Example 2: File Management

```swift
func processFile(_ filename: String) {
    if filename.isEmpty {
        print("Filename cannot be empty")
        return
    }
    
    if filename.hasSuffix(".txt") {
        print("Processing text file: \(filename)")
    } else if filename.hasSuffix(".jpg") || filename.hasSuffix(".png") {
        print("Processing image file: \(filename)")
    } else {
        print("Unsupported file format")
    }
}

processFile("document.txt") // Output: Processing text file: document.txt
processFile("photo.jpg") // Output: Processing image file: photo.jpg
processFile("data.csv") // Output: Unsupported file format
```

### Example 3: Text Analysis

```swift
func analyzeText(_ text: String) {
    if text.isEmpty {
        print("No text to analyze")
        return
    }
    
    let wordCount = text.split(separator: " ").count
    let letterCount = text.filter { $0.isLetter }.count
    let uppercaseCount = text.filter { $0.isUppercase }.count
    
    print("Word count: \(wordCount)")
    print("Letter count: \(letterCount)")
    print("Uppercase letters: \(uppercaseCount)")
}

analyzeText("Swift Programming Language is Amazing!")
/* Output:
Word count: 5
Letter count: 32
Uppercase letters: 5
*/
```

## Summary

Swift string properties provide powerful tools for analyzing and manipulating text in your applications. We've explored key properties including:

- `isEmpty`: Determines if a string contains any characters
- `count`: Returns the number of characters in a string
- `startIndex` and `endIndex`: Represent the positions of the first character and after the last character
- `first` and `last`: Give access to the first and last characters
- `lowercased()` and `uppercased()`: Convert string case
- `hasPrefix` and `hasSuffix`: Check beginning and ending of strings

Understanding these properties enables you to work effectively with text data in your Swift applications, from basic string validation to complex text analysis.

## Practice Exercises

To reinforce your understanding of Swift string properties:

1. Write a function that checks if a password is strong enough (not empty, at least 8 characters, contains at least one uppercase letter)
2. Create a function that extracts the file extension from a given filename
3. Write a program that counts the number of vowels in a string
4. Implement a function that checks if a string is a palindrome (reads the same backward as forward)
