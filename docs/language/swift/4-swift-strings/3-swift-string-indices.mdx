# Swift String Indices

## Introduction

One of the most surprising aspects of Swift for beginners is how string indices work. Unlike many other programming languages where you can access characters using integer subscripts, Swift uses a specialized index system for strings. This approach might seem complex at first, but it has significant advantages for handling international characters and emoji correctly.

In this tutorial, we'll explore how string indices work in Swift, why Swift designed strings this way, and how to manipulate strings efficiently using indices.

## Why Swift Doesn't Use Integer Indices

In many programming languages, you can access the third character of a string like this:

```
let name = "Swift"
let thirdCharacter = name[2]  // Works in other languages, but NOT in Swift
```

However, Swift doesn't allow this approach. The reason lies in how Swift handles Unicode characters. Since Swift strings are fully Unicode-compliant, each character can occupy a variable amount of memory. Some characters might require multiple bytes to represent, meaning that simple integer indexing wouldn't reliably point to character boundaries.

## Understanding String.Index

Instead of integers, Swift uses the `String.Index` type for string indexing. Here's how you can access characters:

```swift
let greeting = "Hello, Swift!"

// Getting the starting index
let startIndex = greeting.startIndex
print(greeting[startIndex]) // Output: H

// Getting the ending index (Note: endIndex points AFTER the last character)
let endIndex = greeting.endIndex
// print(greeting[endIndex]) // This would crash!

// Getting the index before the end
let lastCharacterIndex = greeting.index(before: endIndex)
print(greeting[lastCharacterIndex]) // Output: !
```

## Basic String Index Operations

Swift provides several methods to navigate string indices:

### 1. Getting the First and Last Character

```swift
let language = "Swift"

// First character
let firstIndex = language.startIndex
let firstCharacter = language[firstIndex]
print(firstCharacter) // Output: S

// Last character
let lastIndex = language.index(before: language.endIndex)
let lastCharacter = language[lastIndex]
print(lastCharacter) // Output: t
```

### 2. Moving Indices Forward and Backward

Swift provides methods to move indices:

```swift
let message = "Hello"

// Moving forward
let secondIndex = message.index(after: message.startIndex)
print(message[secondIndex]) // Output: e

// Moving forward by a specific offset
let thirdIndex = message.index(message.startIndex, offsetBy: 2)
print(message[thirdIndex]) // Output: l

// Moving backward
let fourthIndex = message.index(before: message.endIndex)
print(message[fourthIndex]) // Output: o
```

### 3. Safe Offset with Limiting

When using offset, you can exceed the string's bounds. To prevent crashes, use the `limitedBy` parameter:

```swift
let word = "Swift"

// Attempting to move beyond the string's length
if let farIndex = word.index(word.startIndex, offsetBy: 10, limitedBy: word.endIndex) {
    print(word[farIndex])
} else {
    print("Index out of bounds")
} // Output: "Index out of bounds"

// Safe offset within bounds
if let thirdIndex = word.index(word.startIndex, offsetBy: 2, limitedBy: word.endIndex) {
    print(word[thirdIndex]) // Output: i
}
```

## Working with Ranges of Indices

Swift allows working with ranges of string indices to get substrings:

### 1. Getting a Substring Using Range

```swift
let fullName = "John Smith"

let firstNameEndIndex = fullName.firstIndex(of: " ")!
let firstName = fullName[fullName.startIndex..<firstNameEndIndex]
print(firstName) // Output: John

// Getting the last name
let lastNameStartIndex = fullName.index(after: firstNameEndIndex)
let lastName = fullName[lastNameStartIndex..<fullName.endIndex]
print(lastName) // Output: Smith
```

### 2. Using Range Expressions

```swift
let sentence = "Swift programming is fun!"

// Get the first 5 characters
let startIndex = sentence.startIndex
let fifthIndex = sentence.index(startIndex, offsetBy: 5)
let firstFiveChars = sentence[startIndex..<fifthIndex]
print(firstFiveChars) // Output: Swift

// Get the last 4 characters
let endIndex = sentence.endIndex
let startOfLastFour = sentence.index(endIndex, offsetBy: -4)
let lastFourChars = sentence[startOfLastFour..<endIndex]
print(lastFourChars) // Output: fun!
```

## Practical Examples

Let's go through some real-world examples of working with string indices in Swift:

### Example 1: Truncating Text with an Ellipsis

```swift
func truncateText(_ text: String, maxLength: Int) -> String {
    guard text.count > maxLength else { return text }
    
    let endIndex = text.index(text.startIndex, offsetBy: maxLength, limitedBy: text.endIndex) ?? text.endIndex
    let truncated = text[..<endIndex]
    return String(truncated) + "..."
}

let longText = "This is a very long text that needs to be truncated."
let truncated = truncateText(longText, maxLength: 20)
print(truncated) // Output: This is a very long...
```

### Example 2: Finding and Highlighting a Substring

```swift
func highlightKeyword(_ text: String, keyword: String) -> String {
    guard let keywordRange = text.range(of: keyword, options: .caseInsensitive) else {
        return text  // Keyword not found
    }
    
    let before = text[..<keywordRange.lowerBound]
    let after = text[keywordRange.upperBound...]
    
    return String(before) + "**\(text[keywordRange])**" + String(after)
}

let sentence = "Swift is a powerful programming language"
let highlighted = highlightKeyword(sentence, keyword: "powerful")
print(highlighted) // Output: Swift is a **powerful** programming language
```

### Example 3: Validating Email Format

```swift
func isValidEmail(_ email: String) -> Bool {
    // Check if the email contains exactly one "@" symbol
    guard let atSymbolIndex = email.firstIndex(of: "@") else {
        return false
    }
    
    // Check if there's text before the "@" symbol
    guard atSymbolIndex > email.startIndex else {
        return false
    }
    
    // Check if there's a period after the "@" symbol
    let domainStartIndex = email.index(after: atSymbolIndex)
    guard let periodIndex = email[domainStartIndex...].firstIndex(of: "."),
          periodIndex < email.endIndex,
          email.distance(from: domainStartIndex, to: periodIndex) > 0,
          email.distance(from: periodIndex, to: email.endIndex) > 1 else {
        return false
    }
    
    return true
}

print(isValidEmail("user@example.com"))  // Output: true
print(isValidEmail("invalid@email"))     // Output: false
print(isValidEmail("@missing.com"))      // Output: false
```

## The Complexity of Unicode and Swift's Approach

To better understand why Swift uses complex string indices, let's look at Unicode examples:

```swift
let flags = "üá∫üá∏üá¨üáßüáØüáµ"
print(flags.count)  // Output: 3 (not 6, even though there are 6 Unicode scalars)

let family = "üë®‚Äçüë©‚Äçüë¶"
print(family.count)  // Output: 1 (though this is composed of multiple Unicode code points)
```

Swift counts *extended grapheme clusters* ‚Äî what humans perceive as single characters ‚Äî rather than Unicode code points. This is why direct integer indexing would be misleading.

## Working with Characters Collection

For some operations, it's simpler to convert a string to an array of characters:

```swift
let greeting = "Hello"
let characters = Array(greeting)
print(characters[1])  // Output: e

// However, be cautious with this approach for large strings or strings with complex characters
let complexString = "üá∫üá∏Hello SwiftüöÄ"
let complexChars = Array(complexString)
print(complexChars.count)  // Output reflects actual perceived character count
```

## Best Practices for String Indices

1. **Cache indices** when performing multiple operations at the same position
2. **Use string methods** like `prefix`, `suffix`, `hasPrefix`, and `hasSuffix` when possible
3. **Consider array conversion** for simple cases but be mindful of performance for large strings
4. **Use the `limitedBy` parameter** to prevent crashes from out-of-bounds indices

## Summary

Working with string indices in Swift might seem complex at first, but it provides a robust approach for handling Unicode characters correctly. The key points to remember:

- Swift strings use `String.Index` instead of integers
- Use methods like `startIndex`, `endIndex`, and `index(before:)` to navigate strings
- When getting a range of characters, use ranges of indices
- For simple cases with known ASCII strings, consider converting to an array of characters
- Always be cautious of string bounds when calculating indices

By mastering string indices, you'll be well-equipped to handle text processing in Swift correctly across all languages and character sets.

## Exercises

1. Write a function that reverses a string using string indices (not the built-in `reversed()` method).
2. Create a function that capitalizes the first letter of each word in a sentence.
3. Implement a function that extracts all hashtags (words starting with #) from a social media post.
4. Write a function that checks if a string is a palindrome using string indices.
5. Create a utility function that safely retrieves a character at a given position (using integer input but converting to string indices internally).
