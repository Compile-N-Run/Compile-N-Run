# Swift String Manipulation

## Introduction

String manipulation is a fundamental skill in programming that involves modifying, combining, or extracting parts of text data. In Swift, the String type offers a rich set of functionalities for text manipulation that makes working with textual data straightforward yet powerful.

In this tutorial, you'll learn various techniques to manipulate strings in Swift, from basic operations like concatenation and character access to more complex operations like substring extraction and transformations.

## Basic String Operations

### String Concatenation

One of the most common string operations is combining two or more strings together. Swift offers multiple ways to accomplish this.

#### Using the + Operator

```swift
let firstName = "John"
let lastName = "Doe"
let fullName = firstName + " " + lastName

print(fullName) // Output: John Doe
```

#### Using String Interpolation

String interpolation is a more readable approach when combining strings with variables:

```swift
let firstName = "Jane"
let lastName = "Smith"
let fullName = "\(firstName) \(lastName)"

print(fullName) // Output: Jane Smith
```

#### Using the append() Method

For mutable strings, you can use the `append()` method:

```swift
var greeting = "Hello"
greeting.append(", World!")

print(greeting) // Output: Hello, World!
```

### Accessing Characters in a String

Swift treats strings as collections of characters, allowing for direct access.

```swift
let message = "Swift"

// Access the first character
let firstChar = message[message.startIndex]
print(firstChar) // Output: S

// Access the last character
let lastIndex = message.index(before: message.endIndex)
let lastChar = message[lastIndex]
print(lastChar) // Output: t
```

For accessing characters at specific positions, you need to use string indices:

```swift
let message = "Hello"
let index = message.index(message.startIndex, offsetBy: 2)
let thirdChar = message[index]

print(thirdChar) // Output: l
```

## Working with Substrings

### Extracting Substrings

Swift provides various ways to extract portions of a string:

#### Using Ranges

```swift
let greeting = "Hello, World!"
let index = greeting.firstIndex(of: ",") ?? greeting.endIndex
let firstPart = greeting[..<index]

print(firstPart) // Output: Hello
```

#### Using prefix() and suffix()

```swift
let message = "Swift Programming"
let firstFive = message.prefix(5)
let lastFour = message.suffix(4)

print(firstFive) // Output: Swift
print(lastFour)  // Output: ming
```

### Important Note About Substrings

In Swift, when you extract a substring, the result is of type `Substring`, not `String`. A `Substring` shares memory with its original String, which makes it efficient but temporary:

```swift
let original = "Swift Programming"
let substring = original.prefix(5) // Type is Substring

// Convert back to String when storing for longer use
let newString = String(substring)
```

## String Transformations

### Changing Case

Swift makes it easy to transform the case of strings:

```swift
let normalText = "Hello, Swift Programmers!"

let lowercased = normalText.lowercased()
print(lowercased) // Output: hello, swift programmers!

let uppercased = normalText.uppercased()
print(uppercased) // Output: HELLO, SWIFT PROGRAMMERS!

let capitalized = normalText.capitalized
print(capitalized) // Output: Hello, Swift Programmers!
```

### Replacing Content

You can replace parts of a string with other content:

```swift
let oldMessage = "Swift is difficult"
let newMessage = oldMessage.replacingOccurrences(of: "difficult", with: "awesome")

print(newMessage) // Output: Swift is awesome
```

### Trimming Whitespace

To remove unwanted whitespace from the beginning and end of strings:

```swift
let paddedText = "   Too much space   "
let trimmed = paddedText.trimmingCharacters(in: .whitespaces)

print("'\(trimmed)'") // Output: 'Too much space'
```

## Searching Within Strings

### Checking if a String Contains Another String

```swift
let sentence = "Swift is a powerful programming language"

// Check if contains a substring
let containsSwift = sentence.contains("Swift")
print(containsSwift) // Output: true

// Check if starts with a prefix
let startsWithSwift = sentence.hasPrefix("Swift")
print(startsWithSwift) // Output: true

// Check if ends with a suffix
let endsWithLanguage = sentence.hasSuffix("language")
print(endsWithLanguage) // Output: true
```

### Finding the Position of a Substring

```swift
let text = "Finding needle in haystack"

if let range = text.range(of: "needle") {
    let position = text.distance(from: text.startIndex, to: range.lowerBound)
    print("Found 'needle' at position \(position)") // Output: Found 'needle' at position 8
}
```

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: Building a Username Validator

This example shows how to validate a username by checking its length and allowed characters:

```swift
func isValidUsername(_ username: String) -> Bool {
    // Check if length is between 3 and 15 characters
    guard username.count >= 3 && username.count <= 15 else {
        return false
    }
    
    // Check if contains only letters, numbers, and underscores
    let allowedCharacters = CharacterSet(charactersIn: "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789_")
    return username.unicodeScalars.allSatisfy { allowedCharacters.contains($0) }
}

// Test the function
let username1 = "john_doe42"
let username2 = "user@name"
let username3 = "a"

print(isValidUsername(username1)) // Output: true
print(isValidUsername(username2)) // Output: false (contains @)
print(isValidUsername(username3)) // Output: false (too short)
```

### Example 2: Formatting a Phone Number

This example shows how to format a plain string of digits into a standard phone number format:

```swift
func formatPhoneNumber(_ phoneNumber: String) -> String {
    // Remove any non-digit character
    let digits = phoneNumber.filter { $0.isNumber }
    
    // Check if we have the expected number of digits
    guard digits.count == 10 else {
        return "Invalid phone number"
    }
    
    // Convert to array for easier manipulation
    let characters = Array(digits)
    
    // Format as (XXX) XXX-XXXX
    return "(\(characters[0])\(characters[1])\(characters[2])) \(characters[3])\(characters[4])\(characters[5])-\(characters[6])\(characters[7])\(characters[8])\(characters[9])"
}

// Test the function
let rawPhoneNumber = "1234567890"
let formattedPhoneNumber = formatPhoneNumber(rawPhoneNumber)
print(formattedPhoneNumber) // Output: (123) 456-7890
```

### Example 3: Creating a Simple Text Statistics Tool

This example counts words, characters, and sentences in a text:

```swift
func textStatistics(for text: String) -> (wordCount: Int, characterCount: Int, sentenceCount: Int) {
    // Count characters (excluding whitespace)
    let characterCount = text.filter { !$0.isWhitespace }.count
    
    // Count words
    let words = text.components(separatedBy: .whitespacesAndNewlines).filter { !$0.isEmpty }
    let wordCount = words.count
    
    // Count sentences (simple approximation based on periods)
    let sentenceCount = text.components(separatedBy: ".").filter { !$0.isEmpty }.count
    
    return (wordCount, characterCount, sentenceCount)
}

// Test the function
let sampleText = "Swift is amazing. It makes iOS development fun. Let's learn more about it!"
let stats = textStatistics(for: sampleText)

print("Word count: \(stats.wordCount)")           // Output: Word count: 14
print("Character count: \(stats.characterCount)") // Output: Character count: 59
print("Sentence count: \(stats.sentenceCount)")   // Output: Sentence count: 3
```
