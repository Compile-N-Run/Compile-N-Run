# Swift Type Methods

## Introduction

In Swift, methods are functions that are associated with a particular type. Most of the methods we write are **instance methods**, which operate on a specific instance of a type. However, Swift also allows you to define methods that are called on the type itself, not on an instance. These are known as **type methods**.

Type methods are similar to static methods in other programming languages. They're useful when functionality is relevant to the type as a whole rather than to specific instances of the type.

## Understanding Type Methods

### What Are Type Methods?

Type methods belong to the type itself rather than to instances of that type. This means:

- You call them on the type, not on an instance
- They cannot access instance properties directly
- They can access other type properties and type methods

### Declaring Type Methods

In Swift, you declare type methods using the `static` or `class` keyword:

- Use `static` for structures, enumerations, and classes (when you don't want subclasses to override)
- Use `class` only in classes when you want to allow subclasses to override the method

## Implementing Type Methods in Structures

Let's see how to implement type methods in a Swift structure:

```swift
struct MathHelper {
    // Type property
    static let pi = 3.14159

    // Type method
    static func calculateCircleArea(radius: Double) -> Double {
        return pi * radius * radius
    }
    
    // Instance method (for comparison)
    func double(value: Double) -> Double {
        return value * 2
    }
}

// Using the type method
let area = MathHelper.calculateCircleArea(radius: 5)
print("The area of the circle is \(area)")

// Using an instance method
let helper = MathHelper()
let doubled = helper.double(value: 10)
print("Doubled value is \(doubled)")
```

Output:
```
The area of the circle is 78.53975
Doubled value is 20
```

Note that we called the type method directly on the `MathHelper` type, without creating an instance.

## Type Methods in Classes

In classes, you can use either `static` or `class` for type methods:

```swift
class Vehicle {
    // Type property
    static var totalVehiclesCreated = 0
    
    // Instance property
    var name: String
    
    init(name: String) {
        self.name = name
        Vehicle.totalVehiclesCreated += 1
    }
    
    // Type method with 'static' - cannot be overridden
    static func resetTotalCount() {
        totalVehiclesCreated = 0
    }
    
    // Type method with 'class' - can be overridden by subclasses
    class func describe() -> String {
        return "This is a vehicle type"
    }
}

class Car: Vehicle {
    // Override the class type method
    override class func describe() -> String {
        return "This is a car type, which is a kind of vehicle"
    }
    
    // Cannot override static methods
    // override static func resetTotalCount() { } // This would cause an error!
}

// Create some vehicles
let bike = Vehicle(name: "Mountain Bike")
let sedan = Car(name: "Sedan")

print("Total vehicles created: \(Vehicle.totalVehiclesCreated)")
print(Vehicle.describe())
print(Car.describe())

// Reset the count
Vehicle.resetTotalCount()
print("After reset: \(Vehicle.totalVehiclesCreated)")
```

Output:
```
Total vehicles created: 2
This is a vehicle type
This is a car type, which is a kind of vehicle
After reset: 0
```

## Practical Uses of Type Methods

### 1. Factory Methods

Type methods are great for creating factory methods that return new instances:

```swift
struct Point {
    var x: Double
    var y: Double
    
    // Factory method to create a point at the origin
    static func origin() -> Point {
        return Point(x: 0, y: 0)
    }
    
    // Factory method to create a unit point
    static func unit() -> Point {
        return Point(x: 1, y: 1)
    }
}

let origin = Point.origin()
print("Origin point: (\(origin.x), \(origin.y))")

let unit = Point.unit()
print("Unit point: (\(unit.x), \(unit.y))")
```

Output:
```
Origin point: (0.0, 0.0)
Unit point: (1.0, 1.0)
```

### 2. Utility Functions

Type methods are perfect for organizing utility functions:

```swift
struct StringUtils {
    static func isValidEmail(_ email: String) -> Bool {
        // Simplified email validation
        return email.contains("@") && email.contains(".")
    }
    
    static func capitalize(_ string: String) -> String {
        return string.prefix(1).uppercased() + string.dropFirst()
    }
}

let email = "user@example.com"
print("\(email) is valid email: \(StringUtils.isValidEmail(email))")

let name = "swift"
print("Capitalized: \(StringUtils.capitalize(name))")
```

Output:
```
user@example.com is valid email: true
Capitalized: Swift
```

### 3. Shared Resources and Configuration

Type methods help manage shared resources and configuration settings:

```swift
struct AppConfig {
    // Private storage
    private static var settings: [String: Any] = ["theme": "light", "fontSize": 12]
    
    // Get a setting
    static func getSetting<T>(key: String, defaultValue: T) -> T {
        return (settings[key] as? T) ?? defaultValue
    }
    
    // Update a setting
    static func updateSetting(key: String, value: Any) {
        settings[key] = value
    }
    
    // Print all settings
    static func printAllSettings() {
        print("Current settings:")
        for (key, value) in settings {
            print("- \(key): \(value)")
        }
    }
}

// Get current settings
let theme = AppConfig.getSetting(key: "theme", defaultValue: "dark")
print("Current theme: \(theme)")

// Update a setting
AppConfig.updateSetting(key: "theme", value: "dark")
AppConfig.updateSetting(key: "fontSize", value: 14)

// Print all settings
AppConfig.printAllSettings()
```

Output:
```
Current theme: light
Current settings:
- fontSize: 14
- theme: dark
```

## When to Use Type Methods

Type methods are most appropriate when:

1. The functionality is related to the type as a whole, not to specific instances
2. You need to share functionality across all instances
3. You need to access or modify type properties
4. You want to provide utility functions related to a type
5. You're implementing the factory pattern or similar design patterns

## Type Methods vs. Instance Methods

| Type Methods | Instance Methods |
|--------------|------------------|
| Called on the type itself | Called on an instance |
| Use `static` or `class` keyword | No special keyword |
| Cannot access instance properties directly | Can access instance properties |
| Can access type properties | Can access type properties using type name |
| Useful for utility functions and factory methods | Useful for instance-specific behavior |

## Summary

Type methods in Swift provide a powerful way to associate functionality with a type rather than with instances of that type. Using the `static` or `class` keyword, you can define methods that are called directly on the type itself. Type methods are particularly useful for factory methods, utility functions, and managing shared resources.

Key points to remember:
- Use the `static` keyword for type methods in structures, enumerations, and classes
- Use the `class` keyword in classes when you want to allow method overriding in subclasses
- Type methods can access type properties but not instance properties
- Type methods are called on the type itself, not on instances

## Exercises

1. Create a `Calculator` structure with type methods for basic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

2. Implement a `DateFormatter` structure with type methods to convert dates to different string formats.

3. Create a `UserManager` class with type methods to handle user authentication, including login and logout functionality.

4. Implement a `FileHelper` structure with type methods for common file operations like reading, writing, and checking if a file exists.
