# Swift Do Try Catch

Error handling is a critical aspect of building robust applications. Swift provides an elegant mechanism to handle errors through its `do-try-catch` syntax, allowing you to gracefully manage unexpected situations in your code. This guide will walk you through Swift's error handling pattern, from basic concepts to practical implementations.

## Introduction to Error Handling in Swift

In Swift, error handling is the process of responding to and recovering from error conditions in your program. Swift's error handling works on the principle of throwing, propagating, and handling errors that occur during execution.

The core components of Swift's error handling system are:

1. **Error Protocol**: A type that represents an error
2. **Throwing functions**: Functions that can potentially produce an error
3. **do-try-catch**: The syntax for handling possible errors

## The Error Protocol

Before diving into `do-try-catch`, it's important to understand how errors are defined in Swift. All errors must conform to the `Error` protocol:

```swift
enum NetworkError: Error {
    case noConnection
    case serverError(Int)
    case invalidData
    case authenticationRequired
}
```

This simple declaration creates a custom error type with several specific error cases, including one that carries an associated value (the server error code).

## The Basics of Do-Try-Catch

The `do-try-catch` pattern in Swift works as follows:

```swift
do {
    try expressionThatMightThrow()
    // Code that executes if no error was thrown
} catch {
    // Handle error
}
```

Let's break down this pattern:

- **do**: A block that contains one or more statements that might throw an error
- **try**: A keyword that precedes an expression that can throw
- **catch**: A block that handles errors thrown in the do block

## A Simple Example

Let's see a basic example of error handling:

```swift
enum MathError: Error {
    case divisionByZero
}

func divide(_ a: Int, by b: Int) throws -> Int {
    guard b != 0 else {
        throw MathError.divisionByZero
    }
    return a / b
}

// Using the function with do-try-catch
do {
    let result = try divide(10, by: 2)
    print("Result: \(result)") // Output: Result: 5
    
    let anotherResult = try divide(10, by: 0)
    print("This will never be reached")
} catch MathError.divisionByZero {
    print("Error: Cannot divide by zero!") // This will be printed for the second calculation
}
```

In this example:
1. We define a `MathError` enum that conforms to `Error`
2. Our `divide()` function is marked with `throws` to indicate it can throw an error
3. Inside the function, we throw an error if division by zero is attempted
4. In our usage code, we use `do-try-catch` to handle potential errors

## Multiple Catch Blocks

You can have multiple catch blocks to handle different types of errors:

```swift
do {
    let result = try divide(10, by: 0)
    print("Result: \(result)")
} catch MathError.divisionByZero {
    print("Cannot divide by zero!")
} catch {
    // This is a general catch block that catches any other errors
    print("An unexpected error occurred: \(error)")
}
```

The catch blocks are checked in order, and the first matching one is executed. The final catch block without a specific error type acts as a fallback for any other errors.

## Try? and Try! Operators

Swift provides two variants of the `try` keyword for different scenarios:

### try?

The `try?` operator attempts to execute a throwing expression and returns an optional value. If an error is thrown, the result is `nil`.

```swift
let result = try? divide(10, by: 0) // result is nil
let safeResult = try? divide(10, by: 5) // safeResult is Optional(2)

if let safeResult = safeResult {
    print("Division succeeded: \(safeResult)") // Output: Division succeeded: 2
} else {
    print("Division failed")
}
```

This is useful when you want to handle the absence of a value rather than the specific error.

### try!

The `try!` operator attempts to execute a throwing expression and unwraps the result. However, if an error is thrown, your program will crash. Use this only when you are absolutely certain an error cannot occur.

```swift
// Only use when you're 100% sure no error will be thrown
let guaranteedResult = try! divide(10, by: 5) // guaranteedResult is 2
print("Result: \(guaranteedResult)") // Output: Result: 2

// This will crash your program!
// let crashingResult = try! divide(10, by: 0)
```

## Practical Example: File Operations

Let's look at a real-world example involving file operations, which often require error handling:

```swift
enum FileError: Error {
    case fileNotFound
    case readError
    case writeError
}

func readFile(at path: String) throws -> String {
    // Simulating file reading with potential errors
    guard FileManager.default.fileExists(atPath: path) else {
        throw FileError.fileNotFound
    }
    
    do {
        return try String(contentsOfFile: path, encoding: .utf8)
    } catch {
        throw FileError.readError
    }
}

func processFile() {
    let filePath = "/path/to/file.txt"
    
    do {
        let content = try readFile(at: filePath)
        print("File content: \(content)")
    } catch FileError.fileNotFound {
        print("Error: The file was not found at the specified path.")
    } catch FileError.readError {
        print("Error: The file could not be read properly.")
    } catch {
        print("An unexpected error occurred: \(error)")
    }
}

// Call the function
processFile()
```

In this example:
1. We define custom file-related errors
2. The `readFile` function throws specific errors based on what goes wrong
3. The `processFile` function uses `do-try-catch` to handle different error cases

## Error Propagation

Sometimes, instead of handling an error immediately, you want to let the calling function handle it. This is called error propagation:

```swift
func processUserData() throws {
    let userData = try fetchUserData()
    try validateUserData(userData)
    try saveUserData(userData)
}

func handleUserOperation() {
    do {
        try processUserData()
        print("User data processed successfully")
    } catch {
        print("Failed to process user data: \(error)")
    }
}
```

In this pattern:
1. `processUserData()` propagates any errors from its internal functions
2. The responsibility of handling those errors falls to `handleUserOperation()`

## Converting Errors to Optional Results

A common pattern in Swift is to convert a throwing operation into an optional result:

```swift
func fetchData(from url: URL) -> Data? {
    do {
        return try Data(contentsOf: url)
    } catch {
        print("Error fetching data: \(error)")
        return nil
    }
}

// Usage
if let data = fetchData(from: URL(string: "https://example.com")!) {
    // Process data
} else {
    // Handle the absence of data
}
```

This pattern is so common that Swift provides a shorthand with `try?`:

```swift
let data = try? Data(contentsOf: URL(string: "https://example.com")!)
```

## Cleanup Actions with defer

When handling errors, it's often necessary to perform cleanup regardless of whether an error was thrown. The `defer` statement helps with this:

```swift
func processFile(at path: String) throws {
    let file = try FileHandle(forReadingFrom: URL(fileURLWithPath: path))
    
    defer {
        file.closeFile()
        print("File closed")
    }
    
    // Process the file, might throw errors
    let data = try file.readToEnd()
    try processData(data)
}
```

The code in the `defer` block will be executed when the function exits, whether normally or because of an error.

## Best Practices for Error Handling

1. **Be specific with error types**: Create custom error types that provide meaningful information
   
2. **Handle errors at the appropriate level**: Propagate errors up to where they can be meaningfully handled

3. **Provide recovery options**: When possible, offer ways to recover from errors

4. **Use meaningful error messages**: Make debugging easier with clear error descriptions

5. **Avoid using `try!` in production code**: It's safer to properly handle errors than to force unwrap them

## Real-World Example: Network Requests

Here's a comprehensive example of error handling in a network request scenario:

```swift
enum NetworkError: Error {
    case invalidURL
    case noData
    case decodingError
    case serverError(statusCode: Int)
    case noNetwork
}

struct User: Codable {
    let id: Int
    let name: String
    let email: String
}

func fetchUser(id: Int) throws -> User {
    // Create URL
    guard let url = URL(string: "https://api.example.com/users/\(id)") else {
        throw NetworkError.invalidURL
    }
    
    var userData: Data
    var response: URLResponse
    
    // Make synchronous request (just for example purposes - use async in real code)
    do {
        (userData, response) = try Data(contentsOf: url), URLResponse()
    } catch {
        throw NetworkError.noNetwork
    }
    
    // Check response status code
    if let httpResponse = response as? HTTPURLResponse {
        guard (200...299).contains(httpResponse.statusCode) else {
            throw NetworkError.serverError(statusCode: httpResponse.statusCode)
        }
    }
    
    // Decode user data
    do {
        let user = try JSONDecoder().decode(User.self, from: userData)
        return user
    } catch {
        throw NetworkError.decodingError
    }
}

// Using the function
func displayUserProfile(userId: Int) {
    do {
        let user = try fetchUser(id: userId)
        print("User: \(user.name) (\(user.email))")
    } catch NetworkError.invalidURL {
        print("Error: The URL was invalid")
    } catch NetworkError.noNetwork {
        print("Error: Check your internet connection")
    } catch NetworkError.serverError(let statusCode) {
        print("Error: Server returned status code \(statusCode)")
    } catch NetworkError.decodingError {
        print("Error: Couldn't decode user data")
    } catch {
        print("An unexpected error occurred: \(error)")
    }
}

// Call the function
displayUserProfile(userId: 123)
```

This example demonstrates:
1. Detailed error types with associated values
2. Nested error handling
3. Error propagation
4. Specific error handling in the final function

## Summary

The Swift `do-try-catch` mechanism provides a robust way to handle errors in your applications:

- Use the `Error` protocol to define custom error types
- Mark functions that can throw errors with the `throws` keyword
- Use `do-try-catch` blocks to handle errors
- Use `try?` for optional results and `try!` when you're certain no error will occur (use cautiously)
- Propagate errors up the call stack when appropriate
- Use `defer` for cleanup actions

By implementing proper error handling, your Swift applications become more robust, user-friendly, and easier to maintain.
