# Swift String Interpolation

Have you ever needed to include the value of a variable or the result of an expression within a text string? Swift's string interpolation feature makes this easy and elegant. In this tutorial, we'll explore how string interpolation works in Swift and how you can use it to create dynamic text.

## What is String Interpolation?

String interpolation is a way to construct a new string value by including expressions, variables, and constants directly inside a string literal. Instead of manually concatenating strings with the `+` operator, Swift provides a cleaner and more readable syntax using the `\()` syntax.

## Basic String Interpolation

The simplest form of string interpolation involves inserting a variable's value into a string.

```swift
let name = "John"
let greeting = "Hello, \(name)!"
print(greeting) // Output: Hello, John!
```

In this example, the value of the `name` variable is inserted into the string at runtime. The `\(name)` syntax tells Swift to evaluate the expression inside the parentheses and convert the result to a string.

## Interpolating Different Data Types

String interpolation works with any data type, not just strings:

```swift
let age = 25
let message = "You are \(age) years old."
print(message) // Output: You are 25 years old.

let pi = 3.14159
let mathFact = "The value of pi is approximately \(pi)."
print(mathFact) // Output: The value of pi is approximately 3.14159.
```

Swift automatically converts the values to their string representation.

## Using Expressions in String Interpolation

You can include more complex expressions inside the interpolation:

```swift
let a = 5
let b = 10
let result = "The sum of \(a) and \(b) is \(a + b)."
print(result) // Output: The sum of 5 and 10 is 15.

let isRaining = true
let weatherReport = "It is \(isRaining ? "raining" : "not raining") today."
print(weatherReport) // Output: It is raining today.
```

## Formatting Values in String Interpolation

For more control over how values are formatted, you can add formatting expressions:

```swift
let price = 19.99
let formattedPrice = "The product costs $\(String(format: "%.2f", price))."
print(formattedPrice) // Output: The product costs $19.99.

// Formatting a date
import Foundation
let now = Date()
let formatter = DateFormatter()
formatter.dateStyle = .medium
let dateString = "Today's date is \(formatter.string(from: now))."
print(dateString) // Output: Today's date is Jan 1, 2023. (actual date will vary)
```

## Multi-line String Interpolation

String interpolation works with multi-line strings as well:

```swift
let firstName = "Jane"
let lastName = "Doe"
let multiLineGreeting = """
Hello, \(firstName) \(lastName)!
Welcome to Swift programming.
This is a multi-line string with interpolation.
You are learning about string interpolation in Swift \(5).
"""
print(multiLineGreeting)
```

Output:
```
Hello, Jane Doe!
Welcome to Swift programming.
This is a multi-line string with interpolation.
You are learning about string interpolation in Swift 5.
```

## Advanced String Interpolation (Swift 5+)

Starting with Swift 5, string interpolation became more powerful with custom string interpolations:

```swift
// Define an extension on String.StringInterpolation
extension String.StringInterpolation {
    mutating func appendInterpolation(repeat str: String, count: Int) {
        for _ in 0..<count {
            appendLiteral(str)
        }
    }
}

// Using the custom interpolation
let starPattern = "Stars: \(repeat: "⭐️", count: 5)"
print(starPattern) // Output: Stars: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
```

## Practical Applications

### Creating User Messages

```swift
let username = "swift_learner"
let itemCount = 3
let notificationMessage = "Hi \(username), you have \(itemCount) new notification\(itemCount == 1 ? "" : "s")."
print(notificationMessage) // Output: Hi swift_learner, you have 3 new notifications.
```

### Generating URLs

```swift
let baseURL = "https://api.example.com"
let endpoint = "users"
let userID = 42
let apiURL = "\(baseURL)/\(endpoint)/\(userID)"
print(apiURL) // Output: https://api.example.com/users/42
```

### Creating Formatted Data Outputs

```swift
struct Person {
    let name: String
    let age: Int
}

let person = Person(name: "Alice", age: 30)
let personInfo = "Person: { name: \(person.name), age: \(person.age) }"
print(personInfo) // Output: Person: { name: Alice, age: 30 }
```

### Debug Information

```swift
let x = 10
let y = 20
print("Debugging: x = \(x), y = \(y), x+y = \(x+y)")
// Output: Debugging: x = 10, y = 20, x+y = 30
```

## Performance Considerations

While string interpolation is convenient, be aware that it creates a new string each time it's evaluated. For performance-critical code with many string operations, consider using `StringBuilder` or similar optimized approaches.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Nested interpolations** - While possible, deeply nested interpolations can become hard to read:
   ```swift
   // Hard to read
   let message = "Result: \("The value is \(x + y)")"
   
   // Better
   let innerValue = "The value is \(x + y)"
   let message = "Result: \(innerValue)"
   ```

2. **Forgetting to escape backslashes** - If you need a literal `\` character before a parenthesis:
   ```swift
   let path = "C:\\Program Files\\App"  // Use double backslash to represent one backslash
   ```

## Summary

String interpolation in Swift is a powerful feature that lets you:

- Insert variable values into string literals with `\()`
- Include expressions and calculations directly in strings
- Format values with precision control
- Extend string interpolation with custom behaviors (in Swift 5+)

This feature makes your code more readable and maintainable compared to manual string concatenation, especially when working with multiple values or complex string formatting requirements.

## Exercises

1. Create a string that includes your name, age, and favorite programming language using string interpolation.
2. Write a function that takes two numbers and returns a string describing their sum, product, difference, and quotient using string interpolation.
3. Create a custom string interpolation handler that formats numbers as currency with the appropriate symbol (like $ or €).
4. Use string interpolation to create a dynamic SQL query with parameters (but remember, in real code, always use parameterized queries for security).
