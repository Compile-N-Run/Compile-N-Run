# Swift Type Inference

## Introduction

Type inference is one of Swift's most powerful features that makes the language both safe and expressive. At its core, type inference is the ability of the Swift compiler to automatically deduce the type of a variable or expression based on the value you provide, without requiring explicit type annotations.

This feature allows you to write concise, readable code while maintaining Swift's type-safety guarantees. In this lesson, we'll explore how type inference works in Swift, when to rely on it, and when explicit type annotations might be preferable.

## Understanding Type Inference

In many programming languages, you need to explicitly declare the type of every variable. For example, in a language like C or Java, you might write:

```java
int age = 30;
String name = "John";
```

Swift can work this way too with explicit type annotations:

```swift
let age: Int = 30
let name: String = "John"
```

However, Swift's type inference allows you to omit these type annotations in many cases:

```swift
let age = 30       // Swift infers that age is an Int
let name = "John"  // Swift infers that name is a String
```

The Swift compiler examines the initial value you assign and automatically determines the appropriate type. This makes your code cleaner and more concise while still maintaining all the benefits of strong typing.

## How Type Inference Works

Let's look deeper at how Swift determines types:

### Basic Type Inference

```swift
let score = 100             // Inferred as Int
let pi = 3.14               // Inferred as Double
let message = "Hello"       // Inferred as String
let isComplete = false      // Inferred as Bool
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]  // Inferred as [Int] (Array of Integers)
```

In each case, Swift looks at the literal value and determines the most appropriate type.

### Type Inference with Expressions

Swift can also infer types from expressions:

```swift
let a = 10
let b = 20
let sum = a + b    // Inferred as Int because a and b are Ints

let firstName = "John"
let lastName = "Doe"
let fullName = firstName + " " + lastName  // Inferred as String
```

### Numeric Type Inference

Swift has default behaviors when inferring numeric types:

```swift
let integer = 42        // Inferred as Int
let float = 42.0        // Inferred as Double, not Float
let decimal = 3.14159   // Inferred as Double
```

It's important to note that Swift always infers floating-point literals as `Double` rather than `Float` by default.

## Type Inference with Collections

Swift applies type inference to collections as well:

```swift
// Array type inference
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]           // Inferred as [Int]
let names = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"] // Inferred as [String]

// Dictionary type inference
let scores = ["Alice": 94, "Bob": 85, "Charlie": 90]  // Inferred as [String: Int]

// Mixed types
let mixed = [1, 2, 3.14, 5]  // Inferred as [Double] - all elements converted to a common type
```

## When Type Inference Needs Help

There are situations where Swift cannot infer the type on its own, and you'll need to provide explicit type annotations:

### Empty Collections

When creating empty collections, Swift needs to know what type to expect:

```swift
// Without type annotation, this would cause an error
let emptyArray: [String] = []
let emptyDictionary: [String: Int] = [:]

// Alternative syntax
let emptyArray2 = [String]()
let emptyDictionary2 = [String: Int]()
```

### Function Return Types with Empty Returns

For functions with empty returns or complex logic, explicit return types help:

```swift
// Good practice to include the return type
func fetchUserScore() -> Int {
    // Complex logic
    return 100
}

// Required for empty returns
func calculateSum(numbers: [Int]) -> Int {
    guard !numbers.isEmpty else {
        return 0  // Without the return type annotation, Swift couldn't infer this
    }
    
    var sum = 0
    for number in numbers {
        sum += number
    }
    return sum
}
```

## Practical Examples

Let's look at some real-world examples of type inference in action.

### Example 1: Building a User Profile

```swift
// Type inference with a more complex structure
func createUserProfile() {
    let id = 12345                     // Inferred as Int
    let name = "Jane Smith"            // Inferred as String
    let isActive = true                // Inferred as Bool
    let joinDate = Date()              // Inferred as Date
    let preferences = [                // Inferred as [String: Any]
        "darkMode": true,
        "fontSize": 14,
        "language": "English"
    ]
    
    // Using the inferred types
    print("User \(name) (ID: \(id)) joined on \(joinDate)")
    print("Dark mode enabled: \(preferences["darkMode"] as? Bool ?? false)")
}
```

### Example 2: Working with Network Data

```swift
// Simulating parsing JSON data
func parseUserData() {
    // Simulated JSON response converted to Swift types
    let userData = [
        "id": 501,
        "name": "Alex Johnson",
        "email": "alex@example.com",
        "isVerified": true,
        "scores": [85, 90, 78]
    ]
    
    // Swift infers the types when we extract values
    let id = userData["id"] as? Int
    let name = userData["name"] as? String
    let scores = userData["scores"] as? [Int]
    
    if let userName = name, let userScores = scores {
        let averageScore = userScores.reduce(0, +) / userScores.count
        print("\(userName)'s average score is \(averageScore)")
    }
}
```

## When to Use Explicit Type Annotations

While type inference is convenient, there are times when explicitly stating types improves code clarity and intent:

1. **For API clarity**: When defining public interfaces
   ```swift
   public func fetchWeatherData() -> [WeatherRecord] {
       // Implementation
       return records
   }
   ```

2. **To be explicit about numeric types**:
   ```swift
   let distance: Float = 56.7  // Explicitly using Float instead of the default Double
   let smallNumber: Int8 = 127 // Using a specific integer size
   ```

3. **When initializing empty variables**:
   ```swift
   var userComments: [String] = []
   var tempCache: [Int: String] = [:]
   ```

4. **To ensure specific subclasses or protocol conformances**:
   ```swift
   let shape: Shape = Circle(radius: 10)  // Explicitly storing as the base type
   ```

## Summary

Swift's type inference is a powerful feature that allows you to write cleaner, more concise code without sacrificing type safety. The compiler intelligently determines the types of your variables and expressions based on their values and context.

Key points to remember:
- Type inference reduces verbosity while maintaining Swift's strong typing system
- Swift infers types for variables, constants, collections, and function returns
- Numeric literals are inferred as `Int` and `Double` by default
- Explicit type annotations are needed for empty collections and sometimes for clarity
- Use type annotations when you want to be explicit about your intentions

By understanding when to rely on type inference and when to provide explicit type annotations, you can write Swift code that is both concise and clear.

## Exercises

1. Create a variable storing your age using type inference, then try to assign a string to it. What happens?
2. Create an array containing mixed types (integers and strings). What type does Swift infer for this array?
3. Write a function that accepts no parameters and returns an empty array of strings using type inference.
4. Create a dictionary with inferred types, then try to add a value of a different type. Observe the error.
5. Write a function that uses type inference to determine the return type based on a condition.
