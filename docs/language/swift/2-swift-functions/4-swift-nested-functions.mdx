# Swift Nested Functions

## Introduction

In Swift, functions are first-class citizens, which gives them a lot of flexibility in how you can use them. One powerful feature is the ability to define functions inside other functions. These are called **nested functions**.

Nested functions are defined within the body of another function and can access variables that are declared in the outer function. They are hidden from the outside world but can be called and used by their enclosing function. This creates a clean, organized way to encapsulate helper functionality that's only needed within a specific context.

Let's explore this concept with examples and understand how it can improve your code.

## Basic Nested Function Syntax

Here's the basic syntax for creating a nested function in Swift:

```swift
func outerFunction() {
    // Code in the outer function
    
    func nestedFunction() {
        // Code in the nested function
    }
    
    // Call the nested function
    nestedFunction()
}
```

The nested function is only available within the scope of the outer function. It cannot be called directly from outside the outer function.

## Simple Example of Nested Functions

Let's see a basic example of a nested function:

```swift
func greetPerson(name: String, isFormally: Bool) {
    func formalGreeting() {
        print("Good day, \(name).")
    }
    
    func casualGreeting() {
        print("Hey, \(name)!")
    }
    
    if isFormally {
        formalGreeting()
    } else {
        casualGreeting()
    }
}

// Using the function
greetPerson(name: "Alex", isFormally: true)   // Output: Good day, Alex.
greetPerson(name: "Emma", isFormally: false)  // Output: Hey, Emma!
```

In this example, `formalGreeting()` and `casualGreeting()` are nested within `greetPerson()`. They can access the `name` parameter from the outer function, and they're only called within the context of `greetPerson()`.

## Accessing Outer Function Variables

One of the most powerful aspects of nested functions is their ability to access variables from their containing function. This is similar to closures in Swift.

```swift
func counter() -> () -> Int {
    var count = 0
    
    func increment() -> Int {
        count += 1
        return count
    }
    
    return increment
}

let incrementCounter = counter()
print(incrementCounter()) // Output: 1
print(incrementCounter()) // Output: 2
print(incrementCounter()) // Output: 3
```

In this example, the nested function `increment()` can access and modify the `count` variable from its outer function. When we return the nested function, it still maintains access to `count` even after the outer function has finished executing.

## Practical Use Cases for Nested Functions

### 1. Breaking down complex algorithms

Nested functions can make complex algorithms more readable by breaking them down into smaller parts:

```swift
func calculateStatistics(for numbers: [Int]) -> (min: Int, max: Int, sum: Int, average: Double) {
    func findMinimum() -> Int {
        return numbers.min() ?? 0
    }
    
    func findMaximum() -> Int {
        return numbers.max() ?? 0
    }
    
    func calculateSum() -> Int {
        return numbers.reduce(0, +)
    }
    
    let min = findMinimum()
    let max = findMaximum()
    let sum = calculateSum()
    let average = numbers.isEmpty ? 0 : Double(sum) / Double(numbers.count)
    
    return (min, max, sum, average)
}

let stats = calculateStatistics(for: [5, 3, 9, 1, 7])
print("Min: \(stats.min), Max: \(stats.max), Sum: \(stats.sum), Average: \(stats.average)")
// Output: Min: 1, Max: 9, Sum: 25, Average: 5.0
```

### 2. Creating helper functions with limited scope

When you need helper functions that don't need to be accessible throughout your code:

```swift
func processUserInput(input: String) -> String {
    func sanitize(text: String) -> String {
        return text.trimmingCharacters(in: .whitespacesAndNewlines)
    }
    
    func validate(text: String) -> Bool {
        return !text.isEmpty
    }
    
    let sanitizedInput = sanitize(text: input)
    
    if validate(text: sanitizedInput) {
        return "Valid input: \(sanitizedInput)"
    } else {
        return "Invalid input"
    }
}

print(processUserInput(input: "   Hello World   "))  // Output: Valid input: Hello World
print(processUserInput(input: "   "))                // Output: Invalid input
```

### 3. Creating recursive algorithms

Nested functions are ideal for recursive algorithms that need helper functions:

```swift
func fibonacci(n: Int) -> [Int] {
    func fib(_ a: Int) -> Int {
        if a <= 1 {
            return a
        }
        return fib(a - 1) + fib(a - 2)
    }
    
    var sequence = [Int]()
    for i in 0..<n {
        sequence.append(fib(i))
    }
    return sequence
}

print(fibonacci(n: 10))  // Output: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]
```

## Returning Nested Functions

You can return a nested function from its containing function, which allows the nested function to be used outside its original scope:

```swift
func makeMultiplier(factor: Int) -> (Int) -> Int {
    func multiply(number: Int) -> Int {
        return number * factor
    }
    
    return multiply
}

let multiplyByFive = makeMultiplier(factor: 5)
print(multiplyByFive(2))  // Output: 10
print(multiplyByFive(3))  // Output: 15

let multiplyByTen = makeMultiplier(factor: 10)
print(multiplyByTen(2))   // Output: 20
```

This is a common pattern in Swift programming and is one way to implement what's known as a factory function.

## Nested Functions vs. Local Functions

Nested functions in Swift are sometimes called local functions as well. They serve the same purpose as local functions in other programming languages: to encapsulate functionality that's only needed within a specific context.

However, Swift's nested functions have additional power because they can capture and modify variables from their containing scope, similar to closures.

## Nested Functions vs. Closures

Nested functions and closures are closely related in Swift. The main differences are:

1. Syntax: Nested functions use the `func` keyword and have a name, while closures have a more compact syntax and are often anonymous.

2. Usage: Nested functions are typically defined when you need named helper functions with complex logic, while closures are often used for shorter, inline functionality.

Here's a comparison:

```swift
// Using a nested function
func processArray(array: [Int], operation: String) -> [Int] {
    func double(number: Int) -> Int {
        return number * 2
    }
    
    func square(number: Int) -> Int {
        return number * number
    }
    
    if operation == "double" {
        return array.map(double)
    } else {
        return array.map(square)
    }
}

// Using closures
func processArrayWithClosures(array: [Int], operation: String) -> [Int] {
    if operation == "double" {
        return array.map { $0 * 2 }
    } else {
        return array.map { $0 * $0 }
    }
}

let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(processArray(array: numbers, operation: "double"))  // Output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
print(processArrayWithClosures(array: numbers, operation: "square"))  // Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
```

Both approaches are valid, and the choice depends on readability and the complexity of the operation.

## Best Practices for Nested Functions

1. **Keep them focused**: Nested functions should have a single responsibility that helps the outer function accomplish its task.

2. **Consider scope**: If a function is only needed inside another function, making it nested can help maintain clean namespace.

3. **Don't over-nest**: Avoid nesting functions too deeply, as it can make code harder to read and debug.

4. **Use meaningful names**: Give nested functions clear names that indicate their purpose within the outer function.

5. **Consider refactoring**: If a nested function becomes complex or reusable elsewhere, consider moving it out to be a separate function.

## Summary

Nested functions in Swift allow you to define functions inside other functions, giving you several benefits:

- Encapsulation of helper functionality
- Access to variables from the containing function
- Cleaner code organization
- Limited scope for functions that shouldn't be accessible globally

By understanding and using nested functions effectively, you can write more organized, maintainable Swift code that follows good encapsulation practices.

## Exercises

2. Write a function that sorts an array of strings by their length, using nested functions to handle the comparison logic.

3. Create a tax calculator function that has nested functions for different tax brackets and returns the total tax due.

4. Write a game score tracker that uses nested functions to track and calculate different point categories.

5. Create a function that returns another function that applies a specific formatting to strings.
