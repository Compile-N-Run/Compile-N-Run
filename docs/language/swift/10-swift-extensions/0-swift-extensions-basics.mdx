# Swift Extensions Basics

## Introduction

Extensions are one of Swift's most powerful features that allow you to add new functionality to existing classes, structures, enumerations, or protocols—even if you don't have access to the original source code. Think of extensions as a way to "extend" the capabilities of types without subclassing or modifying their original implementation.

In this guide, we'll explore how extensions work, their benefits, and how you can use them effectively in your Swift projects.

## What Are Extensions?

Swift extensions enable you to:

- Add new methods and properties to existing types
- Add new initializers
- Make a type conform to a protocol
- Provide default implementations for protocol requirements
- Extend functionality without access to the original source code

The syntax for declaring an extension is simple:

```swift
extension SomeType {
    // New functionality for SomeType goes here
}
```

## Basic Extension Examples

### Adding Methods to Existing Types

Let's start with a simple example by adding a method to Swift's built-in `String` type:

```swift
extension String {
    func addExclamation() -> String {
        return self + "!"
    }
}

// Using the new method
let greeting = "Hello"
let excitedGreeting = greeting.addExclamation()
print(excitedGreeting) // Output: "Hello!"
```

In this example, we've added a new method to all strings in our program. This is much cleaner than creating a helper function that would take a string as a parameter.

### Adding Computed Properties

Extensions can add new computed properties, but not stored properties:

```swift
extension Double {
    var km: Double { return self * 1000.0 }
    var m: Double { return self }
    var cm: Double { return self / 100.0 }
    var mm: Double { return self / 1000.0 }
}

let distance = 42.0
print("\(distance) kilometers is \(distance.km) meters")
// Output: "42.0 kilometers is 42000.0 meters"
print("3.5 meters is \(3.5.mm) millimeters")
// Output: "3.5 meters is 0.0035 millimeters"
```

This example adds useful unit conversions as computed properties to the `Double` type.

## Initializers in Extensions

You can add new initializers to types using extensions:

```swift
struct Point {
    var x: Int
    var y: Int
}

extension Point {
    init(bothCoordinates: Int) {
        self.init(x: bothCoordinates, y: bothCoordinates)
    }
}

// Using the new initializer
let point = Point(bothCoordinates: 10)
print("Point coordinates: (\(point.x), \(point.y))")
// Output: "Point coordinates: (10, 10)"
```

Note: Extensions cannot add designated initializers or deinitializers to classes. Those must be part of the original class implementation.

## Protocol Conformance with Extensions

One of the most powerful uses of extensions is adding protocol conformance to a type:

```swift
protocol TextRepresentable {
    var textDescription: String { get }
}

struct Person {
    var name: String
    var age: Int
}

extension Person: TextRepresentable {
    var textDescription: String {
        return "Person: \(name), \(age) years old"
    }
}

let john = Person(name: "John", age: 35)
print(john.textDescription)
// Output: "Person: John, 35 years old"
```

By using an extension to add protocol conformance, we keep the original type definition clean and separate from its protocol conformance details.

## Organizational Benefits of Extensions

Extensions help organize code better. You can group related functionality together:

```swift
// Original type definition
struct Temperature {
    var celsius: Double
}

// Extension for conversion functionality
extension Temperature {
    var fahrenheit: Double {
        return celsius * 9/5 + 32
    }
    
    var kelvin: Double {
        return celsius + 273.15
    }
}

// Extension for string representation
extension Temperature {
    func toString() -> String {
        return String(format: "%.1f°C", celsius)
    }
}

let roomTemp = Temperature(celsius: 22.5)
print("Room temperature is \(roomTemp.toString())")
// Output: "Room temperature is 22.5°C"
print("That's \(roomTemp.fahrenheit) degrees Fahrenheit")
// Output: "That's 72.5 degrees Fahrenheit"
```

This approach makes your code more modular and easier to maintain.

## Real-World Application: Building a Rich User Interface Element

Let's see how extensions can be practical in a real app scenario. Imagine we want to create a stylized button:

```swift
import UIKit

// Base class from UIKit
// We can't modify UIButton's source code, but we can extend it

extension UIButton {
    func applyPrimaryStyle() {
        self.backgroundColor = .systemBlue
        self.setTitleColor(.white, for: .normal)
        self.layer.cornerRadius = 10
        self.titleLabel?.font = UIFont.systemFont(ofSize: 16, weight: .bold)
        self.contentEdgeInsets = UIEdgeInsets(top: 12, left: 16, bottom: 12, right: 16)
    }
    
    func applySecondaryStyle() {
        self.backgroundColor = .systemGray5
        self.setTitleColor(.darkGray, for: .normal)
        self.layer.cornerRadius = 10
        self.titleLabel?.font = UIFont.systemFont(ofSize: 16, weight: .medium)
        self.contentEdgeInsets = UIEdgeInsets(top: 10, left: 14, bottom: 10, right: 14)
    }
}

// Usage in a view controller:
/*
override func viewDidLoad() {
    super.viewDidLoad()
    
    let primaryButton = UIButton()
    primaryButton.setTitle("Sign Up", for: .normal)
    primaryButton.applyPrimaryStyle()
    view.addSubview(primaryButton)
    
    let secondaryButton = UIButton()
    secondaryButton.setTitle("Cancel", for: .normal) 
    secondaryButton.applySecondaryStyle()
    view.addSubview(secondaryButton)
}
*/
```

This example shows how we can use extensions to add styling methods to UIKit components, making our UI code more consistent and reusable.

## Limitations of Extensions

While extensions are powerful, they have some limitations:

1. You cannot add stored properties to existing types
2. You cannot add property observers to existing properties
3. Class extensions cannot add designated initializers or deinitializers
4. Extensions cannot override existing functionality (unlike subclassing)

## Best Practices

Here are some guidelines for using extensions effectively:

1. **Keep related functionality together**: Group related methods and properties in the same extension
2. **Use extensions for organization**: Create separate extensions for different protocol conformances
3. **Don't overuse**: Extensions are not a replacement for proper class design
4. **Prefer extensions over global functions**: Instead of creating utility functions, extend the relevant types

## Summary

Swift extensions allow you to add new functionality to existing types without modifying their original source code. They're incredibly useful for:

- Adding methods, computed properties, and initializers
- Making types conform to protocols
- Organizing code in a more readable way
- Creating reusable utilities

Extensions embody Swift's philosophy of protocol-oriented programming and help create cleaner, more maintainable code. The ability to extend types you don't own (like Swift standard library types or UIKit components) is particularly powerful for building consistent APIs and abstractions.

## Practice Exercises

1. Create an extension on `Int` that adds a `isEven` and `isOdd` computed property
2. Extend `Array` to add a method that returns a random element (or nil if the array is empty)
3. Make a `Circle` struct with a radius property, then use an extension to add area and perimeter computed properties
4. Extend `UITextField` to add methods for common validation (email format, non-empty, etc.)
5. Create a `CustomStringConvertible` extension for a custom type to provide a better debug description
