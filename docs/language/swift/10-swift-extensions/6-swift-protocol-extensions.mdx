# Swift Protocol Extensions

## Introduction

Protocol extensions are a powerful feature in Swift that allows you to extend a protocol to provide default implementations for methods, properties, and subscripts that conforming types can use. This feature combines the flexibility of protocols with the power of extensions, enabling you to define behavior once and apply it to multiple types.

In this tutorial, we'll explore how protocol extensions work, why they're useful, and how to implement them effectively in your Swift code.

## What Are Protocol Extensions?

In Swift, protocols define a blueprint of methods, properties, and other requirements that conforming types must implement. However, writing the same functionality for each conforming type can be repetitive. This is where protocol extensions come in.

**Protocol extensions allow you to:**
- Add default implementations to protocol requirements
- Add new functionality to all conforming types
- Extend existing protocols without modifying the original code

Let's look at the basic syntax:

```swift
protocol SomeProtocol {
    func requiredMethod()
}

extension SomeProtocol {
    func requiredMethod() {
        print("Default implementation")
    }
    
    func additionalMethod() {
        print("Additional functionality")
    }
}
```

## Providing Default Implementations

One of the most common uses of protocol extensions is to provide default implementations for protocol requirements.

### Example: Creating a Describable Protocol

```swift
protocol Describable {
    var description: String { get }
}

extension Describable {
    var description: String {
        return "This is a \(type(of: self))"
    }
}

struct Person: Describable {
    let name: String
    let age: Int
    // Notice we don't implement description
}

let person = Person(name: "John", age: 30)
print(person.description)  // Output: This is a Person
```

In this example, `Person` automatically gets the default implementation of `description` without having to implement it.

## Adding New Functionality

Protocol extensions can also add completely new functionality that wasn't in the original protocol definition.

### Example: Adding Utility Methods to Collections

```swift
protocol Collection {
    // Collection protocol requirements...
}

extension Collection {
    func printAll() {
        for item in self {
            print(item)
        }
    }
    
    var isNotEmpty: Bool {
        return !isEmpty
    }
}

let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
numbers.printAll()
// Output:
// 1
// 2
// 3
// 4
// 5

if numbers.isNotEmpty {
    print("The array has \(numbers.count) items")
}
// Output: The array has 5 items
```

Now all collections in Swift (arrays, sets, dictionaries) have access to these new methods.

## Protocol Extensions vs. Subclassing

Protocol extensions offer several advantages over traditional class inheritance:

1. **Multiple conformance**: Types can conform to multiple protocols
2. **Value types**: Protocol extensions work with structs and enums, not just classes
3. **No override confusion**: Less complex method dispatch

### Example: Protocol Extensions with Value Types

```swift
protocol Movable {
    var position: (x: Int, y: Int) { get set }
}

extension Movable {
    mutating func moveUp() {
        position.y += 1
    }
    
    mutating func moveDown() {
        position.y -= 1
    }
    
    mutating func moveLeft() {
        position.x -= 1
    }
    
    mutating func moveRight() {
        position.x += 1
    }
}

struct Player: Movable {
    var position: (x: Int, y: Int)
    let name: String
}

struct Enemy: Movable {
    var position: (x: Int, y: Int)
    let type: String
}

var player = Player(position: (x: 0, y: 0), name: "Hero")
player.moveRight()
player.moveUp()
print("Player position: \(player.position)")  // Output: Player position: (x: 1, y: 1)

var enemy = Enemy(position: (x: 10, y: 10), type: "Dragon")
enemy.moveLeft()
enemy.moveDown()
print("Enemy position: \(enemy.position)")  // Output: Enemy position: (x: 9, y: 9)
```

Both structs get movement functionality without duplication or inheritance!

## Conditional Protocol Extensions

You can also extend a protocol conditionally, which means the extension only applies when certain conditions are met.

### Example: Extending Only Arrays of Integers

```swift
extension Collection where Element == Int {
    var sum: Int {
        return reduce(0, +)
    }
    
    var average: Double {
        guard !isEmpty else { return 0 }
        return Double(sum) / Double(count)
    }
}

let scores = [85, 90, 78, 93, 88]
print("Sum: \(scores.sum)")  // Output: Sum: 434
print("Average: \(scores.average)")  // Output: Average: 86.8

// This won't compile because the elements are not integers
// let names = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"]
// print(names.sum)  // Error!
```

## Protocol Extension Method Dispatch

An important aspect to understand about protocol extensions is how method dispatch works. Consider this example:

```swift
protocol Drawable {
    func draw()
}

extension Drawable {
    func draw() {
        print("Drawing default implementation")
    }
    
    func sketch() {
        print("Sketching from protocol extension")
    }
}

class Circle: Drawable {
    func draw() {
        print("Drawing a circle")
    }
    
    func sketch() {
        print("Sketching a circle")
    }
}

let circleAsCircle = Circle()
circleAsCircle.draw()      // Output: Drawing a circle
circleAsCircle.sketch()    // Output: Sketching a circle

let circleAsDrawable: Drawable = Circle()
circleAsDrawable.draw()    // Output: Drawing a circle
circleAsDrawable.sketch()  // Output: Sketching from protocol extension
```

Note that when `circleAsDrawable` calls `sketch()`, it uses the protocol extension's implementation, even though `Circle` has its own implementation. This is because `sketch()` is not part of the `Drawable` protocol but is added through an extension.

## Real-World Applications

Let's look at some practical applications of protocol extensions:

### Example 1: Creating a Custom String Representation

```swift
protocol CustomStringProvider {
    var customString: String { get }
}

extension CustomStringProvider {
    var customString: String {
        return "\(self)"
    }
    
    func printCustomString() {
        print(customString)
    }
}

struct Product: CustomStringProvider {
    let name: String
    let price: Double
    
    // Override the default implementation
    var customString: String {
        return "\(name): $\(String(format: "%.2f", price))"
    }
}

let laptop = Product(name: "MacBook Pro", price: 1999.99)
laptop.printCustomString()  // Output: MacBook Pro: $1999.99
```

### Example 2: Adding Functionality to Swift's Standard Library

```swift
extension Sequence where Element: Numeric {
    func squared() -> [Element] {
        return map { $0 * $0 }
    }
}

let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
let squaredNumbers = numbers.squared()
print(squaredNumbers)  // Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]

let decimals = [1.5, 2.5, 3.5]
let squaredDecimals = decimals.squared()
print(squaredDecimals)  // Output: [2.25, 6.25, 12.25]
```

### Example 3: Building a Logging System

```swift
protocol Loggable {
    var logIdentifier: String { get }
}

extension Loggable {
    var logIdentifier: String {
        return "\(type(of: self))"
    }
    
    func log(_ message: String) {
        print("[\(logIdentifier)] \(message)")
    }
    
    func logError(_ error: Error) {
        log("ERROR: \(error.localizedDescription)")
    }
}

class NetworkService: Loggable {
    func fetchData() {
        log("Starting data fetch...")
        // Network code here...
        log("Data fetch completed")
    }
    
    // Custom log identifier
    var logIdentifier: String {
        return "NetworkService"
    }
}

struct UserManager: Loggable {
    func createUser(name: String) {
        log("Creating user: \(name)")
        // User creation code...
    }
}

let network = NetworkService()
network.fetchData()
// Output: 
// [NetworkService] Starting data fetch...
// [NetworkService] Data fetch completed

let userManager = UserManager()
userManager.createUser(name: "John")
// Output: [UserManager] Creating user: John
```

## Summary

Protocol extensions are a powerful feature of Swift that allows you to:

1. Provide default implementations for protocol requirements
2. Add new functionality to types that conform to a protocol
3. Extend existing protocols without modifying their original definition
4. Apply extensions conditionally based on constraints
5. Share code across different types without relying on inheritance

This feature is central to Swift's protocol-oriented programming paradigm and enables more flexible and less coupled code design compared to traditional object-oriented approaches.

### Exercises

1. **Basic Protocol Extension**: Create a `Shapeable` protocol with properties for `area` and `perimeter`. Implement default methods in an extension that prints these values.

2. **Extending Standard Library**: Extend the `Array` protocol to add a `shuffle()` method that returns a new array with randomly ordered elements.

3. **Conditional Extensions**: Create a protocol for `Stackable` items and extend it conditionally to provide different implementations based on the element type.

4. **Protocol Composition**: Create multiple protocols with extensions and use protocol composition to combine their functionality in a single type.

5. **Real-World Example**: Design a `CacheManager` protocol with extensions that provide default implementations for caching strategies like LRU (Least Recently Used) or FIFO (First In, First Out).

By practicing these exercises, you'll gain a deeper understanding of how protocol extensions can be applied to solve real problems in your Swift applications.
