# Swift Tuple Pattern

## Introduction

Tuple patterns are one of Swift's most powerful pattern matching features that allow you to match and extract values from tuples in a concise and readable way. Tuples themselves are ordered collections of values grouped together, and tuple patterns provide a mechanism to match against the structure and content of these grouped values.

In this tutorial, we'll explore how to use tuple patterns in Swift for pattern matching, destructuring complex data, and writing more elegant code. Whether you're working with function returns that include multiple values or matching complex data structures, tuple patterns can significantly improve your code's readability and maintenance.

## Understanding Tuples in Swift

Before diving into tuple patterns, let's quickly review what tuples are in Swift:

```swift
// A simple tuple containing two values
let person = ("John", 25)

// Accessing tuple elements by index
let name = person.0  // "John"
let age = person.1   // 25

// A named tuple
let employee = (name: "Sarah", id: 1001, role: "Developer")
let employeeName = employee.name  // "Sarah"
```

Tuples group multiple values into a single compound value. They're particularly useful when you need to return multiple values from a function or temporarily group related values.

## Basic Tuple Pattern Matching

The simplest form of tuple pattern matching allows you to decompose a tuple into its constituent parts:

```swift
let httpResponse = (404, "Not Found")

// Match the entire tuple structure
switch httpResponse {
case (200, "OK"):
    print("Everything is fine")
case (404, "Not Found"):
    print("Resource not found")
case (401, _):
    print("Unauthorized")
default:
    print("Some other HTTP status")
}
// Output: Resource not found
```

In this example, we're matching against the entire tuple's structure and values. The `_` wildcard pattern in `(401, _)` matches any value in the second position.

## Destructuring with Tuple Patterns

One of the most common uses of tuple patterns is to extract values from tuples into separate constants or variables:

```swift
let point = (x: 10, y: 20, z: 30)

// Destructure the tuple into individual constants
let (x, y, z) = point
print("x: \(x), y: \(y), z: \(z)")
// Output: x: 10, y: 20, z: 30

// Ignore values you don't need
let (onlyX, _, _) = point
print("Only extracted x: \(onlyX)")
// Output: Only extracted x: 10
```

This powerful feature allows you to extract just the values you need from a tuple, making your code more readable and focused.

## Partial Matching with Tuple Patterns

Swift allows you to match only parts of a tuple that you're interested in:

```swift
let coordinates = [(0, 0), (10, -5), (15, 30), (-10, 5)]

for point in coordinates {
    switch point {
    case (0, 0):
        print("Origin")
    case (let x, 0):
        print("On x-axis at \(x)")
    case (0, let y):
        print("On y-axis at \(y)")
    case (let x, let y) where x == y:
        print("On the line x = y at \(x)")
    case let (x, y):
        print("Point at \(x), \(y)")
    }
}
// Output:
// Origin
// Point at 10, -5
// Point at 15, 30
// Point at -10, 5
```

In this example, we use different tuple patterns to match various types of points in a coordinate system.

## Using the Binding Pattern with Tuples

The binding pattern (`let` or `var`) can be used with tuple patterns to create variables or constants from matched values:

```swift
let measurements = (temperature: 21.5, humidity: 0.7, pressure: 1001.5)

switch measurements {
case (let temp, _, _) where temp > 30:
    print("It's hot: \(temp)째C")
case (let temp, let humidity, _) where humidity > 0.8:
    print("It's humid: \(temp)째C with \(humidity * 100)% humidity")
case let (temp, humidity, pressure):
    print("Normal conditions: \(temp)째C, \(humidity * 100)% humidity, \(pressure) hPa")
}
// Output: Normal conditions: 21.5째C, 70.0% humidity, 1001.5 hPa
```

Here, we're binding parts of the tuple to variables that we can then use in our case conditions or statements.

## Nested Tuple Patterns

Tuple patterns can be nested to match complex data structures:

```swift
let personData = (name: "Alex", age: 28, contact: (email: "alex@example.com", phone: "555-1234"))

switch personData {
case (let name, let age, (let email, _)) where age < 18:
    print("Minor: \(name), email: \(email)")
case (let name, _, (_, let phone)) where name.hasPrefix("A"):
    print("A-person: \(name), phone: \(phone)")
case let (name, age, (email, _)):
    print("\(name), \(age): contact at \(email)")
}
// Output: A-person: Alex, phone: 555-1234
```

Nested tuple patterns allow you to drill down into nested tuple structures and apply conditional matching at any level.

## Tuple Patterns in Function Parameters

Tuple patterns can also be used directly in function parameters for immediate destructuring:

```swift
func processUserData((name, age, profession): (String, Int, String)) {
    print("Processing data for \(name), \(age) years old, working as \(profession)")
}

let userData = ("Emma", 34, "Engineer")
processUserData(userData)
// Output: Processing data for Emma, 34 years old, working as Engineer
```

This approach allows you to work directly with the tuple's components without having to manually decompose it inside the function.

## Real-World Applications

### 1. Processing API Responses

When working with APIs that return multiple values, tuple patterns can make handling responses much cleaner:

```swift
func fetchUserData() -> (success: Bool, data: [String: Any]?, error: Error?) {
    // Simulating an API response
    return (true, ["name": "John", "id": 123], nil)
}

let result = fetchUserData()

switch result {
case (true, let data?, nil):
    if let name = data["name"] as? String, let id = data["id"] as? Int {
        print("User: \(name), ID: \(id)")
    }
case (false, _, let error?):
    print("Error fetching user: \(error.localizedDescription)")
default:
    print("Unexpected result state")
}
// Output: User: John, ID: 123
```

### 2. Handling Coordinates or Geometrical Data

Tuple patterns are perfect for geometric calculations:

```swift
func classifyTriangle(points: [(Int, Int)]) -> String {
    guard points.count == 3 else { return "Not a triangle" }
    
    // Calculate distances between points
    let distances = [
        calculateDistance(points[0], points[1]),
        calculateDistance(points[1], points[2]),
        calculateDistance(points[2], points[0])
    ].sorted()
    
    switch distances {
    case let (a, b, c) where a == b && b == c:
        return "Equilateral triangle"
    case let (a, b, c) where a == b || b == c:
        return "Isosceles triangle"
    case let (a, b, c) where a*a + b*b == c*c:
        return "Right triangle"
    default:
        return "Scalene triangle"
    }
}

func calculateDistance(_ p1: (Int, Int), _ p2: (Int, Int)) -> Double {
    let (x1, y1) = p1
    let (x2, y2) = p2
    return sqrt(Double((x2 - x1) * (x2 - x1) + (y2 - y1) * (y2 - y1)))
}

let trianglePoints = [(0, 0), (0, 3), (4, 0)]
print(classifyTriangle(points: trianglePoints))
// Output: Right triangle
```

### 3. Parsing Structured Data

When parsing structured data like CSV records, tuple patterns can simplify your code:

```swift
func parseCSVRecord(_ record: String) -> (name: String, age: Int, email: String)? {
    let fields = record.split(separator: ",").map(String.init)
    
    guard fields.count == 3,
          let age = Int(fields[1].trimmingCharacters(in: .whitespaces)) else {
        return nil
    }
    
    return (
        name: fields[0].trimmingCharacters(in: .whitespaces),
        age: age,
        email: fields[2].trimmingCharacters(in: .whitespaces)
    )
}

let csvRecord = "John Smith, 35, john@example.com"
if let (name, age, email) = parseCSVRecord(csvRecord) {
    print("\(name) is \(age) years old with email \(email)")
}
// Output: John Smith is 35 years old with email john@example.com
```

## Summary

Tuple patterns in Swift provide a powerful way to:

1. **Match tuple structures** in switch statements
2. **Destructure complex data** into individual variables
3. **Apply conditions** to specific tuple elements
4. **Extract only the values** you need while ignoring others
5. **Nest patterns** to match complex, hierarchical data structures

By mastering tuple patterns, you can write more expressive, concise code that's easier to read and maintain. They're especially useful when working with APIs, processing structured data, or handling geometric calculations.

## Exercises

To reinforce your understanding of tuple patterns, try these exercises:

1. Write a function that takes a tuple representing a date `(year, month, day)` and returns a season (Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter) based on the month.

2. Create a function that classifies points in a 2D space based on their quadrant (I, II, III, or IV) or if they lie on an axis.

3. Implement a simple calculator function that takes a tuple of `(leftOperand, operation, rightOperand)` where operation is a string like "+", "-", "*", or "/".

4. Parse a string representing a color in RGB format (e.g., "rgb(255, 0, 128)") into a tuple of three integers representing the red, green, and blue components.
