# Swift Class Methods

## Introduction

Class methods in Swift are functions that belong to the class itself rather than to instances of the class. They are called directly on the class without needing to create an object first. These methods are also known as **type methods** or **static methods** in Swift. They're particularly useful when you need functionality related to a class but that doesn't require an instance of the class to operate.

In this tutorial, we'll explore:
- What class methods are and why they're useful
- How to define class methods using `static` and `class` keywords
- When to use class methods vs instance methods
- Practical examples of class methods in real applications

## Understanding Class Methods

### What Are Class Methods?

In Swift, class methods (or type methods) belong to the type itself, not to instances of that type. This means:
- They are called on the class directly, not on an instance
- They cannot access instance properties or methods directly
- They're useful for functionality that is related to the class as a whole

### Defining Class Methods in Swift

Swift provides two keywords for creating class methods:

1. **`static`** - Used to define methods that cannot be overridden by subclasses
2. **`class`** - Used to define methods that can be overridden by subclasses (only available for classes, not structs or enums)

Let's look at how to define and use class methods:

```swift
class MathHelper {
    // Static method - cannot be overridden
    static func square(_ number: Int) -> Int {
        return number * number
    }
    
    // Class method - can be overridden by subclasses
    class func cube(_ number: Int) -> Int {
        return number * number * number
    }
}

// Using the class methods
let squaredValue = MathHelper.square(4)  // 16
let cubedValue = MathHelper.cube(3)      // 27

print("4 squared is \(squaredValue)")
print("3 cubed is \(cubedValue)")
```

Output:
```
4 squared is 16
3 cubed is 27
```

Notice how we call these methods directly on the class name (`MathHelper`), not on an instance of the class.

## Static vs Class Methods

The main difference between `static` and `class` methods is whether they can be overridden in subclasses:

```swift
class Shape {
    static func description() -> String {
        return "A geometric shape"
    }
    
    class func create() -> String {
        return "Creating a shape"
    }
}

class Circle: Shape {
    // This would cause an error - cannot override static method
    // static override func description() -> String {
    //     return "A round shape"
    // }
    
    // This works fine - class methods can be overridden
    override class func create() -> String {
        return "Creating a circle"
    }
}

print(Shape.description())   // "A geometric shape"
print(Circle.description())  // "A geometric shape"
print(Shape.create())        // "Creating a shape"
print(Circle.create())       // "Creating a circle"
```

Output:
```
A geometric shape
A geometric shape
Creating a shape
Creating a circle
```

## When to Use Class Methods

Class methods are particularly useful in several scenarios:

1. **Factory Methods**: Creating specialized instances of a class
2. **Utility Functions**: Methods that perform operations related to the class but don't need instance data
3. **Constants and Configuration**: Accessing class-wide settings or constants
4. **Singletons**: Managing shared instances

Let's explore these use cases with practical examples.

### Example 1: Factory Methods

Factory methods create and return instances of a class with specific configurations:

```swift
class UIButton {
    var title: String
    var color: String
    
    init(title: String, color: String) {
        self.title = title
        self.color = color
    }
    
    // Factory method to create a standard "Submit" button
    static func createSubmitButton() -> UIButton {
        return UIButton(title: "Submit", color: "blue")
    }
    
    // Factory method to create a standard "Cancel" button
    static func createCancelButton() -> UIButton {
        return UIButton(title: "Cancel", color: "red")
    }
}

// Using the factory methods
let submitButton = UIButton.createSubmitButton()
let cancelButton = UIButton.createCancelButton()

print("Created a \(submitButton.color) \(submitButton.title) button")
print("Created a \(cancelButton.color) \(cancelButton.title) button")
```

Output:
```
Created a blue Submit button
Created a red Cancel button
```

### Example 2: Utility Functions

Class methods are perfect for utility functions related to the class purpose:

```swift
class DateFormatter {
    // Instance properties and methods would go here
    
    // Class method for common date formatting tasks
    static func formatAsShortDate(_ date: Date) -> String {
        let formatter = DateFormatter()
        formatter.dateStyle = .short
        return formatter.string(from: date)
    }
    
    static func formatAsLongDate(_ date: Date) -> String {
        let formatter = DateFormatter()
        formatter.dateStyle = .long
        return formatter.string(from: date)
    }
}

let today = Date()
print("Short format: \(DateFormatter.formatAsShortDate(today))")
print("Long format: \(DateFormatter.formatAsLongDate(today))")
```

Output (example):
```
Short format: 7/25/23
Long format: July 25, 2023
```

### Example 3: Constants and Configuration

Class methods can provide access to class-wide constants:

```swift
class AppSettings {
    // Private properties to store settings
    private static let defaultUsername = "guest"
    private static let defaultTheme = "light"
    
    // Class methods to access settings
    static func getDefaultUsername() -> String {
        return defaultUsername
    }
    
    static func getDefaultTheme() -> String {
        return defaultTheme
    }
}

print("Default username: \(AppSettings.getDefaultUsername())")
print("Default theme: \(AppSettings.getDefaultTheme())")
```

Output:
```
Default username: guest
Default theme: light
```

### Example 4: Singleton Pattern

Class methods are commonly used to implement the singleton pattern:

```swift
class DatabaseManager {
    // Shared instance (singleton)
    private static let sharedInstance = DatabaseManager()
    
    // Private initializer prevents direct instantiation
    private init() {
        // Setup database connection
        print("Database initialized")
    }
    
    // Class method to access the singleton
    static func shared() -> DatabaseManager {
        return sharedInstance
    }
    
    // Instance methods
    func query(_ sql: String) {
        print("Executing query: \(sql)")
    }
}

// Using the singleton
let db = DatabaseManager.shared()
db.query("SELECT * FROM users")
```

Output:
```
Database initialized
Executing query: SELECT * FROM users
```

## Class Methods vs Instance Methods

To understand when to use class methods versus instance methods, consider these guidelines:

| Use Class Methods When... | Use Instance Methods When... |
|---------------------------|------------------------------|
| The functionality doesn't need instance state | The functionality depends on instance properties |
| Providing factory or helper methods | Working with the specific instance's data |
| Defining behavior that applies to all instances | Defining behavior unique to each instance |
| Implementing shared resources or singletons | Implementing instance-specific behavior |

## Practical Application: Building a User Authentication System

Let's put everything together in a more comprehensive example of a user authentication system:

```swift
class Authentication {
    // Private properties
    private static let minimumPasswordLength = 8
    private var username: String
    private var loggedIn: Bool = false
    
    // Initializer
    init(username: String) {
        self.username = username
    }
    
    // Class methods
    static func isValidPassword(_ password: String) -> Bool {
        return password.count >= minimumPasswordLength
    }
    
    static func hashPassword(_ password: String) -> String {
        // This is a simplified example - don't use this for real password hashing!
        return password.reversed() + "hashed"
    }
    
    // Instance methods
    func login(password: String) -> Bool {
        // In a real app, we would verify against stored credentials
        if Authentication.isValidPassword(password) {
            loggedIn = true
            return true
        }
        return false
    }
    
    func logout() {
        loggedIn = false
    }
    
    func status() -> String {
        return loggedIn ? "\(username) is logged in" : "\(username) is logged out"
    }
}

// Using class methods directly
let isValid = Authentication.isValidPassword("12345")
print("Is '12345' a valid password? \(isValid)")

let hashedPassword = Authentication.hashPassword("securePassword123")
print("Hashed password: \(hashedPassword)")

// Using instance methods
let userAuth = Authentication(username: "swift_learner")
print(userAuth.status())

let loginSuccess = userAuth.login(password: "password123")
print("Login successful? \(loginSuccess)")
print(userAuth.status())

userAuth.logout()
print(userAuth.status())
```

Output:
```
Is '12345' a valid password? false
Hashed password: 321drowPerucesdehsah
swift_learner is logged out
Login successful? true
swift_learner is logged in
swift_learner is logged out
```

## Summary

Class methods in Swift provide a powerful way to define functionality that belongs to the class itself rather than to individual instances. They are defined using the `static` or `class` keywords and can be called directly on the class name.

Key points to remember:
- Use `static` for methods that shouldn't be overridden by subclasses
- Use `class` for methods that can be overridden (only available in classes)
- Class methods can't directly access instance properties or methods
- They're ideal for factory methods, utility functions, constants, and singletons

Class methods help organize your code by clearly separating class-wide functionality from instance-specific behavior, making your code more modular and easier to understand.

## Exercises

To solidify your understanding, try these exercises:

1. Create a `Calculator` class with static methods for basic operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide).
2. Implement a `StringUtils` class with static methods to capitalize, reverse, and count words in a string.
3. Create a `UserProfile` class with both instance methods and class methods. Include a static method to validate email addresses and instance methods to update user information.
4. Implement the singleton pattern for a `Logger` class that records application events.
