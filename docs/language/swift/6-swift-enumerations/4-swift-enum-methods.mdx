# Swift Enum Methods

## Introduction

Enumerations in Swift aren't just simple value types - they're powerful constructs that can include methods, computed properties, and other features typically associated with classes and structures. By adding methods to enumerations, you can encapsulate functionality directly within your enum types, making your code more organized and maintaining proper encapsulation.

In this tutorial, we'll explore how to add methods to Swift enumerations and how they can make your code more expressive and maintainable.

## Understanding Enum Methods

Methods in enumerations work similarly to methods in classes and structures. They allow you to define behaviors that are closely related to the enum itself. 

### Instance Methods

Instance methods are functions that belong to instances of a particular type. In the context of enums, they can operate on the enum case itself.

```swift
enum Direction {
    case north, south, east, west
    
    func description() -> String {
        switch self {
        case .north:
            return "Heading north"
        case .south:
            return "Heading south"
        case .east:
            return "Heading east"
        case .west:
            return "Heading west"
        }
    }
}

let myDirection = Direction.east
print(myDirection.description())
// Output: Heading east
```

In this example, we've added a `description()` method to the `Direction` enum that returns a string describing the direction.

### Mutating Methods

If you want to modify the enum instance itself within a method, you need to mark the method with the `mutating` keyword.

```swift
enum ToggleSwitch {
    case on, off
    
    mutating func toggle() {
        switch self {
        case .on:
            self = .off
        case .off:
            self = .on
        }
    }
}

var lightSwitch = ToggleSwitch.off
print("Initial state: \(lightSwitch)")
// Output: Initial state: off

lightSwitch.toggle()
print("After toggle: \(lightSwitch)")
// Output: After toggle: on
```

The `toggle()` method changes the enum value from `.on` to `.off` or vice versa. Since it modifies `self`, we mark it as `mutating`.

## Advanced Enum Methods

### Methods with Parameters

Methods in enums can accept parameters just like methods in other types:

```swift
enum Calculator {
    case addition, subtraction, multiplication, division
    
    func calculate(_ a: Double, _ b: Double) -> Double {
        switch self {
        case .addition:
            return a + b
        case .subtraction:
            return a - b
        case .multiplication:
            return a * b
        case .division:
            return a / b
        }
    }
}

let operation = Calculator.addition
print(operation.calculate(5, 3))
// Output: 8.0

let multiply = Calculator.multiplication
print(multiply.calculate(4, 2))
// Output: 8.0
```

### Static Methods

Static methods belong to the enum type itself, not to instances of the enum:

```swift
enum MathOperations {
    case add, subtract, multiply, divide
    
    static func randomOperation() -> MathOperations {
        let operations: [MathOperations] = [.add, .subtract, .multiply, .divide]
        let randomIndex = Int.random(in: 0..<operations.count)
        return operations[randomIndex]
    }
}

let randomOp = MathOperations.randomOperation()
print("Random operation: \(randomOp)")
// Output will vary, e.g.: Random operation: add
```

## Enums with Associated Values and Methods

When using enums with associated values, methods can access and use these values:

```swift
enum Item {
    case book(title: String, author: String, pages: Int)
    case movie(title: String, director: String, duration: Int)
    
    func description() -> String {
        switch self {
        case .book(let title, let author, let pages):
            return "\"\(title)\" by \(author), \(pages) pages"
        case .movie(let title, let director, let duration):
            return "\"\(title)\" directed by \(director), \(duration) minutes"
        }
    }
    
    func isLong() -> Bool {
        switch self {
        case .book(_, _, let pages):
            return pages > 400
        case .movie(_, _, let duration):
            return duration > 120
        }
    }
}

let harryPotter = Item.book(title: "Harry Potter", author: "J.K. Rowling", pages: 500)
print(harryPotter.description())
// Output: "Harry Potter" by J.K. Rowling, 500 pages

print("Is it a long item? \(harryPotter.isLong())")
// Output: Is it a long item? true
```

## Real-World Applications

### Example 1: HTTP Request Methods

```swift
enum HTTPMethod {
    case get, post, put, delete
    
    func requiresBody() -> Bool {
        switch self {
        case .get, .delete:
            return false
        case .post, .put:
            return true
        }
    }
    
    func toString() -> String {
        switch self {
        case .get: return "GET"
        case .post: return "POST"
        case .put: return "PUT"
        case .delete: return "DELETE"
        }
    }
}

func makeRequest(to url: String, method: HTTPMethod, body: String? = nil) {
    print("Making \(method.toString()) request to \(url)")
    
    if method.requiresBody() {
        if let requestBody = body {
            print("Request body: \(requestBody)")
        } else {
            print("Error: This method requires a request body")
        }
    }
}

makeRequest(to: "https://api.example.com/users", method: .get)
// Output:
// Making GET request to https://api.example.com/users

makeRequest(to: "https://api.example.com/users", method: .post, body: "{\"name\": \"John\"}")
// Output:
// Making POST request to https://api.example.com/users
// Request body: {"name": "John"}
```

### Example 2: State Machine with Methods

```swift
enum TrafficLight {
    case red, yellow, green
    
    mutating func next() {
        switch self {
        case .red:
            self = .green
        case .yellow:
            self = .red
        case .green:
            self = .yellow
        }
    }
    
    func actionDescription() -> String {
        switch self {
        case .red:
            return "Stop!"
        case .yellow:
            return "Prepare to stop"
        case .green:
            return "Go!"
        }
    }
    
    func durationInSeconds() -> Int {
        switch self {
        case .red: return 30
        case .yellow: return 5
        case .green: return 45
        }
    }
}

var currentLight = TrafficLight.red
print("\(currentLight): \(currentLight.actionDescription()) for \(currentLight.durationInSeconds()) seconds")
// Output: red: Stop! for 30 seconds

currentLight.next()
print("\(currentLight): \(currentLight.actionDescription()) for \(currentLight.durationInSeconds()) seconds")
// Output: green: Go! for 45 seconds
```

## Summary

Methods in Swift enumerations provide a powerful way to add behavior directly to your enum types. By incorporating functionality within your enums, you can create more expressive, self-contained types that encapsulate both data and behavior.

Key points to remember:
- Regular instance methods operate on enum cases
- Use the `mutating` keyword for methods that change the enum's value
- Methods can access associated values in enum cases
- Static methods operate on the enum type rather than instances
- Enum methods follow the same syntax and capabilities as methods in structs and classes

By adding methods to your enumerations, you can create more expressive, maintainable, and powerful Swift code.

## Exercises

1. Create a `Coin` enum with cases `penny`, `nickel`, `dime`, and `quarter`. Add a method that returns the value in cents for each coin.

2. Design a `Weekday` enum with the days of the week. Add a method that returns whether the day is a weekday or weekend, and another method that returns the next day.

3. Create a `Shape` enum with cases for different geometric shapes (circle, rectangle, triangle). Include associated values for dimensions and add methods to calculate area and perimeter.

4. Implement a `PaymentMethod` enum with various payment options. Add methods that describe the processing time and fees for each method.

5. Design a `Result` enum with success and failure cases. Include associated values and methods to extract information from these cases safely.
