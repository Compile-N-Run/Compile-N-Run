# SQL TRUNCATE TABLE

## Introduction

When working with databases, you'll often need to remove all data from a table while keeping its structure intact. The `TRUNCATE TABLE` command provides an efficient way to accomplish this task. Unlike the `DELETE` command (which removes rows one by one), `TRUNCATE TABLE` removes all rows at once by deallocating the data pages, making it significantly faster for large tables.

In this tutorial, we'll explore the `TRUNCATE TABLE` statement, understand its syntax, behavior, and see examples of how and when to use it effectively.

## Basic Syntax

The basic syntax of the `TRUNCATE TABLE` command is straightforward:

```sql
TRUNCATE TABLE table_name;
```

Some database systems also allow a shorter version:

```sql
TRUNCATE table_name;
```

## How TRUNCATE Works vs DELETE

Before diving deeper, it's important to understand how `TRUNCATE TABLE` differs from `DELETE FROM table`:

| Feature | TRUNCATE TABLE | DELETE FROM |
|---------|----------------|-------------|
| Speed | Very fast (especially for large tables) | Slower (row-by-row deletion) |
| Transaction Log | Minimal logging | Fully logged |
| WHERE Clause | Not supported | Supported |
| Triggers | Doesn't activate triggers | Activates triggers |
| Identity/Auto-increment | Reset to seed value (typically 1) | Not reset |
| Rollback | Cannot be rolled back in most DBMSs | Can be rolled back |

## Basic Example

Let's see a simple example of how to truncate a table:

```sql
-- Create a sample table
CREATE TABLE employees (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    department VARCHAR(50),
    salary DECIMAL(10, 2)
);

-- Insert some sample data
INSERT INTO employees VALUES 
(1, 'John Doe', 'IT', 75000.00),
(2, 'Jane Smith', 'HR', 65000.00),
(3, 'Robert Brown', 'Marketing', 70000.00);

-- Check the data
SELECT * FROM employees;
```

Output:
```
id | name         | department | salary
---+--------------+------------+----------
1  | John Doe     | IT         | 75000.00
2  | Jane Smith   | HR         | 65000.00
3  | Robert Brown | Marketing  | 70000.00
```

Now, let's truncate the table:

```sql
-- Remove all data while keeping the table structure
TRUNCATE TABLE employees;

-- Check the data again
SELECT * FROM employees;
```

Output:
```
id | name | department | salary
---+------+------------+-------
(0 rows)
```

As you can see, all rows have been removed, but the table structure remains intact.

## TRUNCATE and Identity Columns

When a table has an identity column (auto-increment), `TRUNCATE TABLE` resets the counter to its initial value. This is different from `DELETE`, which continues from the last used value.

```sql
-- Create a table with an identity column
CREATE TABLE products (
    product_id INT IDENTITY(1,1) PRIMARY KEY,
    product_name VARCHAR(100),
    price DECIMAL(10, 2)
);

-- Insert some products
INSERT INTO products (product_name, price) VALUES 
('Laptop', 1200.00),
('Mouse', 25.00),
('Keyboard', 45.00);

-- Check the data
SELECT * FROM products;
```

Output:
```
product_id | product_name | price
-----------+--------------+--------
1          | Laptop       | 1200.00
2          | Mouse        | 25.00
3          | Keyboard     | 45.00
```

Now truncate and insert again:

```sql
-- Truncate the table
TRUNCATE TABLE products;

-- Insert a new product
INSERT INTO products (product_name, price) VALUES ('Monitor', 300.00);

-- Check the data
SELECT * FROM products;
```

Output:
```
product_id | product_name | price
-----------+--------------+--------
1          | Monitor      | 300.00
```

Notice that the `product_id` starts from 1 again after truncating.

## Limitations and Considerations

### Foreign Key Constraints

You cannot truncate a table that is referenced by a foreign key constraint. You must either:
1. Truncate the child tables first
2. Temporarily disable the foreign key constraints

Example of disabling constraints (in SQL Server):

```sql
-- Disable constraints
ALTER TABLE orders NOCHECK CONSTRAINT FK_orders_customers;

-- Truncate the table
TRUNCATE TABLE customers;

-- Re-enable constraints
ALTER TABLE orders CHECK CONSTRAINT FK_orders_customers;
```

### Permissions

`TRUNCATE TABLE` typically requires higher privileges (such as ALTER TABLE permissions) compared to DELETE. This is because it's considered a DDL (Data Definition Language) operation rather than a DML (Data Manipulation Language) operation.

### Database-Specific Behavior

The behavior of `TRUNCATE TABLE` can vary between different database management systems. For example:

- **MySQL**: Can be rolled back if used within a transaction with InnoDB tables
- **SQL Server**: Cannot be rolled back
- **PostgreSQL**: Can be used within a transaction and rolled back
- **Oracle**: Cannot be rolled back

## Real-World Applications

### 1. Development and Testing

During development and testing, you often need to reset tables to their initial state:

```sql
-- Reset test data
TRUNCATE TABLE test_orders;
TRUNCATE TABLE test_order_items;
TRUNCATE TABLE test_customers;

-- Now you can reload fresh test data
INSERT INTO test_customers VALUES (...);
```

### 2. Data Staging

When loading large amounts of data in a data warehouse or ETL process:

```sql
-- Empty staging table before loading new batch
TRUNCATE TABLE staging_daily_sales;

-- Now load today's data
INSERT INTO staging_daily_sales 
SELECT * FROM external_source_connection;
```

### 3. Log Rotation

Managing log tables that grow large over time:

```sql
-- Archive logs before truncating
INSERT INTO logs_archive 
SELECT * FROM application_logs 
WHERE log_date < DATEADD(month, -3, CURRENT_DATE);

-- Remove all logs from the active table
TRUNCATE TABLE application_logs;

-- Start fresh with new logs
```

## Common Errors and How to Resolve Them

### 1. Foreign Key Constraint Violations

Error:
```
Cannot truncate table 'customers' because it is being referenced by a FOREIGN KEY constraint.
```

Solution: Truncate the dependent tables first or temporarily disable constraints.

### 2. Permission Denied

Error:
```
The TRUNCATE TABLE permission was denied on object 'employees'.
```

Solution: Ensure you have appropriate permissions (usually ALTER TABLE rights) on the table.

### 3. Table Locked

Error:
```
Could not truncate table 'products' because it is currently in use.
```

Solution: Ensure no other transactions are using the table and no locks are being held.

## Summary

The `TRUNCATE TABLE` command is a powerful tool for efficiently removing all data from a table while preserving its structure. It's significantly faster than `DELETE` for large tables and resets identity columns. However, it comes with limitations, such as not being able to use a WHERE clause and potential issues with foreign key constraints.

Key points to remember:
- Use `TRUNCATE TABLE` when you need to remove all rows quickly
- Cannot be used with a WHERE clause to remove specific rows
- Resets identity columns to their seed values
- May not be possible on tables with foreign key references
- Behavior can vary between different database systems

## Exercises

1. Create a table called `practice_inventory` with columns for `item_id` (auto-increment), `item_name`, and `quantity`. Insert several records, truncate the table, and then insert a new record to observe the reset of the auto-increment value.

2. Try to truncate a table that is referenced by a foreign key and observe the error. Then, find a way to successfully truncate both tables.

3. Compare the execution time of `DELETE FROM large_table` vs. `TRUNCATE TABLE large_table` on a table with thousands of records.

4. Write a script that backs up data from a table to an archive table before truncating it.
