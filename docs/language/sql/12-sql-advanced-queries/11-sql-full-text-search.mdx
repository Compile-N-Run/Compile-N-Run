# SQL Full Text Search

## Introduction

Have you ever used a search engine or searched for a specific word within a document? Behind many of these search features lies a concept called **Full Text Search** - a powerful technique for searching through large text data efficiently.

SQL Full Text Search allows you to search for words, phrases, and variations of words within text columns in your database. Unlike regular `LIKE` or `REGEXP` operations, full-text search is optimized for performance when searching large volumes of text data and offers more intelligent matching capabilities.

In this tutorial, we'll explore how to implement and use full-text search in SQL databases, focusing primarily on MySQL and PostgreSQL implementations, as they're widely used by beginners.

## Why Use Full Text Search?

Before diving into implementation, let's understand why full-text search is superior to basic pattern matching:

1. **Performance**: Full-text search uses specialized indexes that make searching large text data much faster.
2. **Relevance**: Results can be ranked by relevance, showing the most likely matches first.
3. **Natural Language Processing**: Capabilities like stemming (finding variations of words) and stop words (ignoring common words like "the" or "and").
4. **Complex Queries**: Supports phrase matching, boolean operations, and proximity searches.

Let's compare a simple search using `LIKE` versus full-text search:

```sql
-- Using LIKE (slower for large datasets)
SELECT * FROM articles 
WHERE content LIKE '%database optimization%';

-- Using Full Text Search (faster and more powerful)
SELECT * FROM articles 
WHERE MATCH(content) AGAINST('database optimization' IN NATURAL LANGUAGE MODE);
```

## Full Text Search in MySQL

### Setting Up Full Text Search

In MySQL, you need to create a FULLTEXT index on the columns you want to search. You can do this when creating a table or by altering an existing table.

```sql
-- Creating a new table with FULLTEXT index
CREATE TABLE articles (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    title VARCHAR(255),
    content TEXT,
    FULLTEXT(title, content)
);

-- Adding FULLTEXT index to an existing table
ALTER TABLE articles
ADD FULLTEXT(title, content);
```

### Basic Full Text Search

Once you have a FULLTEXT index, you can perform searches using the `MATCH()` function combined with `AGAINST()`:

```sql
-- Basic natural language search
SELECT * FROM articles
WHERE MATCH(title, content) AGAINST('database optimization');
```

#### Example Input

Imagine we have the following data in our `articles` table:

| id | title                            | content                                                          |

| 3  | SQL Query Performance           | Tips for improving your database queries and optimization...      |

#### Example Output

The query `SELECT * FROM articles WHERE MATCH(title, content) AGAINST('database optimization');` would return:

| id | title                            | content                                                          |

| 3  | SQL Query Performance           | Tips for improving your database queries and optimization...      |

Notice that it returned both rows containing the words "database" and "optimization", even though the words might be in different columns or not directly next to each other.

### Search Modes in MySQL

MySQL offers different search modes for different requirements:

#### Natural Language Mode

This is the default mode and searches for words or phrases in a natural way:

```sql
SELECT *, MATCH(title, content) AGAINST('database optimization') AS score
FROM articles
WHERE MATCH(title, content) AGAINST('database optimization')
ORDER BY score DESC;
```

The query above also returns a relevance score and sorts results by relevance.

#### Boolean Mode

Boolean mode allows more complex queries with operators:

```sql
-- Find rows with "database" but not "SQL"
SELECT * FROM articles
WHERE MATCH(title, content) AGAINST('+database -SQL' IN BOOLEAN MODE);

-- Find exact phrase "database optimization"
SELECT * FROM articles
WHERE MATCH(title, content) AGAINST('"database optimization"' IN BOOLEAN MODE);
```

Common boolean operators:
- `+word`: Must contain this word
- `-word`: Must not contain this word
- `"phrase"`: Must contain this exact phrase
- `*`: Wildcard, e.g., `optimi*` matches "optimize", "optimizing", etc.
- `(` and `)`: Group expressions

## Full Text Search in PostgreSQL

PostgreSQL offers even more powerful full-text search capabilities with a dedicated text search engine.

### Setting Up Full Text Search

PostgreSQL uses vectors and specialized functions for full-text search:

```sql
-- Creating a table
CREATE TABLE articles (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    title VARCHAR(255),
    content TEXT
);

-- Adding a generated column for the search vector
ALTER TABLE articles 
ADD COLUMN search_vector tsvector GENERATED ALWAYS AS 
    (to_tsvector('english', title || ' ' || content)) STORED;

-- Creating an index on the search vector
CREATE INDEX articles_search_idx ON articles USING GIN (search_vector);
```

### Basic Full Text Search in PostgreSQL

```sql
-- Basic search
SELECT * FROM articles
WHERE search_vector @@ to_tsquery('english', 'database & optimization');
```

#### Example Input

With the same data as in our MySQL example:

| id | title                            | content                                                          |

| 3  | SQL Query Performance           | Tips for improving your database queries and optimization...      |

#### Example Output

The query would return:

| id | title                            | content                                                          |

### Advanced PostgreSQL Full Text Search

PostgreSQL offers additional powerful features:

#### Ranking Results

```sql
SELECT title, 
       ts_rank(search_vector, to_tsquery('english', 'database & optimization')) AS rank
FROM articles
WHERE search_vector @@ to_tsquery('english', 'database & optimization')
ORDER BY rank DESC;
```

#### Phrase Search

```sql
-- Search for a phrase
SELECT * FROM articles
WHERE search_vector @@ phraseto_tsquery('english', 'database optimization');
```

#### Highlighting Matches

```sql
SELECT title,
       ts_headline('english', content, to_tsquery('english', 'database'),
                   'StartSel=<b>, StopSel=</b>, MaxWords=50, MinWords=10')
FROM articles
WHERE search_vector @@ to_tsquery('english', 'database');
```

This will return content with matches highlighted in HTML bold tags.

## Real-World Application: Building a Blog Search Feature

Let's walk through building a simple blog post search feature:

### 1. Create and Set Up the Table

```sql
-- MySQL version
CREATE TABLE blog_posts (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    content TEXT NOT NULL,
    author VARCHAR(100),
    published_date DATE,
    FULLTEXT(title, content)
);

-- Insert some sample data
INSERT INTO blog_posts (title, content, author, published_date) VALUES
('Getting Started with SQL', 'SQL is a powerful language for working with relational databases...', 'Jane Smith', '2023-01-15'),
('Advanced Database Optimization', 'Learn techniques to optimize your database performance including indexing...', 'John Doe', '2023-02-20'),
('SQL vs NoSQL Databases', 'Comparing the differences between SQL and NoSQL database systems...', 'Jane Smith', '2023-03-10'),
('Database Security Best Practices', 'Protect your data with these essential database security measures...', 'Alex Johnson', '2023-04-05');
```

### 2. Implement the Search Functionality

```sql
-- Basic search query (MySQL)
SELECT 
    id, 
    title, 
    LEFT(content, 150) AS excerpt,
    author,
    published_date,
    MATCH(title, content) AGAINST(:searchTerm IN NATURAL LANGUAGE MODE) AS relevance
FROM 
    blog_posts
WHERE 
    MATCH(title, content) AGAINST(:searchTerm IN NATURAL LANGUAGE MODE)
ORDER BY 
    relevance DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### 3. Create a More Advanced Search Function

```sql
-- More complex search with filtering (MySQL)
SELECT 
    id, 
    title, 
    LEFT(content, 150) AS excerpt,
    author,
    published_date,
    MATCH(title, content) AGAINST(:searchTerm IN BOOLEAN MODE) AS relevance
FROM 
    blog_posts
WHERE 
    MATCH(title, content) AGAINST(:searchTerm IN BOOLEAN MODE)
    AND author = :authorName
    AND published_date BETWEEN :startDate AND :endDate
ORDER BY 
    relevance DESC, published_date DESC
LIMIT :resultLimit OFFSET :offset;
```

This query allows users to search for posts with specific terms, filter by author and date range, and implements pagination.

## Common Challenges and Solutions

### 1. Minimum Word Length

MySQL by default only indexes words with at least 3 characters. You can change this by modifying the `ft_min_word_len` system variable.

```sql
-- Check current setting
SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'ft_min_word_len';

-- To modify (requires server restart)
SET GLOBAL ft_min_word_len = 2;
```

After changing this, you'll need to rebuild your FULLTEXT indexes:

```sql
REPAIR TABLE articles QUICK;
```

### 2. Stop Words

Both MySQL and PostgreSQL ignore common words called "stop words" (like "the", "and", "or"). You can customize the stop word list if needed.

### 3. Special Characters and Accents

Full-text search may handle special characters and accents differently. Test thoroughly with your specific data.

```sql
-- Example of handling accents in PostgreSQL
SELECT to_tsvector('unaccent', 'café') @@ to_tsquery('unaccent', 'cafe');
```

## Performance Considerations

For optimal full-text search performance:

1. **Use the Right Indexes**: Full-text indexes can be large; only create them on necessary columns.
2. **Consider Column Size**: Searching smaller text columns is faster than large ones.
3. **Limit Result Sets**: Always use LIMIT to restrict the number of returned rows.
4. **Monitor Index Size**: Full-text indexes can be significantly larger than regular indexes.

```sql
-- Check index sizes in MySQL
SELECT
    table_name,
    index_name,
    stat_value * @@innodb_page_size as size_bytes
FROM
    mysql.innodb_index_stats
WHERE
    stat_name = 'size'
    AND index_name LIKE '%FT%'
ORDER BY
    size_bytes DESC;
```

## Summary

SQL Full Text Search provides powerful capabilities for efficiently searching text data in your databases. It offers significant advantages over simple pattern matching with `LIKE` operators, including better performance, relevance ranking, and more advanced search options.

Key takeaways:
1. Full-text search requires special indexes on the columns you want to search.
2. Different database systems implement full-text search differently (MySQL vs PostgreSQL).
3. You can perform simple word searches, exact phrase matches, and complex boolean searches.
4. Results can be ranked by relevance, allowing users to see the most important matches first.
5. Consider performance implications when implementing full-text search on large datasets.

## Exercises

1. Create a table with sample textual data and set up a full-text index.
2. Write a query that searches for a specific term and orders results by relevance.
3. Implement a boolean search query that finds records containing one term but not another.
4. Create a function that highlights matching terms in search results.
5. Build a simple search form that connects to your database and displays full-text search results.
