# C# Memory Allocation

When you write and run C# programs, memory allocation happens behind the scenes to store your data and objects. Understanding how C# allocates memory is crucial for writing efficient and bug-free applications, especially as your projects grow in complexity.

## Introduction to Memory Allocation

Memory allocation in C# involves two main regions:

1. **The Stack**: A region of memory that operates in a last-in-first-out (LIFO) manner
2. **The Heap**: A region of memory used for dynamic allocation

The way memory is allocated depends on the type of data you're working with. Let's dive into how this works.

## Value Types vs. Reference Types

### Value Types

Value types in C# are allocated on the stack and include:
- Primitive types (`int`, `float`, `char`, `bool`, etc.)
- Structs
- Enums

Value types contain their data directly and are typically fixed in size.

### Reference Types

Reference types in C# are allocated on the heap and include:
- Classes
- Arrays
- Delegates
- Interfaces
- Strings

Reference types store a reference (or address) to their data, not the actual data itself.

## Stack Allocation

The stack is a special region of memory that operates in a LIFO (Last In, First Out) manner. Memory allocation and deallocation on the stack happen automatically when variables go in and out of scope.

Let's see a simple example:

```csharp
void ExampleMethod()
{
    int x = 10;  // Allocated on the stack
    bool flag = true;  // Allocated on the stack
    
    // x and flag are automatically removed from the stack when the method ends
}
```

### Stack Allocation Characteristics

1. **Fast allocation/deallocation**: Adding or removing from the stack only requires updating the stack pointer
2. **Limited size**: The stack has a fixed size (usually a few MB per thread)
3. **Automatic cleanup**: Variables are automatically removed when they go out of scope
4. **Thread safety**: Each thread has its own stack

## Heap Allocation

The heap is used for dynamic memory allocation. Objects with unpredictable size or lifetime are stored on the heap.

```csharp
void HeapExample()
{
    // String is a reference type allocated on the heap
    string message = "Hello, World!";
    
    // Creating a new object - allocated on the heap
    Person person = new Person("John", 30);
    
    // The variables 'message' and 'person' themselves are references on the stack
    // that point to data on the heap
}

class Person
{
    public string Name;
    public int Age;
    
    public Person(string name, int age)
    {
        Name = name;
        Age = age;
    }
}
```

### Heap Allocation Characteristics

1. **Dynamic size**: The heap can grow as needed (limited by available memory)
2. **Complex allocation/deallocation**: Slower than stack operations
3. **Garbage Collection**: Memory is reclaimed by the garbage collector, not immediately after use
4. **Shared across threads**: One heap is shared among all threads

## How Objects Are Stored

Let's look at a more detailed example to understand how objects are stored:

```csharp
void StorageExample()
{
    // Value types stored on stack
    int count = 5;
    Point point = new Point(10, 20);  // Point is a struct
    
    // Reference types: reference on stack, data on heap
    string name = "Alice";
    List<int> numbers = new List<int> { 1, 2, 3 };
    
    // Complex example
    Person person = new Person("Bob", 25);
    person.Address = new Address("123 Main St");
}

struct Point
{
    public int X;
    public int Y;
    
    public Point(int x, int y)
    {
        X = x;
        Y = y;
    }
}

class Person
{
    public string Name;
    public int Age;
    public Address Address;
    
    public Person(string name, int age)
    {
        Name = name;
        Age = age;
    }
}

class Address
{
    public string Street;
    
    public Address(string street)
    {
        Street = street;
    }
}
```

In this example:
- `count` and `point` (including its X and Y fields) are stored directly on the stack
- For `name`, `numbers`, `person`, and `person.Address`, only references are stored on the stack, while the actual objects are on the heap

## Boxing and Unboxing

Boxing and unboxing are processes that convert between value types and reference types.

```csharp
// Boxing: Convert a value type to a reference type
int number = 42;
object boxed = number;  // Boxing - allocates memory on the heap

// Unboxing: Convert a reference type back to a value type
int unboxed = (int)boxed;  // Unboxing - retrieves the value
```

Boxing and unboxing operations can impact performance because they involve memory allocation and type conversions. It's best to avoid them in performance-critical code.

## Practical Example: Memory Usage in a Real Application

Let's look at a practical example of a simple task management application:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        // Create a task manager
        TaskManager manager = new TaskManager();
        
        // Add some tasks (allocates memory on heap for Task objects)
        manager.AddTask("Complete project proposal", Priority.High);
        manager.AddTask("Send emails", Priority.Medium);
        manager.AddTask("Update documentation", Priority.Low);
        
        // Display tasks
        manager.DisplayTasks();
        
        Console.WriteLine("\nCompleting a task...");
        manager.CompleteTask(1);
        
        // Display updated tasks
        manager.DisplayTasks();
    }
}

enum Priority
{
    Low,
    Medium,
    High
}

class Task
{
    public string Description { get; set; }
    public Priority Priority { get; set; }
    public bool IsCompleted { get; set; }
    
    public Task(string description, Priority priority)
    {
        Description = description;
        Priority = priority;
        IsCompleted = false;
    }
}

class TaskManager
{
    private List<Task> tasks;
    
    public TaskManager()
    {
        // Allocates a List<Task> on the heap
        tasks = new List<Task>();
    }
    
    public void AddTask(string description, Priority priority)
    {
        // Allocates a new Task object on the heap
        Task newTask = new Task(description, priority);
        tasks.Add(newTask);
    }
    
    public void CompleteTask(int index)
    {
        if (index >= 0 && index < tasks.Count)
        {
            tasks[index].IsCompleted = true;
        }
    }
    
    public void DisplayTasks()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("\nCurrent Tasks:");
        for (int i = 0; i < tasks.Count; i++)
        {
            string status = tasks[i].IsCompleted ? "[DONE]" : "[PENDING]";
            Console.WriteLine($"{i}. {status} {tasks[i].Description} ({tasks[i].Priority})");
        }
    }
}
```

Output:
```
Current Tasks:
0. [PENDING] Complete project proposal (High)
1. [PENDING] Send emails (Medium)
2. [PENDING] Update documentation (Low)

Completing a task...

Current Tasks:
0. [PENDING] Complete project proposal (High)
1. [DONE] Send emails (Medium)
2. [PENDING] Update documentation (Low)
```

In this example:

1. `Priority` enum values are stored on the stack when used as local variables
2. The `TaskManager` object is allocated on the heap
3. The `List<Task>` inside the manager is allocated on the heap
4. Each `Task` object is allocated on the heap
5. The `Description` string for each task is allocated on the heap

## Memory Allocation Best Practices

To write memory-efficient C# code:

1. **Reduce boxing and unboxing**: Use generics instead of object types when possible
2. **Be mindful of large value types**: Passing large structs by value can cause performance issues
3. **Use value types for small, simple data**: Prefer structs over classes for simple data structures
4. **Dispose of unmanaged resources**: Use the `IDisposable` pattern and `using` statements
5. **Limit object scope**: Create objects only when needed and allow them to be garbage collected when no longer needed
6. **Use object pooling**: For frequently created/disposed objects, consider implementing object pooling

## Summary

Memory allocation in C# happens in two primary memory regions:

- **Stack**: For value types and method execution context
- **Heap**: For reference types and dynamic memory allocation

Understanding how and where memory is allocated helps you write more efficient code and avoid common memory-related issues like excessive garbage collection, memory leaks, and performance bottlenecks.

The .NET Garbage Collector manages heap memory automatically, but knowing how memory allocation works allows you to write code that works better with the garbage collector rather than against it.

## Exercises

1. Create a small program that demonstrates stack overflow by using excessive recursion
2. Write a program that compares the performance of using value types versus reference types for a large collection of simple objects
3. Experiment with memory profiling tools like Visual Studio Memory Profiler to observe memory allocation in a simple application
4. Create a class that implements `IDisposable` and uses unmanaged resources properly
