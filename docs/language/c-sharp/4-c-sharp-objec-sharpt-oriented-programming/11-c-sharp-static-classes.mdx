# C# Static Classes

In C# object-oriented programming, static classes provide a special type of class that can't be instantiated and is designed to serve as a container for static members. Understanding static classes is essential for organizing utility methods and storing application-wide data.

## Introduction to Static Classes

A static class is a class that cannot be instantiated and can only contain static members. It serves as a container for methods that perform specific functions without requiring an object instance. Think of static classes as "toolboxes" that provide functionality you can access directly through the class name.

Key characteristics of static classes:
- Cannot be instantiated (no object creation with the `new` keyword)
- Cannot be used as a base class (cannot be inherited)
- Can only contain static members (methods, properties, fields, events)
- Cannot have instance constructors, but can have a static constructor
- Are implicitly sealed (cannot be inherited)

## Creating a Static Class

To create a static class in C#, you use the `static` keyword in the class declaration:

```csharp
public static class MathUtilities
{
    public static double SquareRoot(double number)
    {
        return Math.Sqrt(number);
    }
    
    public static int Add(int a, int b)
    {
        return a + b;
    }
}
```

## Accessing Members of a Static Class

To access members of a static class, you simply use the class name followed by the dot operator and the member name:

```csharp
// Using the static MathUtilities class
double result = MathUtilities.SquareRoot(16);
int sum = MathUtilities.Add(5, 3);

Console.WriteLine($"Square root of 16 is {result}"); // Output: Square root of 16 is 4
Console.WriteLine($"Sum of 5 and 3 is {sum}"); // Output: Sum of 5 and 3 is 8
```

## Static Constructors

A static class can have a static constructor that is called automatically before any static members are accessed for the first time:

```csharp
public static class ConfigurationManager
{
    public static string ConnectionString { get; private set; }
    public static string ApplicationName { get; private set; }
    
    // Static constructor
    static ConfigurationManager()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("ConfigurationManager initialized");
        ConnectionString = "Server=myServerAddress;Database=myDataBase;User Id=myUsername;Password=myPassword;";
        ApplicationName = "MyApplication";
    }
    
    public static void DisplayConfig()
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Application: {ApplicationName}");
        Console.WriteLine($"Connection: {ConnectionString}");
    }
}
```

When used:

```csharp
// First access to the static class will trigger the static constructor
ConfigurationManager.DisplayConfig();

/* Output:
ConfigurationManager initialized
Application: MyApplication
Connection: Server=myServerAddress;Database=myDataBase;User Id=myUsername;Password=myPassword;
*/
```

## Common Use Cases for Static Classes

### 1. Utility Classes

Static classes are perfect for utility methods that don't require object state:

```csharp
public static class StringUtils
{
    public static string Capitalize(string input)
    {
        if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(input))
            return input;
            
        return char.ToUpper(input[0]) + input.Substring(1);
    }
    
    public static bool IsPalindrome(string input)
    {
        if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(input))
            return true;
            
        string normalized = input.ToLower().Replace(" ", "");
        return normalized.SequenceEqual(normalized.Reverse());
    }
}
```

Usage example:

```csharp
string name = "john";
string capitalized = StringUtils.Capitalize(name);
Console.WriteLine(capitalized); // Output: John

bool isPalindrome = StringUtils.IsPalindrome("radar");
Console.WriteLine($"Is 'radar' a palindrome? {isPalindrome}"); // Output: Is 'radar' a palindrome? True
```

### 2. Extension Method Containers

Static classes are commonly used to define extension methods:

```csharp
public static class IntegerExtensions
{
    public static bool IsEven(this int number)
    {
        return number % 2 == 0;
    }
    
    public static bool IsPrime(this int number)
    {
        if (number <= 1) return false;
        if (number <= 3) return true;
        
        if (number % 2 == 0 || number % 3 == 0)
            return false;
            
        for (int i = 5; i * i <= number; i += 6)
        {
            if (number % i == 0 || number % (i + 2) == 0)
                return false;
        }
        
        return true;
    }
}
```

Usage example:

```csharp
int number = 7;
Console.WriteLine($"Is {number} even? {number.IsEven()}"); // Output: Is 7 even? False
Console.WriteLine($"Is {number} prime? {number.IsPrime()}"); // Output: Is 7 prime? True
```

### 3. Application-wide Constants and Settings

Static classes can store application-wide constants and settings:

```csharp
public static class AppSettings
{
    public static readonly string ApiBaseUrl = "https://api.example.com/v1";
    public static readonly int MaxRetryAttempts = 3;
    public static readonly TimeSpan RequestTimeout = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(30);
    
    public static string GetFullApiEndpoint(string endpointPath)
    {
        return $"{ApiBaseUrl}/{endpointPath.TrimStart('/')}";
    }
}
```

Usage example:

```csharp
// Access constants
Console.WriteLine($"API Base URL: {AppSettings.ApiBaseUrl}");
Console.WriteLine($"Max Retry Attempts: {AppSettings.MaxRetryAttempts}");

// Use helper methods that utilize constants
string usersEndpoint = AppSettings.GetFullApiEndpoint("/users");
Console.WriteLine($"Full Users API Endpoint: {usersEndpoint}"); // Output: Full Users API Endpoint: https://api.example.com/v1/users
```

## Static Classes vs. Non-Static Classes with Static Members

You might wonder why you would use a static class instead of a non-static class with static members. Here's a comparison:

```csharp
// Static class
public static class Calculator
{
    public static int Add(int a, int b) => a + b;
}

// Non-static class with static members
public class MathHelper
{
    public static int Multiply(int a, int b) => a * b;
    
    // Can also have instance members
    public int Subtract(int a, int b) => a - b;
}
```

Usage example:

```csharp
// Using static class
int sum = Calculator.Add(5, 3);
Console.WriteLine($"5 + 3 = {sum}"); // Output: 5 + 3 = 8

// Using static member of non-static class
int product = MathHelper.Multiply(5, 3);
Console.WriteLine($"5 * 3 = {product}"); // Output: 5 * 3 = 15

// Using instance member requires object creation
MathHelper helper = new MathHelper();
int difference = helper.Subtract(5, 3);
Console.WriteLine($"5 - 3 = {difference}"); // Output: 5 - 3 = 2
```

The key differences are:

1. Static classes can only contain static members
2. Non-static classes can have both static and instance members
3. Static classes cannot be instantiated
4. Static classes cannot be inherited from or inherit from other classes
5. Static classes are implicitly sealed

## Best Practices for Using Static Classes

1. **Use static classes for utility functions** that don't require object state

2. **Avoid static classes for storing mutable state** - they can create difficult-to-trace bugs in multi-threaded applications

3. **Consider dependency injection** instead of static classes for services in large applications to improve testability

4. **Group related functionality** - each static class should have a clear, focused purpose

5. **Use proper naming conventions** - static class names should clearly indicate their purpose (e.g., `StringUtils`, `MathHelper`)

## Real-World Example: Logger Implementation

Here's a simple logging utility implemented as a static class:

```csharp
public static class Logger
{
    private static readonly string LogFile = "application.log";
    
    static Logger()
    {
        // Initialize the log file with header
        File.WriteAllText(LogFile, $"=== Log started at {DateTime.Now} ===\n");
    }
    
    public static void Info(string message)
    {
        Log("INFO", message);
    }
    
    public static void Warning(string message)
    {
        Log("WARNING", message);
    }
    
    public static void Error(string message)
    {
        Log("ERROR", message);
    }
    
    public static void Error(Exception ex)
    {
        Log("ERROR", $"{ex.Message}\n{ex.StackTrace}");
    }
    
    private static void Log(string level, string message)
    {
        string logEntry = $"[{DateTime.Now}] [{level}] {message}\n";
        File.AppendAllText(LogFile, logEntry);
        Console.WriteLine(logEntry.TrimEnd());
    }
}
```

Usage in a real application:

```csharp
public class UserService
{
    public void CreateUser(string username)
    {
        Logger.Info($"Attempting to create user: {username}");
        
        try
        {
            // User creation logic here
            // ...
            
            Logger.Info($"User {username} created successfully");
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            Logger.Error($"Failed to create user: {username}");
            Logger.Error(ex);
            throw;
        }
    }
}

// Using the service
UserService service = new UserService();
service.CreateUser("johndoe");
```

## Summary

Static classes in C# are specialized classes that:

- Can't be instantiated (no object creation)
- Contain only static members
- Can't be used as a base class
- Are implicitly sealed
- Provide functionality that doesn't require object state

They are ideal for utility methods, extension method containers, and storing application-wide constants and configuration. However, they should be used with care as they can make code harder to test and maintain in complex applications.

## Exercises

1. Create a static class called `DateUtilities` with methods to calculate age from birthdate, determine if a date is a weekend, and format dates in various ways.

2. Implement a static class called `FileHelper` with methods to check if a file exists, get file size, and read the contents of a text file.

3. Create a static class called `Validator` with methods to validate email addresses, phone numbers, and passwords according to specific rules.

4. Design a static class for currency conversion that uses fixed exchange rates stored as static constants.
