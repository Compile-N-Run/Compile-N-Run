# C# Conditional Statements

In programming, we often need to execute different blocks of code based on certain conditions. This is where conditional statements come in. They allow our programs to make decisions and follow different paths of execution depending on whether specific conditions are true or false.

C# offers several ways to implement conditional logic:

- `if` statements
- `if-else` statements
- `else if` statements
- `switch` statements
- Ternary operator (`?:`)

Let's explore each of these with examples.

## The `if` Statement

The most basic conditional statement is the `if` statement. It executes a block of code only if a specified condition evaluates to `true`.

### Syntax

```csharp
if (condition)
{
    // Code to execute if condition is true
}
```

### Example

```csharp
int age = 20;

if (age >= 18)
{
    Console.WriteLine("You are an adult.");
}

// Output: You are an adult.
```

In this example, the message is displayed because the condition `age >= 18` evaluates to `true`.

## The `if-else` Statement

The `if-else` statement provides an alternative code block to execute when the condition is `false`.

### Syntax

```csharp
if (condition)
{
    // Code to execute if condition is true
}
else
{
    // Code to execute if condition is false
}
```

### Example

```csharp
int age = 15;

if (age >= 18)
{
    Console.WriteLine("You are an adult.");
}
else
{
    Console.WriteLine("You are a minor.");
}

// Output: You are a minor.
```

In this example, the second message is displayed because the condition `age >= 18` evaluates to `false`.

## The `else if` Statement

The `else if` statement allows you to check multiple conditions in sequence.

### Syntax

```csharp
if (condition1)
{
    // Code to execute if condition1 is true
}
else if (condition2)
{
    // Code to execute if condition2 is true
}
else
{
    // Code to execute if all conditions are false
}
```

### Example

```csharp
int score = 85;

if (score >= 90)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Grade: A");
}
else if (score >= 80)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Grade: B");
}
else if (score >= 70)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Grade: C");
}
else if (score >= 60)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Grade: D");
}
else
{
    Console.WriteLine("Grade: F");
}

// Output: Grade: B
```

In this example, the program checks the score against multiple ranges and assigns a grade accordingly.

## Nested `if` Statements

You can place `if` statements within other `if` statements to create more complex conditions.

### Example

```csharp
bool isLoggedIn = true;
bool isAdmin = false;

if (isLoggedIn)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Welcome to the system!");
    
    if (isAdmin)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("You have admin privileges.");
    }
    else
    {
        Console.WriteLine("You have limited access.");
    }
}
else
{
    Console.WriteLine("Please log in first.");
}

/* Output:
Welcome to the system!
You have limited access.
*/
```

## The `switch` Statement

The `switch` statement is useful when you need to compare a single expression against multiple possible values.

### Syntax

```csharp
switch (expression)
{
    case value1:
        // Code to execute if expression equals value1
        break;
    case value2:
        // Code to execute if expression equals value2
        break;
    // More cases...
    default:
        // Code to execute if expression doesn't match any case
        break;
}
```

### Example

```csharp
int dayOfWeek = 3;
string dayName;

switch (dayOfWeek)
{
    case 1:
        dayName = "Monday";
        break;
    case 2:
        dayName = "Tuesday";
        break;
    case 3:
        dayName = "Wednesday";
        break;
    case 4:
        dayName = "Thursday";
        break;
    case 5:
        dayName = "Friday";
        break;
    case 6:
        dayName = "Saturday";
        break;
    case 7:
        dayName = "Sunday";
        break;
    default:
        dayName = "Invalid day";
        break;
}

Console.WriteLine($"Day {dayOfWeek} is {dayName}");

// Output: Day 3 is Wednesday
```

### Switch Expressions (C# 8.0+)

C# 8.0 introduced a more concise syntax for switch statements called switch expressions.

```csharp
int dayOfWeek = 3;
string dayName = dayOfWeek switch
{
    1 => "Monday",
    2 => "Tuesday",
    3 => "Wednesday",
    4 => "Thursday",
    5 => "Friday",
    6 => "Saturday",
    7 => "Sunday",
    _ => "Invalid day" // The _ is the discard pattern for default
};

Console.WriteLine($"Day {dayOfWeek} is {dayName}");

// Output: Day 3 is Wednesday
```

## The Ternary Operator

The ternary operator provides a shorthand way to write an `if-else` statement in a single line of code.

### Syntax

```csharp
condition ? expression_if_true : expression_if_false
```

### Example

```csharp
int age = 20;
string message = (age >= 18) ? "You are an adult." : "You are a minor.";
Console.WriteLine(message);

// Output: You are an adult.
```

This does the same thing as the following `if-else` statement:

```csharp
string message;
if (age >= 18)
{
    message = "You are an adult.";
}
else
{
    message = "You are a minor.";
}
```

## Real-World Application: Simple Login System

Let's see how we can use conditional statements to create a simple login system:

```csharp
string storedUsername = "admin";
string storedPassword = "password123";

Console.WriteLine("=== Login System ===");
Console.Write("Username: ");
string enteredUsername = Console.ReadLine();

Console.Write("Password: ");
string enteredPassword = Console.ReadLine();

if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(enteredUsername) || string.IsNullOrEmpty(enteredPassword))
{
    Console.WriteLine("Error: Username and password cannot be empty.");
}
else if (enteredUsername == storedUsername && enteredPassword == storedPassword)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Login successful! Welcome, admin.");
    
    // Check admin level
    int adminLevel = 2;
    
    switch (adminLevel)
    {
        case 1:
            Console.WriteLine("You have basic admin rights.");
            break;
        case 2:
            Console.WriteLine("You have intermediate admin rights.");
            break;
        case 3:
            Console.WriteLine("You have full admin rights.");
            break;
        default:
            Console.WriteLine("Your admin level is undefined.");
            break;
    }
}
else
{
    Console.WriteLine("Login failed! Incorrect username or password.");
}

/* Sample Output (with correct credentials):
=== Login System ===
Username: admin
Password: password123
Login successful! Welcome, admin.
You have intermediate admin rights.
*/
```

## Real-World Application: Weather Advice Program

Here's another example that uses conditional statements to provide weather advice:

```csharp
Console.Write("Enter the current temperature in Celsius: ");
if (double.TryParse(Console.ReadLine(), out double temperature))
{
    Console.Write("Is it raining? (yes/no): ");
    string isRaining = Console.ReadLine().ToLower();

    Console.WriteLine("\nWeather Advice:");
    
    // Temperature advice
    if (temperature > 30)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("- It's very hot! Stay hydrated and try to stay in shade.");
    }
    else if (temperature > 20)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("- The temperature is pleasant. Enjoy your day!");
    }
    else if (temperature > 10)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("- It's a bit cool. Consider wearing a light jacket.");
    }
    else if (temperature > 0)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("- It's cold. Wear a warm coat.");
    }
    else
    {
        Console.WriteLine("- It's freezing! Wear warm layers and be careful of ice.");
    }
    
    // Rain advice
    if (isRaining == "yes")
    {
        string rainyAdvice = temperature < 0 
            ? "- It might be snowing instead of raining. Drive carefully!"
            : "- Don't forget to take an umbrella!";
        
        Console.WriteLine(rainyAdvice);
    }
}
else
{
    Console.WriteLine("Invalid temperature input!");
}

/* Sample Output:
Enter the current temperature in Celsius: 22
Is it raining? (yes/no): yes

Weather Advice:
- The temperature is pleasant. Enjoy your day!
- Don't forget to take an umbrella!
*/
```

## Summary

Conditional statements are essential for creating dynamic and responsive programs. In this tutorial, we covered:

- **`if` statements** for executing code when a condition is true
- **`if-else` statements** for providing alternative code when a condition is false
- **`else if` statements** for checking multiple conditions in sequence
- **`switch` statements** for comparing an expression against multiple possible values
- **Ternary operator** for writing simple if-else statements in a more concise way

By mastering these conditional statements, you can create programs that make decisions and respond differently based on varying inputs and conditions.
