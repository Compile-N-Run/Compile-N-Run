# C# While Loop

## Introduction

The `while` loop is one of the fundamental loop structures in C#. It allows you to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a specified condition evaluates to `true`. This is particularly useful when you don't know beforehand how many times you need to execute a code block.

Unlike a `for` loop which is often used when the number of iterations is known, a `while` loop is ideal for situations where the loop should continue until a certain condition is no longer valid.

## Basic Syntax

The syntax for a `while` loop in C# is:

```csharp
while (condition)
{
    // Code to be executed
}
```

The flow of execution is:

1. The condition is evaluated
2. If the condition is `true`, the code block is executed
3. After execution, the condition is evaluated again
4. Steps 2-3 repeat until the condition becomes `false`

## Simple While Loop Example

Let's start with a basic example that counts from 1 to 5:

```csharp
using System;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        int i = 1;
        
        while (i <= 5)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Count: {i}");
            i++;
        }
        
        Console.WriteLine("Loop finished!");
    }
}
```

Output:
```
Count: 1
Count: 2
Count: 3
Count: 4
Count: 5
Loop finished!
```

In this example:
- We initialize `i` with the value `1` before entering the loop
- The loop continues as long as `i` is less than or equal to `5`
- Inside the loop, we print the current value of `i` and then increment it
- Once `i` becomes `6`, the condition `i <= 5` becomes `false`, and the loop terminates

## Importance of Loop Control Variables

When using a `while` loop, it's crucial to make sure that:

1. The condition will eventually become `false` to avoid infinite loops
2. The condition variables are properly initialized before the loop
3. The condition variables are updated within the loop

If you forget to update the condition variable, you'll create an infinite loop:

```csharp
int i = 1;
while (i <= 5)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Count: {i}");
    // Forgot to increment i! This will cause an infinite loop
}
```

## Using While Loops with User Input

While loops are excellent for validating user input. Here's an example that asks the user to enter a positive number:

```csharp
using System;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        int number = -1;
        
        while (number <= 0)
        {
            Console.Write("Please enter a positive number: ");
            string input = Console.ReadLine();
            
            if (int.TryParse(input, out number))
            {
                if (number <= 0)
                {
                    Console.WriteLine("That's not a positive number. Try again.");
                }
            }
            else
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Invalid input. Please enter a number.");
                number = -1;
            }
        }
        
        Console.WriteLine($"Thank you! You entered: {number}");
    }
}
```

Example interaction:
```
Please enter a positive number: -5
That's not a positive number. Try again.
Please enter a positive number: zero
Invalid input. Please enter a number.
Please enter a positive number: 10
Thank you! You entered: 10
```

This example demonstrates how to use a `while` loop to repeatedly prompt the user until valid input is received.

## While vs. Do-While Loop

A variation of the `while` loop is the `do-while` loop. The key difference is that a `do-while` loop executes the code block at least once before checking the condition:

```csharp
// While loop - might not execute at all if condition is initially false
while (condition)
{
    // Code to be executed
}

// Do-while loop - always executes at least once
do
{
    // Code to be executed
} while (condition);
```

## Nested While Loops

Like other loop structures, `while` loops can be nested within each other:

```csharp
using System;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        int i = 1;
        
        while (i <= 3)
        {
            int j = 1;
            
            while (j <= 2)
            {
                Console.WriteLine($"i = {i}, j = {j}");
                j++;
            }
            
            i++;
            Console.WriteLine("--------");
        }
    }
}
```

Output:
```
i = 1, j = 1
i = 1, j = 2
--------
i = 2, j = 1
i = 2, j = 2
--------
i = 3, j = 1
i = 3, j = 2
--------
```

## Practical Example: Simple Number Guessing Game

Now let's create a more practical example - a number guessing game:

```csharp
using System;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        Random random = new Random();
        int secretNumber = random.Next(1, 101); // Random number between 1 and 100
        int guess = 0;
        int attempts = 0;
        bool hasWon = false;
        
        Console.WriteLine("Welcome to the Number Guessing Game!");
        Console.WriteLine("I've selected a number between 1 and 100.");
        
        while (!hasWon && attempts < 7)
        {
            Console.Write("Enter your guess: ");
            string input = Console.ReadLine();
            
            if (int.TryParse(input, out guess))
            {
                attempts++;
                
                if (guess < secretNumber)
                {
                    Console.WriteLine("Too low! Try again.");
                }
                else if (guess > secretNumber)
                {
                    Console.WriteLine("Too high! Try again.");
                }
                else
                {
                    hasWon = true;
                    Console.WriteLine($"Congratulations! You guessed the number {secretNumber} in {attempts} attempts!");
                }
            }
            else
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Invalid input. Please enter a number.");
            }
            
            Console.WriteLine($"Attempts left: {7 - attempts}");
        }
        
        if (!hasWon)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Sorry, you've used all your attempts. The secret number was {secretNumber}.");
        }
    }
}
```

This example showcases a complete game that:
- Generates a random number
- Uses a while loop to give the player multiple attempts
- Provides feedback after each guess
- Tracks and limits the number of attempts
- Handles invalid input

## Breaking Out of While Loops

Sometimes you need to exit a loop early based on a specific condition. You can use the `break` statement for this:

```csharp
using System;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        int i = 1;
        
        while (i <= 10)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Number: {i}");
            
            // Exit the loop when i reaches 5
            if (i == 5)
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Breaking out of the loop!");
                break;
            }
            
            i++;
        }
        
        Console.WriteLine("Loop terminated");
    }
}
```

Output:
```
Number: 1
Number: 2
Number: 3
Number: 4
Number: 5
Breaking out of the loop!
Loop terminated
```

## Skipping Iterations with Continue

You can also use the `continue` statement to skip the current iteration and proceed with the next one:

```csharp
using System;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        int i = 0;
        
        while (i < 10)
        {
            i++;
            
            // Skip printing even numbers
            if (i % 2 == 0)
            {
                continue;
            }
            
            Console.WriteLine($"Odd number: {i}");
        }
    }
}
```

Output:
```
Odd number: 1
Odd number: 3
Odd number: 5
Odd number: 7
Odd number: 9
```

## Common Pitfalls

### 1. Infinite Loops

The most common error when working with while loops is creating an infinite loop by forgetting to update the condition variable:

```csharp
// Infinite loop - i is never updated
int i = 1;
while (i <= 5)
{
    Console.WriteLine(i);
    // Missing i++ statement!
}
```

### 2. Off-by-One Errors

Be careful about the boundary conditions in your loops:

```csharp
// Will run from 1 to 5 (inclusive)
int i = 1;
while (i <= 5)
{
    Console.WriteLine(i);
    i++;
}

// Will run from 1 to 4 (exclusive of 5)
int j = 1;
while (j < 5)
{
    Console.WriteLine(j);
    j++;
}
```

### 3. Condition Evaluation Timing

Remember that the condition is evaluated at the beginning of each iteration:

```csharp
int x = 10;
while (x > 0)
{
    Console.WriteLine(x);
    x -= 2;
}
// Outputs: 10, 8, 6, 4, 2
```

## Performance Considerations

While loops are efficient for situations where the number of iterations is unknown beforehand. However, if you know exactly how many iterations you need, a `for` loop might be more appropriate and clearer to read.

## Summary

The `while` loop in C# is a powerful tool that allows you to:

- Execute code repeatedly as long as a specified condition is true
- Handle situations where the number of iterations isn't known beforehand
- Process user input until valid data is entered
- Create interactive programs like simple games
- Control loop execution with `break` and `continue` statements

When using while loops, always ensure that:
- The loop condition will eventually become false
- The condition variables are properly initialized and updated
- You avoid common pitfalls like infinite loops
- You choose the right loop structure for your specific use case

## Exercises

1. Write a program that calculates the sum of all integers from 1 to n, where n is entered by the user.

2. Create a program that prints the first 10 numbers in the Fibonacci sequence using a while loop.

3. Write a program that reverses a number entered by the user (e.g., input 123 should output 321).

4. Create a simple calculator program that keeps asking the user for operations until they enter 'q' to quit.

5. Implement a "high-low" guessing game where the computer has to guess a number that the user thinks of.
