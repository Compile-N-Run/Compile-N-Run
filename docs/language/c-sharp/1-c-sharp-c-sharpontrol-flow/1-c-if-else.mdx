# C# If Else Statements

## Introduction

Decision making is an essential part of programming. In real life, we make decisions based on certain conditions, and computer programs work similarly. C# provides several decision-making statements that execute different blocks of code based on specified conditions.

The `if-else` statement is one of the fundamental control flow structures in C#. It allows your program to make decisions and execute different code paths depending on whether a specified condition evaluates to `true` or `false`.

## Basic If Statement

The simplest form of conditional execution is the `if` statement. It executes a block of code only when a specified condition is true.

### Syntax

```csharp
if (condition)
{
    // Code to execute if the condition is true
}
```

### Example

```csharp
int temperature = 28;

if (temperature > 25)
{
    Console.WriteLine("It's a hot day!");
}

// Output: It's a hot day!
```

In this example, the message is displayed because the temperature (28) is greater than 25.

## If-Else Statement

The `if-else` statement extends the `if` statement by providing an alternative block of code to execute when the condition is false.

### Syntax

```csharp
if (condition)
{
    // Code to execute if the condition is true
}
else
{
    // Code to execute if the condition is false
}
```

### Example

```csharp
int hour = 20;

if (hour < 18)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Good day!");
}
else
{
    Console.WriteLine("Good evening!");
}

// Output: Good evening!
```

In this example, since the hour (20) is not less than 18, the program executes the code in the `else` block.

## Multiple Conditions with Else If

When you need to check multiple conditions, you can use the `else if` construct, which allows you to specify additional conditions to test if the previous condition was false.

### Syntax

```csharp
if (condition1)
{
    // Code to execute if condition1 is true
}
else if (condition2)
{
    // Code to execute if condition1 is false and condition2 is true
}
else if (condition3)
{
    // Code to execute if condition1 and condition2 are false and condition3 is true
}
else
{
    // Code to execute if all conditions are false
}
```

### Example

```csharp
int score = 85;

if (score >= 90)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Grade: A");
}
else if (score >= 80)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Grade: B");
}
else if (score >= 70)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Grade: C");
}
else if (score >= 60)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Grade: D");
}
else
{
    Console.WriteLine("Grade: F");
}

// Output: Grade: B
```

In this example, the program checks the score against different ranges and assigns a grade accordingly. Since the score is 85, it falls in the B range.

## Nested If Statements

You can also place an `if` statement inside another `if` statement, creating what's known as a nested `if` statement.

### Example

```csharp
bool isWeekend = true;
bool isRaining = true;

if (isWeekend)
{
    if (isRaining)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Stay home and watch a movie");
    }
    else
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Go out and enjoy the weekend");
    }
}
else
{
    Console.WriteLine("It's a workday");
}

// Output: Stay home and watch a movie
```

In this example, the program first checks if it's a weekend. Since it is, it then checks if it's raining. As it is raining, it suggests staying home.

## Logical Operators in Conditions

C# provides logical operators (`&&` for AND, `||` for OR, `!` for NOT) that you can use to combine multiple conditions in a single `if` statement.

### Example

```csharp
int age = 25;
bool hasLicense = true;

if (age >= 18 && hasLicense)
{
    Console.WriteLine("You can drive a car");
}
else if (age >= 18 && !hasLicense)
{
    Console.WriteLine("You need to get a license first");
}
else
{
    Console.WriteLine("You are too young to drive");
}

// Output: You can drive a car
```

In this example, both conditions (age >= 18 AND hasLicense is true) must be true for the first code block to execute.

## The Conditional (Ternary) Operator

C# provides a shorthand for simple `if-else` statements known as the conditional operator or the ternary operator.

### Syntax

```csharp
condition ? expression_if_true : expression_if_false
```

### Example

```csharp
int age = 20;
string status = (age >= 18) ? "Adult" : "Minor";
Console.WriteLine($"Status: {status}");

// Output: Status: Adult
```

This example checks if the age is 18 or older. If it is, the status is set to "Adult"; otherwise, it's set to "Minor".

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: User Authentication

```csharp
string storedUsername = "user123";
string storedPassword = "pass123";

string inputUsername = "user123";
string inputPassword = "pass123";

if (inputUsername == storedUsername)
{
    if (inputPassword == storedPassword)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Login successful!");
    }
    else
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Incorrect password!");
    }
}
else
{
    Console.WriteLine("Username not found!");
}

// Output: Login successful!
```

### Example 2: Weather App Suggestion

```csharp
int temperature = 28;
bool isRaining = false;

if (temperature > 30)
{
    Console.WriteLine("It's very hot outside!");
    if (isRaining)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Unusual weather: Hot and rainy!");
    }
}
else if (temperature > 20)
{
    if (isRaining)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Take an umbrella, it's warm but rainy.");
    }
    else
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Nice weather for a walk!");
    }
}
else if (temperature > 10)
{
    Console.WriteLine("It's a bit cool outside.");
}
else
{
    Console.WriteLine("It's cold, wear a jacket!");
}

// Output: Nice weather for a walk!
```

### Example 3: Discount Calculator

```csharp
double totalPurchase = 120.50;
bool isMember = true;
string couponCode = "SAVE10";

double discount = 0;

if (totalPurchase >= 100)
{
    discount += 5; // 5% discount for purchases over $100
    
    if (isMember)
    {
        discount += 10; // Additional 10% discount for members
    }
    
    if (couponCode == "SAVE10")
    {
        discount += 10; // Additional 10% for valid coupon code
    }
}
else if (totalPurchase >= 50)
{
    discount += 2; // 2% discount for purchases over $50
    
    if (isMember)
    {
        discount += 5; // Additional 5% discount for members
    }
}

double finalPrice = totalPurchase * (1 - discount / 100);
Console.WriteLine($"Total purchase: ${totalPurchase}");
Console.WriteLine($"Discount applied: {discount}%");
Console.WriteLine($"Final price: ${finalPrice:F2}");

/* Output:
Total purchase: $120.5
Discount applied: 25%
Final price: $90.38
*/
```

## Best Practices

1. **Keep conditions simple**: Try to keep your conditions as simple and readable as possible.

2. **Use braces**: Always use braces `{}` even for single-line statements to improve readability and prevent errors.

3. **Be careful with equality checks**: Use `==` for equality comparison, not `=` which is for assignment.

4. **Avoid deep nesting**: If you find yourself nesting many levels deep, consider refactoring your code.

5. **Watch for null values**: When working with objects, check for nulls to avoid NullReferenceExceptions.

```csharp
string name = null;

// Bad practice - might cause a NullReferenceException
if (name.Length > 0) { }

// Good practice - check for null first
if (name != null && name.Length > 0) { }

// Even better in modern C# - use the null conditional operator
if (name?.Length > 0) { }
```

## Summary

Conditional statements are fundamental to programming as they enable your code to make decisions. In C#, the primary conditional construct is the `if-else` statement, which can be extended with `else if` for multiple conditions. For simple conditionals, the ternary operator provides a concise alternative.

Remember that conditionals evaluate expressions to Boolean values (`true` or `false`), and you can combine multiple conditions using logical operators (`&&`, `||`, `!`).

By mastering conditionals, you gain the ability to create more dynamic and responsive applications that can adapt to various situations and user inputs.

## Exercises

1. Write a program that takes a user's age as input and outputs different messages based on age ranges (child, teenager, adult, senior).

2. Create a simple calculator that takes two numbers and an operation (+, -, *, /) as input and performs the appropriate calculation using if-else statements.

3. Write a program that checks if a year is a leap year. (Hint: A leap year is divisible by 4, but not by 100 unless it's also divisible by 400).

4. Create a program that determines the shipping cost based on the purchase amount and destination (local, domestic, international).
