# C# Do While Loop

## Introduction

The `do-while` loop is a fundamental control flow structure in C# that allows you to execute a block of code repeatedly based on a condition. What makes the `do-while` loop special is that it **always executes the code block at least once** before checking the condition. This is different from other loops like the `while` loop, which checks the condition first before executing any code.

In this tutorial, you'll learn:
- How the `do-while` loop works
- When to use a `do-while` loop instead of other loops
- Practical examples and applications
- Common pitfalls and how to avoid them

## Syntax

Here's the basic syntax of a `do-while` loop:

```csharp
do
{
    // Code to be executed
} while (condition);
```

The loop will:
1. Execute the code block first
2. Then check the condition
3. If the condition is `true`, it will repeat step 1
4. If the condition is `false`, it will exit the loop

## Basic Example

Let's start with a simple example that counts from 1 to 5:

```csharp
using System;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        int counter = 1;
        
        do
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Count: {counter}");
            counter++;
        } while (counter <= 5);
        
        Console.WriteLine("Loop finished!");
    }
}
```

**Output:**
```
Count: 1
Count: 2
Count: 3
Count: 4
Count: 5
Loop finished!
```

### How It Works

1. We initialize a counter variable with value 1
2. The `do` block executes, printing the current count and incrementing the counter
3. After executing the block, the condition `counter <= 5` is checked
4. As long as the condition remains true, the loop continues
5. When `counter` becomes 6, the condition becomes false, and the loop ends

## Do While vs. While Loop

The key difference between `do-while` and `while` is when the condition is evaluated:

```csharp
// do-while: executes at least once
int x = 10;
do
{
    Console.WriteLine($"do-while: x = {x}");
    x--;
} while (x > 0);

// while: may never execute if condition is initially false
int y = 10;
while (y > 0)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"while: y = {y}");
    y--;
}
```

### When the Condition is Initially False

```csharp
int number = 5;

// This will execute once even though the condition is false
do
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Do-while executed: {number}");
    number++;
} while (number < 5);

// Reset number
number = 5;

// This won't execute at all because the condition is checked first
while (number < 5)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"While executed: {number}");
    number++;
}
```

**Output:**
```
Do-while executed: 5
```

Notice that only the do-while block executed, because the while loop checked the condition first and found it false.

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: User Input Validation

The `do-while` loop is perfect for scenarios where you want to ensure that users provide valid input:

```csharp
using System;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        int userNumber;
        
        do
        {
            Console.Write("Please enter a positive number: ");
            string input = Console.ReadLine();
            
            if (int.TryParse(input, out userNumber) && userNumber > 0)
            {
                // Valid input, exit loop
                break;
            }
            
            Console.WriteLine("Invalid input! Try again.");
            
        } while (true);
        
        Console.WriteLine($"Thank you! You entered: {userNumber}");
    }
}
```

In this example, the loop continues until the user provides a valid positive number.

### Example 2: Menu System

A common real-world application is creating a menu system:

```csharp
using System;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        int choice;
        
        do
        {
            Console.WriteLine("\n=== Menu ===");
            Console.WriteLine("1. View Profile");
            Console.WriteLine("2. Edit Settings");
            Console.WriteLine("3. Play Game");
            Console.WriteLine("4. Exit");
            Console.Write("Enter your choice (1-4): ");
            
            if (int.TryParse(Console.ReadLine(), out choice))
            {
                switch (choice)
                {
                    case 1:
                        Console.WriteLine("Loading profile...");
                        break;
                    case 2:
                        Console.WriteLine("Opening settings...");
                        break;
                    case 3:
                        Console.WriteLine("Starting game...");
                        break;
                    case 4:
                        Console.WriteLine("Goodbye!");
                        break;
                    default:
                        Console.WriteLine("Invalid option! Please select 1-4.");
                        break;
                }
            }
            else
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Please enter a valid number!");
                choice = 0; // Reset choice
            }
            
        } while (choice != 4); // Continue loop until Exit option is selected
    }
}
```

This menu system keeps showing options until the user selects the exit option.

### Example 3: Processing File Data

The `do-while` loop can be useful when reading data until you reach the end of a file:

```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        string line;
        int lineCount = 0;
        
        try
        {
            StreamReader file = new StreamReader("sample.txt");
            
            do
            {
                line = file.ReadLine();
                
                if (line != null)
                {
                    lineCount++;
                    Console.WriteLine($"Line {lineCount}: {line}");
                }
                
            } while (line != null);
            
            file.Close();
            Console.WriteLine($"\nTotal lines: {lineCount}");
        }
        catch (FileNotFoundException)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("File not found!");
        }
    }
}
```

## Common Pitfalls and Best Practices

### 1. Infinite Loops

Be careful not to create infinite loops. Always ensure that your condition will eventually become `false`:

```csharp
// Potential infinite loop if you forget to update counter
do
{
    Console.WriteLine("This might never end!");
    // Missing: counter++; 
} while (counter < 10);
```

### 2. Condition Variables

Make sure that variables used in your condition are properly updated within the loop:

```csharp
int x = 5;
do
{
    Console.WriteLine($"x = {x}");
    x--; // Important: without this, the loop would be infinite
} while (x > 0);
```

### 3. Scope of Variables

Variables declared within the `do` block are not accessible in the `while` condition:

```csharp
do
{
    int count = 5; // Local to this block
    Console.WriteLine(count);
} while (count > 0); // Error! 'count' doesn't exist in this scope
```

The correct approach is to define the variables before the loop:

```csharp
int count = 5;
do
{
    Console.WriteLine(count);
    count--;
} while (count > 0);
```

## When to Use Do While vs. Other Loops

Use a `do-while` loop when:
- You need to execute a block of code at least once before checking a condition
- Validating user input (as shown in examples)
- Creating menu systems that should display at least once
- Processing data where you need to read before checking for end conditions

Use a regular `while` loop when:
- You might want to skip execution entirely based on an initial condition
- The number of iterations is unknown but depends on a condition

Use a `for` loop when:
- The number of iterations is known or can be calculated
- You need more structured loop components (initialization, condition, iteration)

## Summary

The `do-while` loop is a powerful construct in C# that guarantees at least one execution of a code block before checking a condition. This makes it particularly useful for:

- User input validation
- Menu-based interfaces
- Scenarios where code must run at least once

Remember these key points:
- The loop body always executes at least once
- The condition is checked after the loop body executes
- Be careful to avoid infinite loops by ensuring your condition will eventually become false

By understanding and correctly implementing `do-while` loops, you'll have another valuable tool in your C# programming toolkit.

## Exercises

To solidify your knowledge, try these exercises:

1. Create a guessing game where the user tries to guess a random number between 1 and 100, giving them hints if their guess is too high or too low.

2. Write a program that calculates the average of a series of numbers entered by the user. Use a `do-while` loop to keep asking for numbers until the user enters a negative number.

3. Implement a simple calculator program using a `do-while` loop that keeps performing operations until the user chooses to exit.
