# C# Loops

Loops are fundamental programming constructs that allow you to execute a block of code repeatedly. In C#, loops are essential for tasks like processing collections of data, implementing repetitive calculations, or executing code until a specific condition is met.

## Introduction to Loops

In programming, we often need to perform the same action multiple times. Instead of writing the same code over and over again, we use loops to repeat actions. C# provides several types of loops, each with its own use cases:

- `for` loops: Used when you know exactly how many times you want to loop
- `foreach` loops: Designed for iterating over collections like arrays and lists
- `while` loops: Execute as long as a condition remains true
- `do-while` loops: Similar to while loops but guarantee at least one execution

Let's explore each type of loop in detail.

## The `for` Loop

The `for` loop is one of the most common loops in C#. It's particularly useful when you know the exact number of iterations needed.

### Syntax

```csharp
for (initialization; condition; iteration)
{
    // Code to be executed
}
```

The `for` loop consists of three parts:
1. **Initialization**: Executed once at the beginning
2. **Condition**: Checked before each iteration; the loop continues as long as it's true
3. **Iteration**: Executed after each iteration

### Example: Counting from 1 to 5

```csharp
using System;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Count: {i}");
        }
    }
}
```

**Output:**
```
Count: 1
Count: 2
Count: 3
Count: 4
Count: 5
```

In this example:
- `int i = 1` initializes the counter variable
- `i <= 5` sets the condition to continue looping
- `i++` increments the counter after each iteration

### Practical Application: Calculating Factorial

```csharp
using System;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        int number = 5;
        int factorial = 1;
        
        for (int i = 1; i <= number; i++)
        {
            factorial *= i;
        }
        
        Console.WriteLine($"The factorial of {number} is: {factorial}");
    }
}
```

**Output:**
```
The factorial of 5 is: 120
```

## The `foreach` Loop

The `foreach` loop is designed specifically for iterating through collections like arrays, lists, and other enumerable objects.

### Syntax

```csharp
foreach (type item in collection)
{
    // Code to be executed for each item
}
```

### Example: Iterating Through an Array

```csharp
using System;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        string[] fruits = { "Apple", "Banana", "Cherry", "Date", "Elderberry" };
        
        foreach (string fruit in fruits)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Current fruit: {fruit}");
        }
    }
}
```

**Output:**
```
Current fruit: Apple
Current fruit: Banana
Current fruit: Cherry
Current fruit: Date
Current fruit: Elderberry
```

Unlike the `for` loop, `foreach` doesn't require you to manage indexes or check boundaries, making your code cleaner and less prone to errors when working with collections.

### Practical Application: Calculating Average of Scores

```csharp
using System;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        int[] scores = { 85, 92, 78, 95, 88 };
        int sum = 0;
        
        foreach (int score in scores)
        {
            sum += score;
        }
        
        double average = (double)sum / scores.Length;
        Console.WriteLine($"The average score is: {average}");
    }
}
```

**Output:**
```
The average score is: 87.6
```

## The `while` Loop

The `while` loop executes a block of code as long as a specified condition is true. It checks the condition before each iteration.

### Syntax

```csharp
while (condition)
{
    // Code to be executed
}
```

### Example: Counting Down from 5

```csharp
using System;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        int countdown = 5;
        
        while (countdown > 0)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Countdown: {countdown}");
            countdown--;
        }
        
        Console.WriteLine("Blast off!");
    }
}
```

**Output:**
```
Countdown: 5
Countdown: 4
Countdown: 3
Countdown: 2
Countdown: 1
Blast off!
```

The `while` loop is particularly useful when you don't know in advance how many iterations you'll need.

### Practical Application: Reading User Input Until a Condition

```csharp
using System;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        string input = "";
        
        while (input != "exit")
        {
            Console.Write("Enter a command (type 'exit' to quit): ");
            input = Console.ReadLine();
            Console.WriteLine($"You entered: {input}");
        }
        
        Console.WriteLine("Program terminated.");
    }
}
```

**Output (example interaction):**
```
Enter a command (type 'exit' to quit): hello
You entered: hello
Enter a command (type 'exit' to quit): C#
You entered: C#
Enter a command (type 'exit' to quit): exit
You entered: exit
Program terminated.
```

## The `do-while` Loop

The `do-while` loop is similar to the `while` loop, with one key difference: it checks the condition after the code block executes, guaranteeing at least one execution of the code.

### Syntax

```csharp
do
{
    // Code to be executed
} while (condition);
```

### Example: Basic `do-while` Loop

```csharp
using System;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        int i = 1;
        
        do
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Iteration: {i}");
            i++;
        } while (i <= 5);
    }
}
```

**Output:**
```
Iteration: 1
Iteration: 2
Iteration: 3
Iteration: 4
Iteration: 5
```

### Practical Application: Input Validation

```csharp
using System;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        int number;
        
        do
        {
            Console.Write("Enter a positive number: ");
            number = Convert.ToInt32(Console.ReadLine());
            
            if (number <= 0)
            {
                Console.WriteLine("That's not a positive number. Please try again.");
            }
        } while (number <= 0);
        
        Console.WriteLine($"You entered the positive number: {number}");
    }
}
```

**Output (example interaction):**
```
Enter a positive number: -5
That's not a positive number. Please try again.
Enter a positive number: 0
That's not a positive number. Please try again.
Enter a positive number: 10
You entered the positive number: 10
```

## Control Statements in Loops

C# provides special statements to alter the normal flow of loops:

### `break` Statement

The `break` statement immediately exits the loop, regardless of the condition.

```csharp
using System;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++)
        {
            if (i == 6)
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Breaking the loop at i = 6");
                break;
            }
            Console.WriteLine($"Current value: {i}");
        }
        Console.WriteLine("Loop finished");
    }
}
```

**Output:**
```
Current value: 1
Current value: 2
Current value: 3
Current value: 4
Current value: 5
Breaking the loop at i = 6
Loop finished
```

### `continue` Statement

The `continue` statement skips the current iteration and moves to the next one.

```csharp
using System;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++)
        {
            if (i == 3)
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Skipping iteration for i = 3");
                continue;
            }
            Console.WriteLine($"Current value: {i}");
        }
    }
}
```

**Output:**
```
Current value: 1
Current value: 2
Skipping iteration for i = 3
Current value: 4
Current value: 5
```

## Nested Loops

You can place loops inside other loops, creating nested loops. This is useful for working with multi-dimensional data structures.

```csharp
using System;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        int rows = 3;
        int columns = 4;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < rows; i++)
        {
            for (int j = 0; j < columns; j++)
            {
                Console.Write($"({i},{j}) ");
            }
            Console.WriteLine(); // Move to the next line after each row
        }
    }
}
```

**Output:**
```
(0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) 
(1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) 
(2,0) (2,1) (2,2) (2,3) 
```

### Practical Application: Printing a Pattern

```csharp
using System;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        int rows = 5;
        
        for (int i = 1; i <= rows; i++)
        {
            for (int j = 1; j <= i; j++)
            {
                Console.Write("* ");
            }
            Console.WriteLine();
        }
    }
}
```

**Output:**
```
* 
* * 
* * * 
* * * * 
* * * * * 
```

## Infinite Loops

Sometimes we need a loop to run indefinitely until an explicit break condition. This is called an infinite loop.

```csharp
using System;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        int count = 0;
        
        while (true)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Iteration: {count}");
            count++;
            
            if (count >= 5)
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Breaking out of the infinite loop");
                break;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

**Output:**
```
Iteration: 0
Iteration: 1
Iteration: 2
Iteration: 3
Iteration: 4
Breaking out of the infinite loop
```

Be careful with infinite loops! Always ensure there's a way to exit the loop.

## Summary

Loops are powerful constructs in C# that allow you to execute code repeatedly based on specific conditions:

- **`for` loops**: Best when you know the exact number of iterations needed
- **`foreach` loops**: Ideal for iterating through collections like arrays and lists
- **`while` loops**: Perfect when you need to continue execution until a condition becomes false
- **`do-while` loops**: Similar to while loops but guarantees at least one execution

Choosing the right loop depends on your specific requirements:
- Use `for` when you need precise control over the iteration process
- Use `foreach` for clean and safe iteration through collections
- Use `while` when the number of iterations is indeterminate
- Use `do-while` when you need to guarantee at least one execution

Understanding loops and how to control them with `break` and `continue` statements is essential for writing efficient C# programs.
