# C# Code Organization

Good code organization is one of the most important aspects of software development. Well-organized code is easier to read, maintain, debug, and collaborate on. In this guide, we'll explore best practices for organizing your C# code that will help you become a more effective developer.

## Why Code Organization Matters

Before diving into specific techniques, it's important to understand why code organization matters:

- **Readability**: Well-organized code is easier to read and understand
- **Maintainability**: Structured code is easier to update and modify
- **Debugging**: Finding and fixing bugs becomes simpler
- **Collaboration**: Other developers can work with your code more effectively
- **Scalability**: Good organization helps projects scale without becoming unwieldy

## File and Directory Structure

### Project Structure

A typical C# solution should have a logical structure:

```
MySolution/
├── MySolution.Core/           (Core business logic)
├── MySolution.Data/           (Data access layer)
├── MySolution.API/            (API endpoints)
├── MySolution.UI/             (User interface)
├── MySolution.Tests/          (Test projects)
└── MySolution.Common/         (Shared utilities)
```

Each project should have a single responsibility, following the separation of concerns principle.

### File Organization

Within each project, organize files logically:

```
MyProject/
├── Controllers/               (API controllers)
├── Models/                    (Data models)
├── Services/                  (Business logic services)
├── Repositories/              (Data access)
├── Helpers/                   (Utility classes)
└── Extensions/                (Extension methods)
```

## Namespace Organization

Namespaces should reflect your project structure. For example:

```csharp
namespace MySolution.Core.Services
{
    public class OrderService
    {
        // Implementation
    }
}

namespace MySolution.Data.Repositories
{
    public class OrderRepository
    {
        // Implementation
    }
}
```

## Class Structure

### Using Regions (With Caution)

Regions can help organize different sections of code within a class, but shouldn't be used to hide complexity:

```csharp
public class Customer
{
    #region Properties
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public string Email { get; set; }
    #endregion

    #region Constructors
    public Customer() { }
    
    public Customer(string name, string email)
    {
        Name = name;
        Email = email;
    }
    #endregion

    #region Methods
    public bool Validate()
    {
        // Validation logic
        return !string.IsNullOrEmpty(Name) && !string.IsNullOrEmpty(Email);
    }
    #endregion
}
```

### Standard Class Member Order

Follow a consistent order for members within a class:

1. Constants
2. Fields
3. Properties
4. Constructors
5. Methods
6. Nested types

Example:

```csharp
public class Product
{
    // Constants
    public const int MaxNameLength = 100;
    
    // Fields
    private decimal _price;
    private readonly IProductRepository _repository;
    
    // Properties
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
    
    public decimal Price
    {
        get => _price;
        set
        {
            if (value < 0)
                throw new ArgumentException("Price cannot be negative");
            _price = value;
        }
    }
    
    // Constructors
    public Product(IProductRepository repository)
    {
        _repository = repository ?? throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(repository));
    }
    
    // Methods
    public void Save()
    {
        _repository.SaveProduct(this);
    }
    
    // Nested types
    public enum ProductStatus
    {
        Active,
        Discontinued
    }
}
```

## Code File Organization

### Single Responsibility Files

Each file should contain a single class, interface, or enum that follows the Single Responsibility Principle:

```csharp
// UserService.cs
public class UserService
{
    // User-related functionality only
}

// EmailService.cs
public class EmailService
{
    // Email-related functionality only
}
```

### Partial Classes

Use partial classes to split large classes into multiple files when appropriate:

```csharp
// Customer.cs
public partial class Customer
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public string Email { get; set; }
    
    // Core customer properties and methods
}

// Customer.Validation.cs
public partial class Customer
{
    // Validation-specific methods
    public bool Validate()
    {
        return ValidateName() && ValidateEmail();
    }
    
    private bool ValidateName()
    {
        return !string.IsNullOrEmpty(Name);
    }
    
    private bool ValidateEmail()
    {
        return !string.IsNullOrEmpty(Email) && Email.Contains("@");
    }
}
```

## Practical Example: E-Commerce System

Let's see how these principles apply in a real-world e-commerce application:

```csharp
// Project: ECommerce.Core
// File: Models/Order.cs
namespace ECommerce.Core.Models
{
    public class Order
    {
        public int Id { get; set; }
        public Customer Customer { get; set; }
        public List<OrderItem> Items { get; set; } = new List<OrderItem>();
        public DateTime OrderDate { get; set; }
        public OrderStatus Status { get; set; }
        
        public decimal TotalAmount => Items.Sum(i => i.Quantity * i.UnitPrice);
        
        public void AddItem(Product product, int quantity)
        {
            if (product == null)
                throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(product));
                
            if (quantity <= 0)
                throw new ArgumentException("Quantity must be positive", nameof(quantity));
                
            var existingItem = Items.FirstOrDefault(i => i.ProductId == product.Id);
            
            if (existingItem != null)
                existingItem.Quantity += quantity;
            else
                Items.Add(new OrderItem { ProductId = product.Id, UnitPrice = product.Price, Quantity = quantity });
        }
    }
    
    public enum OrderStatus
    {
        New,
        Processing,
        Shipped,
        Delivered,
        Cancelled
    }
}

// File: Services/OrderService.cs
namespace ECommerce.Core.Services
{
    public class OrderService : IOrderService
    {
        private readonly IOrderRepository _orderRepository;
        private readonly IEmailService _emailService;
        
        public OrderService(IOrderRepository orderRepository, IEmailService emailService)
        {
            _orderRepository = orderRepository;
            _emailService = emailService;
        }
        
        public async Task<int> CreateOrderAsync(Order order)
        {
            // Validate order
            if (order.Items.Count == 0)
                throw new BusinessException("Order must contain at least one item");
                
            // Save to database
            var orderId = await _orderRepository.AddAsync(order);
            
            // Send confirmation email
            await _emailService.SendOrderConfirmationAsync(order);
            
            return orderId;
        }
        
        public async Task<Order> GetOrderByIdAsync(int id)
        {
            return await _orderRepository.GetByIdAsync(id);
        }
    }
}
```

## Key Tips for Better Code Organization

1. **Be consistent** - Follow the same patterns throughout your codebase
2. **Use descriptive names** - Classes, methods, and variables should be clearly named
3. **Group related items** - Keep related code together and unrelated code separate
4. **Keep files and methods small** - Aim for methods that are 20 lines or less
5. **Use dependency injection** - To manage dependencies and improve testability
6. **Follow SOLID principles** - Especially Single Responsibility and Interface Segregation

## Common Anti-Patterns to Avoid

1. **God classes** - Large classes that try to do too much
2. **Deep nesting** - More than 3 levels of nesting makes code hard to read
3. **Excessive comments** - If you need too many comments, your code may need restructuring
4. **Long parameter lists** - Consider parameter objects for methods with many parameters
5. **Public fields** - Use properties instead of public fields
6. **Magic numbers/strings** - Use named constants instead

## Summary

Good C# code organization is about creating a logical structure that makes your code easy to understand and maintain. By following the practices outlined in this guide, you can write cleaner, more maintainable code that you and your team will enjoy working with.

Remember that organization is not just about aesthetics; it's about creating code that communicates its intent clearly and can evolve with changing requirements.
