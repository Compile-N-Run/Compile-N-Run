# C# Exception Handling in Asynchronous Programming

## Introduction

When working with asynchronous code in C#, proper exception handling becomes even more critical than in synchronous code. Asynchronous operations often execute on different threads or at different times, making it challenging to trace and handle errors effectively. This guide will walk you through the essentials of exception handling in asynchronous C# programming, ensuring your applications remain robust even when the unexpected happens.

Exception handling in asynchronous code has some unique challenges and patterns that differ from traditional synchronous error handling. Understanding these differences is crucial for writing reliable asynchronous applications.

## Basic Exception Handling in C#

Before diving into asynchronous exception handling, let's review the fundamental exception handling mechanism in C#:

```csharp
try
{
    // Code that might throw an exception
    int result = 10 / 0; // This will throw a DivideByZeroException
}
catch (DivideByZeroException ex)
{
    // Handle specific exception
    Console.WriteLine($"Specific error caught: {ex.Message}");
}
catch (Exception ex)
{
    // Handle any other exceptions
    Console.WriteLine($"General error caught: {ex.Message}");
}
finally
{
    // Code that will always execute, whether an exception occurred or not
    Console.WriteLine("This will always execute");
}
```

Output:
```
Specific error caught: Attempted to divide by zero.
This will always execute
```

## Exception Handling in Async Methods

When dealing with `async` methods, exception handling gets more complex. Let's look at how exceptions propagate in asynchronous code:

### Awaiting Exceptions

When you use the `await` keyword, exceptions from the awaited task are automatically propagated to the calling method:

```csharp
public async Task DivideAsync()
{
    try
    {
        await Task.Run(() =>
        {
            // This exception will be caught by the try/catch block
            throw new InvalidOperationException("Async operation failed");
        });
    }
    catch (InvalidOperationException ex)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Caught async exception: {ex.Message}");
    }
}
```

Output when calling `await DivideAsync()`:
```
Caught async exception: Async operation failed
```

### Unhandled Exceptions in Async Methods

If an exception is thrown in an async method and not caught, it gets stored in the returned `Task`. The exception will be thrown when the task is awaited:

```csharp
public async Task ThrowExceptionAsync()
{
    await Task.Delay(100); // Simulate some work
    throw new ApplicationException("Something went wrong");
    // This exception is stored in the Task
}

public async Task CallerMethodAsync()
{
    try
    {
        await ThrowExceptionAsync(); // Exception will be thrown here when awaited
    }
    catch (ApplicationException ex)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Caught at caller: {ex.Message}");
    }
}
```

Output when calling `await CallerMethodAsync()`:
```
Caught at caller: Something went wrong
```

## Common Pitfalls in Async Exception Handling

### Fire-and-Forget Without Handling

One common mistake is calling an async method without awaiting it and not handling its exceptions:

```csharp
// PROBLEMATIC CODE - Don't do this!
public void FireAndForgetProblem()
{
    // This exception will be lost or might crash the application
    ThrowExceptionAsync();  // Not awaited!
}
```

If `ThrowExceptionAsync()` throws an exception, it will be stored in the returned Task but never observed, potentially causing your application to crash or behave unexpectedly.

### Better Approach:

```csharp
public void FireAndForgetSafer()
{
    // Create a continuation that handles any errors
    Task.Run(async () => 
    {
        try
        {
            await ThrowExceptionAsync();
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            // Log the exception
            Console.WriteLine($"Background task failed: {ex.Message}");
        }
    });
}
```

## Using Try-Catch with Task-based Asynchronous Pattern

### Handling Multiple Tasks

When working with multiple tasks, you can handle exceptions from each individually:

```csharp
public async Task HandleMultipleTasksAsync()
{
    try
    {
        Task task1 = Task.Run(() => { throw new ArgumentException("Task 1 failed"); });
        Task task2 = Task.Run(() => { throw new FormatException("Task 2 failed"); });
        
        await Task.WhenAll(task1, task2);
    }
    catch (Exception ex)
    {
        // This will only catch the first exception
        Console.WriteLine($"Caught exception: {ex.Message}");
        
        // To get all exceptions when using Task.WhenAll:
        if (ex is AggregateException aggEx)
        {
            foreach (var innerEx in aggEx.InnerExceptions)
            {
                Console.WriteLine($"Inner exception: {innerEx.Message}");
            }
        }
    }
}
```

To properly handle all exceptions from `Task.WhenAll()`:

```csharp
public async Task HandleAllExceptionsAsync()
{
    Task task1 = Task.Run(() => { throw new ArgumentException("Task 1 failed"); });
    Task task2 = Task.Run(() => { throw new FormatException("Task 2 failed"); });
    
    // Store the task so we can examine it even if it fails
    Task allTasks = Task.WhenAll(task1, task2);
    
    try
    {
        await allTasks;
    }
    catch
    {
        // We caught an exception, but now we can examine all of them
        if (allTasks.Exception != null)
        {
            foreach (var ex in allTasks.Exception.InnerExceptions)
            {
                Console.WriteLine($"Task failed with: {ex.Message}");
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Output:
```
Task failed with: Task 1 failed
Task failed with: Task 2 failed
```

## Real-World Example: Handling API Request Exceptions

Let's look at a practical example of handling exceptions in a web API client:

```csharp
public class WeatherApiClient
{
    private readonly HttpClient _httpClient;
    private readonly ILogger _logger;
    
    public WeatherApiClient(HttpClient httpClient, ILogger logger)
    {
        _httpClient = httpClient;
        _logger = logger;
    }
    
    public async Task<WeatherData> GetWeatherDataAsync(string city)
    {
        try
        {
            var response = await _httpClient.GetAsync($"api/weather/{city}");
            
            // Check if the request was successful
            if (response.IsSuccessStatusCode)
            {
                string json = await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();
                return JsonSerializer.Deserialize<WeatherData>(json);
            }
            else if (response.StatusCode == HttpStatusCode.NotFound)
            {
                // City wasn't found - this is a "business logic" exception
                throw new CityNotFoundException($"Weather data for {city} not found.");
            }
            else
            {
                // Server returned an error
                throw new HttpRequestException(
                    $"Weather API returned status code: {(int)response.StatusCode}",
                    null,
                    statusCode: response.StatusCode);
            }
        }
        catch (HttpRequestException ex)
        {
            _logger.LogError(ex, $"HTTP error while getting weather data for {city}");
            throw; // Re-throw to let the caller handle it
        }
        catch (JsonException ex)
        {
            _logger.LogError(ex, $"JSON parsing error for weather data from {city}");
            throw new WeatherDataParseException($"Could not parse weather data for {city}", ex);
        }
        catch (OperationCanceledException ex)
        {
            _logger.LogWarning(ex, $"Weather API request for {city} was canceled");
            throw; // Re-throw cancellation
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            _logger.LogError(ex, $"Unexpected error getting weather data for {city}");
            throw new WeatherServiceException("An unexpected error occurred", ex);
        }
    }
}

// Usage:
public async Task DisplayWeatherAsync(string city)
{
    try
    {
        var weatherClient = new WeatherApiClient(new HttpClient(), logger);
        var weatherData = await weatherClient.GetWeatherDataAsync(city);
        Console.WriteLine($"Temperature in {city}: {weatherData.Temperature}Â°C");
    }
    catch (CityNotFoundException)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Sorry, we don't have data for {city}");
    }
    catch (WeatherDataParseException)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Sorry, we received corrupt data from our weather service");
    }
    catch (WeatherServiceException)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Our weather service is currently unavailable. Please try again later.");
    }
}
```

This example demonstrates:
1. Handling different types of exceptions in a real-world scenario
2. Adding contextual information to exceptions
3. Logging exceptions before re-throwing them
4. Using custom exception types to provide meaningful information
5. Proper exception handling hierarchy from specific to general

## Best Practices for Async Exception Handling

1. **Always await tasks**: Never ignore returned tasks from async methods without handling potential exceptions.

2. **Use specific exception types**: Catch specific exceptions before general ones to provide better error handling.

3. **Avoid empty catch blocks**: Always do something meaningful in catch blocks, even if it's just logging.

4. **Wrap third-party code**: Wrap calls to external libraries in try-catch blocks to translate exceptions into your application's domain.

5. **Use exception filters when appropriate**:
```csharp
try
{
    await SomeAsyncOperation();
}
catch (HttpRequestException ex) when (ex.StatusCode == HttpStatusCode.NotFound)
{
    // Handle 404 specifically
}
catch (HttpRequestException ex)
{
    // Handle other HTTP errors
}
```

6. **Consider retries for transient failures**:
```csharp
public async Task<string> GetDataWithRetryAsync()
{
    int retryCount = 0;
    int maxRetries = 3;
    TimeSpan delay = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(1);
    
    while (true)
    {
        try
        {
            return await FetchDataAsync();
        }
        catch (HttpRequestException ex) when (IsTransient(ex) && retryCount < maxRetries)
        {
            retryCount++;
            await Task.Delay(delay);
            delay = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(Math.Pow(2, retryCount)); // Exponential backoff
        }
    }
}

private bool IsTransient(HttpRequestException ex)
{
    // Check if the exception represents a temporary failure
    // e.g., timeout, server too busy, etc.
    return ex.StatusCode == HttpStatusCode.ServiceUnavailable || 
           ex.StatusCode == HttpStatusCode.GatewayTimeout;
}
```

## Summary

Effective exception handling in asynchronous C# code requires understanding how exceptions flow through async/await operations. By using proper try-catch blocks, handling task exceptions correctly, and applying best practices, you can create robust applications that degrade gracefully when errors occur.

Remember these key points:
- Exceptions in async methods are captured in the returned Task
- Use await to let exceptions propagate naturally
- Always handle exceptions in fire-and-forget scenarios
- Use Task.WhenAll carefully and extract all exceptions when needed
- Create specific exception types for better error handling
- Log exceptions with adequate context information

## Exercises

1. **Basic Exception Handling**: Create an async method that throws an exception after a delay and properly handle it in the calling method.

2. **Multiple Tasks**: Write a program that starts three async operations that might fail and handle all possible exceptions.

3. **Retry Logic**: Implement a retry mechanism for a web API call that handles transient failures with exponential backoff.

4. **Custom Exceptions**: Create a library that uses custom exception types for different error scenarios in async operations.

5. **Cancellation**: Modify the weather service example to support cancellation and properly handle cancellation exceptions.
