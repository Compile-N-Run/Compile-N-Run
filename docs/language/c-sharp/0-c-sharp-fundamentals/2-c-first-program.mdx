# C# First Program

## Introduction

Welcome to the exciting world of C# programming! In this tutorial, we'll create your very first C# program - the classic "Hello World" application. This simple program serves as the traditional starting point for learning any programming language and will help you understand the basic structure of C# applications.

By the end of this guide, you'll have written, compiled, and executed your first C# program, and you'll understand each component that makes it work.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have:
- [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) installed on your computer
- A code editor (Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, or any text editor)

## Creating Your First C# Program

### Step 1: Setting Up Your Project

Let's start by creating a new console application. If you're using Visual Studio, you can:
1. Open Visual Studio
2. Select "Create a new project"
3. Choose "Console App (.NET Core)" or "Console App (.NET)"
4. Name your project "HelloWorld"

If you prefer using the command line:

```bash
dotnet new console -n HelloWorld
cd HelloWorld
```

### Step 2: Understanding the Generated Code

Open the `Program.cs` file. Depending on your .NET version, you'll see one of these two versions:

**For .NET 5 and earlier:**

```csharp
using System;

namespace HelloWorld
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
        }
    }
}
```

**For .NET 6 and newer:**

```csharp
// See https://aka.ms/new-console-template for more information
Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
```

Let's stick with the more explicit first version for better understanding.

### Step 3: Analyzing the Code Structure

Let's break down the components of our program:

1. **Using Directive**:
   ```csharp
   using System;
   ```
   This line tells the compiler that we're using the `System` namespace, which contains fundamental classes like `Console`.

2. **Namespace Declaration**:
   ```csharp
   namespace HelloWorld
   {
       // Code here
   }
   ```
   Namespaces organize code and prevent naming conflicts. Here, our code belongs to the `HelloWorld` namespace.

3. **Class Declaration**:
   ```csharp
   class Program
   {
       // Methods here
   }
   ```
   In C#, code is organized into classes. `Program` is the main class of our application.

4. **Main Method**:
   ```csharp
   static void Main(string[] args)
   {
       // Code to execute
   }
   ```
   Every C# console application needs a `Main` method. It's the entry point - the first code that runs when your program starts.
   - `static`: The method belongs to the class itself, not to instances of the class
   - `void`: The method doesn't return any value
   - `Main`: The name of the method (must be spelled exactly like this)
   - `string[] args`: Command-line arguments passed to the program

5. **Program Logic**:
   ```csharp
   Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
   ```
   This line prints "Hello World!" to the console window. `Console` is a class, and `WriteLine` is a method that outputs text followed by a new line.

### Step 4: Running Your Program

To run your program:

- In Visual Studio: Press F5 or click "Start Debugging"
- In the command line: Type `dotnet run`

**Output:**
```
Hello World!
```

Congratulations! You've just created and run your first C# program.

## Modifying Your First Program

Let's make our program a bit more interactive:

```csharp
using System;

namespace HelloWorld
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            // Prompt the user for their name
            Console.Write("Please enter your name: ");
            
            // Read the user's input
            string name = Console.ReadLine();
            
            // Display a personalized greeting
            Console.WriteLine($"Hello, {name}! Welcome to the world of C#!");
            
            // Wait for a key press before closing
            Console.WriteLine("Press any key to exit...");
            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
}
```

**Example Interaction:**
```
Please enter your name: Sarah
Hello, Sarah! Welcome to the world of C#!
Press any key to exit...
```

### Explanation of New Elements:

1. `Console.Write()`: Similar to `WriteLine()` but doesn't add a new line after the text
2. `Console.ReadLine()`: Reads a line of text from the console
3. `string name`: Declares a variable that stores the user's input
4. `$"Hello, {name}!"`: String interpolation - a convenient way to insert variable values into strings
5. `Console.ReadKey()`: Waits for the user to press a key before continuing

## Practical Application: Simple Calculator

Let's build a simple calculator to demonstrate how you can create useful programs right from the start:

```csharp
using System;

namespace SimpleCalculator
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Simple Calculator");
            Console.WriteLine("-----------------");
            
            // Get first number
            Console.Write("Enter first number: ");
            double num1 = Convert.ToDouble(Console.ReadLine());
            
            // Get second number
            Console.Write("Enter second number: ");
            double num2 = Convert.ToDouble(Console.ReadLine());
            
            // Display results of operations
            Console.WriteLine($"{num1} + {num2} = {num1 + num2}");
            Console.WriteLine($"{num1} - {num2} = {num1 - num2}");
            Console.WriteLine($"{num1} * {num2} = {num1 * num2}");
            
            // Handle division by zero
            if (num2 != 0)
            {
                Console.WriteLine($"{num1} / {num2} = {num1 / num2}");
            }
            else
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Cannot divide by zero.");
            }
            
            Console.WriteLine("\nPress any key to exit...");
            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
}
```

**Example Interaction:**
```
Simple Calculator
-----------------
Enter first number: 10
Enter second number: 5
10 + 5 = 15
10 - 5 = 5
10 * 5 = 50
10 / 5 = 2

Press any key to exit...
```

This calculator demonstrates several important concepts:
- Getting user input and converting it to appropriate data types
- Performing basic arithmetic operations
- Implementing basic logic with if/else statements
- Formatting output for readability

## Common Errors and Troubleshooting

When writing your first C# programs, you might encounter these common issues:

1. **Syntax Errors**: Missing semicolons, brackets, or typos in keywords
   ```csharp
   Console.WriteLine("Hello World")  // Missing semicolon
   ```

2. **Runtime Errors**: Issues that occur when the program runs
   ```csharp
   // This will crash if the user enters non-numeric text
   int number = Convert.ToInt32(Console.ReadLine());
   ```

3. **Logic Errors**: The program runs but produces incorrect results
   ```csharp
   // Intended to add, but using wrong operator
   int result = 5 * 10;  // Gives 50 instead of 15
   ```
