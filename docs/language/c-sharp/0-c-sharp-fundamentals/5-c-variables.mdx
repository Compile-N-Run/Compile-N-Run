# C# Variables

## Introduction

Variables are fundamental building blocks in any programming language, including C#. They act as containers that store data in a program's memory, allowing you to save, retrieve, and manipulate information while your application runs. In C#, variables are strongly typed, which means that each variable has a specific data type that determines what kind of data it can hold.

In this tutorial, we'll explore how variables work in C#, how to declare and initialize them, naming conventions, and best practices to follow when working with variables.

## What are Variables?

A variable is essentially a name given to a memory location where data is stored. Think of variables as labeled boxes where you can put different types of information. In C#, each variable has:

- A **name** that you use to reference it
- A **data type** that defines what kind of data it can store
- A **value** that represents the actual data stored

## Declaring Variables in C#

To create a variable in C#, you need to declare it by specifying its data type and name. The basic syntax is:

```csharp
dataType variableName;
```

For example, to declare an integer variable named `age`:

```csharp
int age;
```

You can also initialize a variable (give it a value) when you declare it:

```csharp
int age = 25;
```

Let's look at some examples of variable declarations with different data types:

```csharp
// Numeric types
int count = 10;           // Integer
double price = 15.99;     // Double-precision floating point
float temperature = 98.6f; // Single-precision floating point
decimal money = 100.50m;  // Decimal (note the 'm' suffix)

// Text type
string name = "John Doe";  // String of characters

// Single character type
char grade = 'A';          // Single character (note the single quotes)

// Boolean type
bool isActive = true;      // Boolean (true or false)

// Date and time
DateTime today = DateTime.Now; // Current date and time
```

## Example: Using Variables

Let's see a complete example of declaring variables and using them:

```csharp
using System;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        // Declaring variables
        string studentName = "Maria Garcia";
        int studentAge = 22;
        double studentGPA = 3.8;
        bool isEnrolled = true;
        
        // Using variables in output
        Console.WriteLine("Student Information:");
        Console.WriteLine("------------------");
        Console.WriteLine($"Name: {studentName}");
        Console.WriteLine($"Age: {studentAge}");
        Console.WriteLine($"GPA: {studentGPA}");
        Console.WriteLine($"Currently Enrolled: {isEnrolled}");
    }
}
```

Output:
```
Student Information:
------------------
Name: Maria Garcia
Age: 22
GPA: 3.8
Currently Enrolled: True
```

## Variable Declaration Options

### Multiple Variable Declaration

You can declare multiple variables of the same type in a single statement:

```csharp
int x = 10, y = 20, z = 30;
```

### Implicitly Typed Variables

C# allows you to use the `var` keyword to declare variables without explicitly stating their type. The compiler infers the type from the initializer:

```csharp
var message = "Hello World"; // Compiler infers string type
var number = 42;             // Compiler infers int type
var price = 9.99;            // Compiler infers double type
```

Note: When using `var`, you must initialize the variable in the same statement since the compiler needs the initializer to determine the type.

## Variable Naming Conventions in C#

Following proper naming conventions makes your code more readable and maintainable:

1. Use **camelCase** for local variables and parameters (e.g., `firstName`, `totalAmount`)
2. Start with a letter or underscore (not a number)
3. Use descriptive names that indicate the purpose of the variable
4. Avoid reserved keywords and abbreviations
5. Don't use Hungarian notation (prefixing variable names with type information)

Good variable names:
```csharp
int age;
string firstName;
double taxRate;
bool isComplete;
```

Poor variable names:
```csharp
int a;            // Not descriptive
string str1;      // Not descriptive
double d;         // Not descriptive
bool b;           // Not descriptive
string strName;   // Hungarian notation (avoid)
```

## Variable Scope

The scope of a variable determines where in your code the variable can be accessed:

### Block Scope

Variables declared within code blocks (enclosed in `{}`) are accessible only within that block:

```csharp
void ExampleMethod()
{
    // This variable is accessible throughout the method
    int outerVariable = 10;
    
    if (outerVariable > 5)
    {
        // This variable is only accessible within this if block
        int innerVariable = 20;
        
        Console.WriteLine(outerVariable);    // Works fine
        Console.WriteLine(innerVariable);    // Works fine
    }
    
    Console.WriteLine(outerVariable);        // Works fine
    // Console.WriteLine(innerVariable);     // Error! Not accessible here
}
```

### Method-Level Variables (Local Variables)

Variables declared within a method are only accessible within that method:

```csharp
void MethodOne()
{
    int localVariable = 10;    // Only accessible in MethodOne
    Console.WriteLine(localVariable);
}

void MethodTwo()
{
    // Console.WriteLine(localVariable);    // Error! Not accessible here
}
```

### Class-Level Variables (Fields)

Variables declared at the class level are accessible throughout the class (depending on their access modifiers):

```csharp
class Student
{
    // Class-level variable (field)
    private string name;
    
    public void SetName(string studentName)
    {
        name = studentName;    // Can access the field
    }
    
    public void DisplayName()
    {
        Console.WriteLine(name);    // Can access the field
    }
}
```

## Constants

If you have values that should never change during program execution, you can use constants:

```csharp
const double Pi = 3.14159;
const string CompanyName = "Acme Corporation";

// Cannot be changed later in the program
// Pi = 3.14;  // This would cause a compile error
```

## Practical Example: Temperature Converter

Let's build a simple temperature converter that demonstrates the use of variables:

```csharp
using System;

class TemperatureConverter
{
    static void Main()
    {
        // Declare variables
        double celsius, fahrenheit;
        
        // Get input from user
        Console.Write("Enter temperature in Celsius: ");
        string input = Console.ReadLine();
        
        // Convert input to double and store in variable
        celsius = Convert.ToDouble(input);
        
        // Calculate conversion using the variable
        fahrenheit = (celsius * 9 / 5) + 32;
        
        // Output the result using variables
        Console.WriteLine($"{celsius}째C is equal to {fahrenheit}째F");
    }
}
```

Example output:
```
Enter temperature in Celsius: 25
25째C is equal to 77째F
```

## Variable Type Conversion

C# provides several ways to convert variables from one type to another:

### Implicit Conversion

Automatic conversion happens when there's no risk of data loss:

```csharp
int intNumber = 10;
double doubleNumber = intNumber;  // Implicit conversion from int to double
```

### Explicit Conversion (Casting)

Explicit casting is required when there's a risk of data loss:

```csharp
double doubleNumber = 10.5;
int intNumber = (int)doubleNumber;  // Explicit cast, intNumber becomes 10
```

### Convert Class

The `Convert` class provides methods for converting between types:

```csharp
string stringValue = "42";
int intValue = Convert.ToInt32(stringValue);
double doubleValue = Convert.ToDouble(stringValue);
```

### Parsing Methods

Type-specific parsing methods:

```csharp
string stringValue = "42";
int intValue = int.Parse(stringValue);
```

### TryParse for Safe Conversion

For safer conversions that handle potential errors:

```csharp
string userInput = "abc";
int number;

if (int.TryParse(userInput, out number))
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Parsed successfully: {number}");
}
else
{
    Console.WriteLine("Could not parse the input as an integer");
}
```
