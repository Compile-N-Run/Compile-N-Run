# C# Constants

## Introduction

Constants are fixed values that cannot be changed during the execution of a program. They are useful when you have data that should remain unchanged throughout your application, such as mathematical values, configuration settings, or any value that should never be modified.

In C#, constants are declared using the `const` keyword, and they must be initialized at the time of declaration. Unlike variables, constants are immutable, meaning their values cannot be modified after they are declared.

## Declaring Constants in C#

### Basic Syntax

The basic syntax for declaring a constant in C# is:

```csharp
const dataType constantName = value;
```

For example:

```csharp
const int MaxAttempts = 5;
const double Pi = 3.14159;
const string WelcomeMessage = "Welcome to C# Programming!";
```

### Rules for Constants

Here are some important rules to remember when working with constants:

1. Constants must be initialized when declared
2. Once assigned, their values cannot be changed
3. Constants are implicitly static, so you don't need to use the `static` keyword
4. Constants can only be assigned values known at compile-time

## Types of Constants

### Literal Constants

Literal constants are values that are directly written in the code:

```csharp
// Numeric literals
int x = 10;        // Integer literal
double y = 3.14;   // Double literal

// String literals
string name = "John";  // String literal

// Character literals
char c = 'A';      // Character literal

// Boolean literals
bool isTrue = true;  // Boolean literal
```

### Declared Constants

Declared constants use the `const` keyword:

```csharp
public class MathUtility
{
    // Declared constant
    public const double Pi = 3.14159;
    public const int MaxValue = 100;
}
```

## Example: Using Constants

Here's a complete example that demonstrates how to use constants:

```csharp
using System;

namespace ConstantsDemo
{
    class Program
    {
        // Constants at class level
        const int MaxStudents = 30;
        const double TaxRate = 0.07;
        const string SchoolName = "Coding Academy";

        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            // Using constants in calculations
            int numberOfStudents = 25;
            Console.WriteLine($"School: {SchoolName}");
            Console.WriteLine($"Maximum number of students allowed: {MaxStudents}");
            Console.WriteLine($"Available seats: {MaxStudents - numberOfStudents}");

            // Using constants in financial calculations
            double orderTotal = 100.00;
            double taxAmount = orderTotal * TaxRate;
            double finalTotal = orderTotal + taxAmount;

            Console.WriteLine($"Order: ${orderTotal:F2}");
            Console.WriteLine($"Tax ({TaxRate:P0}): ${taxAmount:F2}");
            Console.WriteLine($"Total: ${finalTotal:F2}");
        }
    }
}
```

Output:
```
School: Coding Academy
Maximum number of students allowed: 30
Available seats: 5
Order: $100.00
Tax (7%): $7.00
Total: $107.00
```

## Constants vs Read-Only Fields

It's important to understand the difference between constants and read-only fields in C#:

1. Constants (`const`)
   - Evaluated at compile-time
   - Must be assigned at declaration
   - Can only use values known at compile-time
   - Implicitly static

2. Read-only fields (`readonly`)
   - Evaluated at runtime
   - Can be assigned in the constructor
   - Can use values that are calculated at runtime
   - Can be instance-specific or static

Example of read-only fields:

```csharp
public class DateUtility
{
    // Constant - compile-time
    public const string DateFormat = "yyyy-MM-dd";
    
    // Read-only field - runtime
    public readonly DateTime ApplicationStartTime;
    
    public DateUtility()
    {
        // Can be set in constructor
        ApplicationStartTime = DateTime.Now;
    }
}
```

## When to Use Constants

Constants are ideal for:

1. **Mathematical constants**: π, e, gravity constants
2. **Configuration values**: Maximum file size, connection timeout
3. **Error codes and messages**: Error codes, standard error messages
4. **Fixed application settings**: Default values, application limits

## Real-World Example: Configuration Constants

Here's a more practical example of using constants in a real application:

```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;

namespace FileProcessingApp
{
    public class FileProcessor
    {
        // Configuration constants
        private const int MAX_FILE_SIZE_MB = 10;
        private const string ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS = ".txt,.csv,.xml";
        private const int READ_BUFFER_SIZE = 4096;
        private const string ERROR_LOG_PATH = "C:\\Logs\\errors.log";

        public bool ProcessFile(string filePath)
        {
            try
            {
                // Check if file exists
                if (!File.Exists(filePath))
                {
                    LogError($"File not found: {filePath}");
                    return false;
                }

                // Check file extension
                string extension = Path.GetExtension(filePath).ToLower();
                if (!ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS.Contains(extension))
                {
                    LogError($"Unsupported file extension: {extension}");
                    return false;
                }

                // Check file size
                long fileSizeBytes = new FileInfo(filePath).Length;
                long fileSizeMB = fileSizeBytes / (1024 * 1024);
                if (fileSizeMB > MAX_FILE_SIZE_MB)
                {
                    LogError($"File too large: {fileSizeMB}MB exceeds {MAX_FILE_SIZE_MB}MB limit");
                    return false;
                }

                // Process file using buffer size constant
                using (FileStream fs = new FileStream(filePath, FileMode.Open))
                {
                    byte[] buffer = new byte[READ_BUFFER_SIZE];
                    // File processing logic...
                    Console.WriteLine($"Processing file: {Path.GetFileName(filePath)}");
                    Console.WriteLine($"Buffer size: {READ_BUFFER_SIZE} bytes");
                }

                return true;
            }
            catch (Exception ex)
            {
                LogError($"Error processing file: {ex.Message}");
                return false;
            }
        }

        private void LogError(string message)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"ERROR: {message}");
            // In a real app, we might write to the error log file specified in ERROR_LOG_PATH
        }
    }

    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            FileProcessor processor = new FileProcessor();
            processor.ProcessFile("sample.txt");
        }
    }
}
```

## Constants Best Practices

1. **Use ALL_CAPS with underscores** for constant naming to distinguish them from variables (this is a convention, not a requirement)
2. **Group related constants** together in a dedicated constants class or static class
3. **Don't overuse constants** - only use them for truly fixed values
4. **Use enums** instead of constants for related groups of values
5. **Document the meaning** of constants with comments when the purpose isn't obvious

## Example: Constants Organization

Here's an example of organizing constants effectively:

```csharp
// Constants class for application configuration
public static class AppConfig
{
    // Database constants
    public const string CONNECTION_STRING = "Server=myserver;Database=mydb;User Id=admin;Password=password;";
    public const int COMMAND_TIMEOUT = 30;
    public const int MAX_CONNECTIONS = 100;
    
    // File system constants
    public const string UPLOAD_DIRECTORY = "C:\\Uploads";
    public const int MAX_UPLOAD_SIZE_MB = 50;
    public const string ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS = ".jpg,.png,.pdf";
    
    // Security constants
    public const int PASSWORD_MIN_LENGTH = 8;
    public const int LOGIN_ATTEMPTS_BEFORE_LOCKOUT = 5;
}
```

## Summary

Constants in C# are immutable values that cannot be changed during program execution. They are declared using the `const` keyword and must be initialized at declaration time. They improve code readability, maintainability, and prevent accidental changes to important values.

Key points to remember about constants:

- Constants are declared using the `const` keyword
- They must be assigned a value at declaration
- Their values cannot change during program execution
- Constants are evaluated at compile-time
- They are implicitly static
- Use constants for truly fixed values like mathematical constants or configuration settings

## Exercises

1. Create a program that calculates the area and circumference of a circle using a constant for π.
2. Create a `GameSettings` class with constants for player settings like maximum health, starting level, and game difficulty options.
3. Write a program that validates user passwords based on constant rules (minimum length, required characters, etc.).
4. Create a currency converter application that uses constants for conversion rates between different currencies.
