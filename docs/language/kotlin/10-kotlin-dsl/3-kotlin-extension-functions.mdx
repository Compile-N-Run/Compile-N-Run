# Kotlin Extension Functions

Extension functions are one of Kotlin's most powerful features that enable you to add new functionality to existing classes without having to inherit from them or modify their source code. This capability is especially crucial when building Domain Specific Languages (DSLs) in Kotlin, as it allows you to create expressive, readable code that feels like a natural part of the language.

## What Are Extension Functions?

In simple terms, an extension function allows you to "add" a method to a class without modifying its source code. This is particularly useful when:

- You're working with classes from libraries that you cannot modify
- You want to keep your code organized by functionality rather than by class
- You're building a DSL that requires intuitive, fluent method calls

## Basic Syntax

Here's the basic syntax of an extension function:

```kotlin
fun ReceiverType.functionName(parameters): ReturnType {
    // body of the function
}
```

Let's look at a simple example:

```kotlin
fun String.addExclamation(): String {
    return this + "!"
}

// Usage
val normalText = "Hello"
val excitedText = normalText.addExclamation()
println(excitedText)  // Output: Hello!
```

In this example:
- `String` is the receiver type
- `addExclamation` is the function name
- Inside the function, `this` refers to the instance of the receiver type

## The Power of `this` in Extension Functions

Within an extension function, `this` refers to the receiver object (the instance of the class being extended). This makes the syntax clean and intuitive:

```kotlin
fun List<Int>.sumOfSquares(): Int {
    return this.sumOf { it * it }
}

val numbers = listOf(1, 2, 3, 4)
println(numbers.sumOfSquares())  // Output: 30 (1² + 2² + 3² + 4² = 1 + 4 + 9 + 16 = 30)
```

## Extension Functions vs. Member Functions

While extension functions appear to be called just like regular member functions, they are actually different:

```kotlin
// Extension function
fun String.wordCount(): Int {
    return this.split(" ").count()
}

// Usage
val sentence = "This is a sample sentence"
println(sentence.wordCount())  // Output: 5
```

Differences to note:
1. Extension functions are resolved **statically**
2. They don't allow access to private or protected members of the class
3. They can't be overridden like virtual methods

## Extension Functions in DSL Building

Extension functions are fundamental to Kotlin DSL creation. They enable you to:

1. Create fluent interfaces
2. Add contextual functionality
3. Build type-safe builders

Here's a simple example of how extension functions contribute to a DSL for building HTML:

```kotlin
fun StringBuilder.h1(content: String) {
    append("<h1>$content</h1>")
}

fun StringBuilder.p(content: String) {
    append("<p>$content</p>")
}

fun html(buildAction: StringBuilder.() -> Unit): String {
    val stringBuilder = StringBuilder()
    stringBuilder.buildAction()
    return stringBuilder.toString()
}

// Usage - this is our mini DSL
val htmlContent = html {
    h1("Welcome to Kotlin DSLs")
    p("This is a paragraph created using our simple HTML DSL.")
}

println(htmlContent)
/* Output:
<h1>Welcome to Kotlin DSLs</h1><p>This is a paragraph created using our simple HTML DSL.</p>
*/
```

## Extension Functions with Receivers

You can also define extension functions that have receivers, allowing you to build more complex DSLs:

```kotlin
class TaskContext {
    var description = ""
    var priority = 0
    
    fun tags(action: TagsBuilder.() -> Unit) {
        val builder = TagsBuilder()
        builder.action()
        // Process tags...
    }
}

class TagsBuilder {
    private val tags = mutableListOf<String>()
    
    fun tag(name: String) {
        tags.add(name)
    }
}

fun task(action: TaskContext.() -> Unit): TaskContext {
    val context = TaskContext()
    context.action()
    return context
}

// Usage
val myTask = task {
    description = "Learn Kotlin DSLs"
    priority = 1
    
    tags {
        tag("kotlin")
        tag("programming")
        tag("dsl")
    }
}

println("Task: ${myTask.description}, Priority: ${myTask.priority}")
// Output: Task: Learn Kotlin DSLs, Priority: 1
```

## Practical Applications

### 1. String Manipulations

```kotlin
fun String.truncate(maxLength: Int): String {
    return if (this.length <= maxLength) this else "${this.take(maxLength)}..."
}

val longText = "This is a very long text that needs to be truncated"
println(longText.truncate(10))  // Output: This is a...
```

### 2. Collection Transformations

```kotlin
fun <T> List<T>.second(): T {
    if (size < 2) throw NoSuchElementException("List has fewer than 2 elements")
    return this[1]
}

val fruits = listOf("apple", "banana", "cherry")
println(fruits.second())  // Output: banana
```

### 3. Builder Patterns

```kotlin
class EmailBuilder {
    var to = ""
    var subject = ""
    var body = ""
}

fun email(configure: EmailBuilder.() -> Unit): EmailBuilder {
    val builder = EmailBuilder()
    builder.configure()
    return builder
}

// Usage
val emailMessage = email {
    to = "friend@example.com"
    subject = "Kotlin Extension Functions"
    body = "They're amazing for building DSLs!"
}

println("To: ${emailMessage.to}")
println("Subject: ${emailMessage.subject}")
/* Output:
To: friend@example.com
Subject: Kotlin Extension Functions
*/
```

## Best Practices for Extension Functions

1. **Be descriptive with naming**: Extension function names should clearly indicate what they do
2. **Respect the single responsibility principle**: Each extension should do one thing well
3. **Place extensions in appropriate packages**: Group related extensions together
4. **Consider using extension properties** for computed values that don't take parameters:

```kotlin
val String.isEmail: Boolean
    get() = matches(Regex("[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}"))

println("user@example.com".isEmail)  // Output: true
println("not-an-email".isEmail)     // Output: false
```

## Summary

Kotlin extension functions allow you to extend existing classes with new functionality without inheritance or modification of the original source code. This feature is particularly powerful for creating expressive, readable DSLs by:

- Adding methods to existing types
- Creating fluent interfaces
- Building type-safe builders
- Organizing code by functionality rather than by class structure

As you develop more complex Kotlin applications, extension functions will become an essential tool in your programming toolbox, enabling you to write more expressive and maintainable code.

## Exercises

1. Create an extension function for the `Int` type that returns whether the number is prime.
2. Implement an extension function for `List<String>` that joins the strings with a custom separator and prefix/suffix.
3. Build a mini-DSL using extension functions for creating a simple to-do list application.
4. Create an extension function for the `File` class that makes reading text files easier.
