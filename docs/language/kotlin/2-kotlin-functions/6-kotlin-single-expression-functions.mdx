# Kotlin Single Expression Functions

In Kotlin, writing concise and readable code is a priority. One feature that helps achieve this goal is **single expression functions** - a way to define functions in a more compact form when they consist of just one expression.

## What are Single Expression Functions?

Single expression functions are functions that return the result of a single expression. Instead of using curly braces `{}` and an explicit `return` statement, you can simply use the assignment operator (`=`) followed by the expression.

### Basic Syntax

The syntax for single expression functions is:

```kotlin
fun functionName(parameters): ReturnType = expression
```

## Regular Functions vs. Single Expression Functions

Let's compare the traditional function syntax with single expression functions:

### Traditional Function

```kotlin
fun add(a: Int, b: Int): Int {
    return a + b
}
```

### Single Expression Function

```kotlin
fun add(a: Int, b: Int): Int = a + b
```

Both functions do exactly the same thing, but the single expression version is more concise.

## Type Inference in Single Expression Functions

Kotlin's type inference works particularly well with single expression functions. You can often omit the return type:

```kotlin
fun add(a: Int, b: Int) = a + b
```

The Kotlin compiler can infer that this function returns an `Int` based on the expression on the right-hand side.

However, it's often considered good practice to include return types for public functions to make the API more self-documenting.

## Examples of Single Expression Functions

### Example 1: Simple Calculations

```kotlin
fun square(number: Int) = number * number

// Usage:
fun main() {
    val result = square(5)
    println("Square of 5 is $result") // Output: Square of 5 is 25
}
```

### Example 2: String Operations

```kotlin
fun greet(name: String) = "Hello, $name!"

// Usage:
fun main() {
    val greeting = greet("Kotlin")
    println(greeting) // Output: Hello, Kotlin!
}
```

### Example 3: Boolean Checks

```kotlin
fun isEven(number: Int) = number % 2 == 0

// Usage:
fun main() {
    println("Is 4 even? ${isEven(4)}") // Output: Is 4 even? true
    println("Is 7 even? ${isEven(7)}") // Output: Is 7 even? false
}
```

## When to Use Single Expression Functions

Single expression functions are ideal for:

1. **Simple operations**: When your function performs one simple operation
2. **Transformations**: Converting one value to another
3. **Predicates**: Functions that return boolean results
4. **Delegate functions**: Functions that simply call another function

## When Not to Use Single Expression Functions

Single expression functions might not be appropriate when:

1. **The logic is complex**: If the expression becomes too long or complex
2. **Multiple operations** are needed that can't be combined into a single expression
3. **Debugging** is required (it's harder to set breakpoints within single expressions)

## Real-World Applications

### Example: Data Processing

```kotlin
// Converting a database entity to a UI model
fun convertUserToViewModel(user: User) = UserViewModel(
    id = user.id,
    displayName = "${user.firstName} ${user.lastName}",
    isActive = user.status == "ACTIVE"
)

// Usage in an app
fun displayUserInfo(userId: String) {
    val user = fetchUserFromDatabase(userId)
    val viewModel = convertUserToViewModel(user)
    renderUserInterface(viewModel)
}
```

### Example: Math Utilities

```kotlin
fun calculateCircleArea(radius: Double) = Math.PI * radius * radius

// Usage:
fun main() {
    val radius = 5.0
    val area = calculateCircleArea(radius)
    println("Area of circle with radius $radius is $area") 
    // Output: Area of circle with radius 5.0 is 78.53981633974483
}
```

### Example: Functional Programming

Single expression functions work well in functional programming paradigms:

```kotlin
fun main() {
    val numbers = listOf(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)
    
    // Using single expression functions with higher-order functions
    val doubled = numbers.map { it * 2 }
    val filtered = numbers.filter { it % 2 == 0 }
    
    println("Doubled: $doubled") // Output: Doubled: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12]
    println("Even numbers: $filtered") // Output: Even numbers: [2, 4, 6]
}
```

## Making Complex Logic Work in Single Expression Functions

Sometimes you can use Kotlin's powerful features to make more complex logic fit into a single expression:

### Using if-else as an Expression

```kotlin
fun max(a: Int, b: Int) = if (a > b) a else b

// Usage:
fun main() {
    println("Maximum of 5 and 3 is ${max(5, 3)}") // Output: Maximum of 5 and 3 is 5
}
```

### Using when as an Expression

```kotlin
fun describe(number: Int) = when {
    number < 0 -> "Negative"
    number == 0 -> "Zero"
    number % 2 == 0 -> "Positive even"
    else -> "Positive odd"
}

// Usage:
fun main() {
    println(describe(-5)) // Output: Negative
    println(describe(0))  // Output: Zero
    println(describe(4))  // Output: Positive even
    println(describe(7))  // Output: Positive odd
}
```

### Using try-catch as an Expression

```kotlin
fun parseIntSafely(s: String) = try {
    s.toInt()
} catch (e: NumberFormatException) {
    null
}

// Usage:
fun main() {
    println(parseIntSafely("123"))  // Output: 123
    println(parseIntSafely("abc"))  // Output: null
}
```

## Summary

Kotlin single expression functions allow you to write concise, readable code by eliminating boilerplate when a function consists of just one expression. They are particularly useful for simple operations, transformations, and predicates.

Key benefits include:

- **Reduced verbosity**: Less code to write and maintain
- **Improved readability**: The function's purpose is often clearer
- **Type inference**: Return type can often be inferred by the compiler
- **Functional style**: Encourages a more functional programming approach

As you develop your Kotlin programming skills, single expression functions will become a natural part of your coding style, helping you write more elegant code.

## Exercises

1. Convert these regular functions to single expression functions:
   ```kotlin
   fun multiply(a: Int, b: Int): Int {
       return a * b
   }
   
   fun capitalize(text: String): String {
       return text.uppercase()
   }
   ```

2. Create a single expression function called `isAdult` that checks if a given age is 18 or above.

3. Write a single expression function that returns the absolute value of a number without using the standard library's `abs` function.

4. Create a single expression function that formats a person's full name given their first and last names.
