# Kotlin Function Scope

## Introduction

Understanding function scope is essential for writing clean, maintainable Kotlin code. Scope defines where a function can be accessed and where variables declared within a function are visible. This concept directly impacts how you structure your code, how variables are shared between functions, and how memory is managed in your applications.

In this tutorial, we'll explore the different types of function scopes in Kotlin, how variables behave within these scopes, and best practices for managing scope in your projects.

## Types of Function Scopes in Kotlin

Kotlin offers three primary types of function scopes:

1. **Top-level functions** - accessible throughout the package
2. **Member functions** - functions defined within classes
3. **Local functions** - functions defined inside other functions

Let's examine each type:

### Top-level Functions

In Kotlin, unlike some other languages like Java, functions can exist outside of classes. These are called top-level functions and are accessible throughout the package.

```kotlin
// File: MathOperations.kt
package math

fun add(a: Int, b: Int): Int {
    return a + b
}

fun subtract(a: Int, b: Int): Int {
    return a - b
}
```

To use these functions from another file:

```kotlin
import math.add
import math.subtract

fun main() {
    println("10 + 5 = ${add(10, 5)}") // Output: 10 + 5 = 15
    println("10 - 5 = ${subtract(10, 5)}") // Output: 10 - 5 = 5
}
```

### Member Functions

Member functions are defined within classes or objects:

```kotlin
class Calculator {
    // Member functions
    fun add(a: Int, b: Int): Int {
        return a + b
    }
    
    fun multiply(a: Int, b: Int): Int {
        return a * b
    }
}

fun main() {
    val calc = Calculator()
    println("3 + 4 = ${calc.add(3, 4)}") // Output: 3 + 4 = 7
    println("3 * 4 = ${calc.multiply(3, 4)}") // Output: 3 * 4 = 12
}
```

Member functions can access all properties of their class, and their scope is limited to the class they are defined in.

### Local Functions

One of Kotlin's powerful features is the ability to define functions inside other functions. These are called local functions:

```kotlin
fun processUser(userId: String) {
    // This is a local function
    fun validateUserId(id: String): Boolean {
        return id.length >= 4
    }
    
    if (!validateUserId(userId)) {
        println("Invalid user ID: $userId")
        return
    }
    
    println("Processing user: $userId")
}

fun main() {
    processUser("123") // Output: Invalid user ID: 123
    processUser("1234") // Output: Processing user: 1234
}
```

Local functions have access to the parameters and variables of the outer function, which makes them powerful for encapsulating logic that's only needed within the context of the parent function.

## Variable Scope in Functions

Variables defined within a function are only accessible within that function's scope, unless they're passed as arguments or returned as values.

### Local Variables

```kotlin
fun calculateTotal(items: List<Double>): Double {
    var total = 0.0 // Local variable
    
    for (item in items) {
        total += item
    }
    
    return total
}

fun main() {
    val prices = listOf(10.99, 5.99, 3.99)
    val total = calculateTotal(prices)
    println("Total: $total") // Output: Total: 20.97
    
    // This would cause an error - total is not accessible here
    // println(total)
}
```

### Captured Variables

Local functions can access and modify variables from their outer scope:

```kotlin
fun countOccurrences(text: String, char: Char): Int {
    var count = 0
    
    fun scan(position: Int) {
        // Local function accessing and modifying the outer function's variable
        if (position < text.length) {
            if (text[position] == char) {
                count++
            }
            scan(position + 1)
        }
    }
    
    scan(0)
    return count
}

fun main() {
    val occurrences = countOccurrences("Mississippi", 's')
    println("'s' appears $occurrences times") // Output: 's' appears 4 times
}
```

In this example, the local `scan` function can access and modify the `count` variable from its parent function.

## Variable Shadowing

When a local variable has the same name as a variable in an outer scope, the local variable "shadows" the outer one:

```kotlin
fun demonstrateShadowing() {
    val x = 10
    
    fun innerFunction() {
        val x = 20 // This shadows the outer x
        println("Inner x: $x") // Uses the local x
    }
    
    println("Outer x: $x") // Uses the outer x
    innerFunction()
    println("Outer x after inner function: $x") // Still uses the outer x
}

fun main() {
    demonstrateShadowing()
    // Output:
    // Outer x: 10
    // Inner x: 20
    // Outer x after inner function: 10
}
```

## Practical Example: Processing CSV Data

Let's look at a real-world example where function scope is useful. Here we'll create a CSV parser with different levels of scope:

```kotlin
fun parseCSV(csvContent: String): List<Map<String, String>> {
    val result = mutableListOf<Map<String, String>>()
    val lines = csvContent.trim().split("\n")
    
    if (lines.isEmpty()) return result
    
    val headers = lines[0].split(",")
    
    // Local function to process each line
    fun processLine(line: String): Map<String, String> {
        val values = line.split(",")
        val rowData = mutableMapOf<String, String>()
        
        // Local function to clean cell data
        fun cleanCellValue(value: String): String {
            return value.trim().removeSurrounding("\"")
        }
        
        for (i in headers.indices) {
            if (i < values.size) {
                rowData[cleanCellValue(headers[i])] = cleanCellValue(values[i])
            }
        }
        
        return rowData
    }
    
    // Process all data lines (skip header)
    for (i in 1 until lines.size) {
        result.add(processLine(lines[i]))
    }
    
    return result
}

fun main() {
    val csvData = """
        Name,Age,City
        "John Doe",30,"New York"
        "Jane Smith",25,London
        "Bob Johnson",42,Paris
    """.trimIndent()
    
    val parsed = parseCSV(csvData)
    
    // Print the results
    parsed.forEach { row ->
        println("Person: ${row["Name"]}, Age: ${row["Age"]}, City: ${row["City"]}")
    }
}

// Output:
// Person: John Doe, Age: 30, City: New York
// Person: Jane Smith, Age: 25, City: London
// Person: Bob Johnson, Age: 42, City: Paris
```

In this example:
- `parseCSV` is a top-level function
- `processLine` is a local function inside `parseCSV`
- `cleanCellValue` is a local function inside `processLine`

Each function has access to variables from its parent scope, which allows for a clean implementation with minimal parameter passing.

## Best Practices for Managing Function Scope

1. **Minimize Variable Scope**: Keep variables in the smallest scope possible to reduce complexity and potential bugs.

2. **Use Local Functions for Helper Logic**: When a piece of logic is only needed within one function, define it as a local function rather than cluttering your class or package.

3. **Avoid Excessive Nesting**: While local functions are powerful, too much nesting can make code hard to read. If your function has multiple levels of local functions, consider refactoring.

4. **Be Careful with Captured Variables**: When local functions modify variables from outer scopes, it can sometimes lead to unexpected behavior, especially in concurrent or asynchronous code.

5. **Be Explicit About Scope Intent**: Use naming conventions or comments to clarify the intended scope of your functions and variables.

## Summary

Function scope in Kotlin defines where functions can be accessed and where variables within them are visible:

- **Top-level functions** are accessible throughout their package
- **Member functions** are tied to class instances
- **Local functions** can access variables from their parent scope

Understanding these scope concepts helps you write cleaner, more modular code while avoiding common pitfalls like unintended variable access or namespace pollution.

## Exercises

1. Create a top-level function that contains a local function. Have the local function access and modify a variable from the outer function's scope.

2. Write a class with member functions that demonstrate variable shadowing.

3. Refactor the CSV parsing example to use classes and member functions instead of local functions. Compare the two approaches - which do you find more readable?

4. Create a function that demonstrates capturing variables in a local lambda function rather than a local named function.
