# Kotlin Map Filter Reduce

Functional programming provides powerful tools for processing collections of data. In Kotlin, the `map`, `filter`, and `reduce` functions allow you to transform, select, and combine collection elements with clean, expressive code. These functions are fundamental building blocks in functional programming that can make your code more concise and readable.

## Introduction to Functional Collection Operations

Traditional imperative programming often involves explicit loops and mutable variables to process collections. Functional programming takes a different approach by providing higher-order functions that operate on collections as a whole. The three most common operations are:

- **Map**: Transform each element in a collection
- **Filter**: Select elements that meet specific criteria
- **Reduce**: Combine all elements into a single result

Let's explore each of these operations in detail.

## The Map Function

The `map` function transforms each element in a collection and returns a new collection containing the results.

### Basic Syntax

```kotlin
val transformedCollection = collection.map { element -> transformation(element) }
```

### How Map Works

1. It takes a lambda function as a parameter
2. It applies this function to each element in the collection
3. It returns a new collection with the transformed elements

### Example: Squaring Numbers

```kotlin
fun main() {
    val numbers = listOf(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
    val squared = numbers.map { it * it }
    
    println("Original numbers: $numbers")
    println("Squared numbers: $squared")
}
```

**Output:**
```
Original numbers: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Squared numbers: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
```

### Example: Transforming Strings

```kotlin
fun main() {
    val names = listOf("Alice", "Bob", "Charlie")
    val greetings = names.map { "Hello, $it!" }
    
    println(greetings.joinToString("\n"))
}
```

**Output:**
```
Hello, Alice!
Hello, Bob!
Hello, Charlie!
```

## The Filter Function

The `filter` function selects elements from a collection that satisfy a specific condition.

### Basic Syntax

```kotlin
val filteredCollection = collection.filter { element -> condition(element) }
```

### How Filter Works

1. It takes a predicate (a function that returns a boolean) as a parameter
2. It evaluates each element against the predicate
3. It returns a new collection containing only elements that satisfy the condition

### Example: Finding Even Numbers

```kotlin
fun main() {
    val numbers = listOf(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8)
    val evenNumbers = numbers.filter { it % 2 == 0 }
    
    println("All numbers: $numbers")
    println("Even numbers: $evenNumbers")
}
```

**Output:**
```
All numbers: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
Even numbers: [2, 4, 6, 8]
```

### Example: Filtering Strings

```kotlin
fun main() {
    val words = listOf("apple", "banana", "avocado", "cherry", "apricot")
    val aWords = words.filter { it.startsWith('a') }
    
    println("Words that start with 'a': $aWords")
}
```

**Output:**
```
Words that start with 'a': [apple, avocado, apricot]
```

## The Reduce Function

The `reduce` function combines all elements in a collection into a single value.

### Basic Syntax

```kotlin
val result = collection.reduce { accumulator, element -> operation(accumulator, element) }
```

### How Reduce Works

1. It takes a lambda function with two parameters: an accumulator and the current element
2. It starts with the first element as the initial accumulator value
3. For each subsequent element, it applies the operation to the accumulator and the element
4. It returns the final accumulated value

### Example: Summing Numbers

```kotlin
fun main() {
    val numbers = listOf(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
    val sum = numbers.reduce { acc, number -> acc + number }
    
    println("Numbers: $numbers")
    println("Sum: $sum")
}
```

**Output:**
```
Numbers: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Sum: 15
```

### Example: Finding Maximum Value

```kotlin
fun main() {
    val numbers = listOf(8, 12, 3, 17, 9, 5)
    val max = numbers.reduce { max, number -> if (number > max) number else max }
    
    println("Numbers: $numbers")
    println("Maximum: $max")
}
```

**Output:**
```
Numbers: [8, 12, 3, 17, 9, 5]
Maximum: 17
```

### The `fold` Alternative

`fold` is similar to `reduce` but allows you to specify an initial value:

```kotlin
fun main() {
    val numbers = listOf(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
    val sumWithInitial = numbers.fold(10) { acc, number -> acc + number }
    
    println("Sum with initial value 10: $sumWithInitial")
}
```

**Output:**
```
Sum with initial value 10: 25
```

## Combining Map, Filter, and Reduce

These functions can be chained together to perform complex operations in a concise, readable way.

### Example: Average of Even Numbers

```kotlin
fun main() {
    val numbers = listOf(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10)
    
    // Find the average of even numbers
    val evenNumbers = numbers.filter { it % 2 == 0 }
    val sum = evenNumbers.reduce { acc, num -> acc + num }
    val average = sum.toDouble() / evenNumbers.size
    
    // Alternative: chain the operations
    val averageChained = numbers
        .filter { it % 2 == 0 }
        .average()
    
    println("Even numbers: $evenNumbers")
    println("Average: $average")
    println("Average (chained): $averageChained")
}
```

**Output:**
```
Even numbers: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
Average: 6.0
Average (chained): 6.0
```

## Real-World Applications

### Processing User Data

```kotlin
data class User(val id: Int, val name: String, val age: Int, val isActive: Boolean)

fun main() {
    val users = listOf(
        User(1, "Alice", 28, true),
        User(2, "Bob", 19, false),
        User(3, "Charlie", 32, true),
        User(4, "Diana", 22, true),
        User(5, "Evan", 45, false)
    )
    
    // Get names of active adult users
    val activeAdultNames = users
        .filter { it.isActive }
        .filter { it.age >= 18 }
        .map { it.name }
    
    println("Active adult users: $activeAdultNames")
    
    // Calculate average age of active users
    val averageAgeOfActiveUsers = users
        .filter { it.isActive }
        .map { it.age }
        .average()
    
    println("Average age of active users: $averageAgeOfActiveUsers")
}
```

**Output:**
```
Active adult users: [Alice, Charlie, Diana]
Average age of active users: 27.333333333333332
```

### Processing Text

```kotlin
fun main() {
    val text = """
        Kotlin is a modern programming language
        that makes developers happier.
        It's concise, safe, interoperable, and tool-friendly.
    """.trimIndent()
    
    // Count words by length
    val wordLengths = text
        .replace(Regex("[^\\w\\s]"), "")
        .split(Regex("\\s+"))
        .map { it.length }
        .groupBy { it }
        .mapValues { it.value.size }
    
    println("Word count by length: $wordLengths")
    
    // Find the longest word
    val longestWord = text
        .replace(Regex("[^\\w\\s]"), "")
        .split(Regex("\\s+"))
        .maxByOrNull { it.length }
    
    println("Longest word: $longestWord")
}
```

**Output:**
```
Word count by length: {6=3, 2=3, 7=2, 5=1, 8=2, 11=1, 12=1, 4=1, 9=1}
Longest word: interoperable
```

## Performance Considerations

When working with large collections, be mindful of the following:

1. Chaining multiple operations can create intermediate collections, which might impact performance
2. For better performance with multiple operations, consider using sequences:

```kotlin
fun main() {
    val numbers = (1..1000000).toList()
    
    // Using sequences to avoid creating intermediate collections
    val sumOfSquaredEvenNumbers = numbers
        .asSequence()
        .filter { it % 2 == 0 }
        .map { it * it }
        .take(100)
        .sum()
    
    println("Sum of first 100 squared even numbers: $sumOfSquaredEvenNumbers")
}
```

## Summary

Map, filter, and reduce are powerful functional programming tools in Kotlin that allow you to:

- **Map**: Transform each element in a collection
- **Filter**: Select elements based on a condition
- **Reduce**: Combine elements into a single result

These functions enable you to write more expressive, concise, and readable code by focusing on what you want to accomplish rather than how to loop through collections.

By chaining these operations, you can create complex data processing pipelines with minimal code, making your programs easier to understand and maintain.
