# Kotlin Loops

Loops are fundamental programming constructs that allow you to execute a block of code repeatedly. In Kotlin, loops help you automate repetitive tasks, iterate through collections, and implement algorithms efficiently. This guide covers all the loop types in Kotlin with examples to help you understand when and how to use each one.

## Introduction to Loops

In programming, loops enable you to repeat a block of code multiple times rather than writing the same code over and over. This makes your code more concise, readable, and maintainable. Kotlin provides several types of loops:

- `for` loops
- `while` loops
- `do-while` loops

Let's explore each type in detail.

## For Loops

The `for` loop in Kotlin is primarily designed for iterating over ranges, arrays, collections, or anything that provides an iterator. It's more concise and safer than traditional C-style for loops.

### Basic For Loop with Ranges

In Kotlin, ranges are a powerful feature often used with for loops.

```kotlin
fun main() {
    // Loop through numbers 1 to 5
    for (i in 1..5) {
        println("Number: $i")
    }
}
```

**Output:**
```
Number: 1
Number: 2
Number: 3
Number: 4
Number: 5
```

### Iterating in Reverse Order

To iterate in reverse order, use the `downTo` keyword:

```kotlin
fun main() {
    // Loop from 5 down to 1
    for (i in 5 downTo 1) {
        println("Counting down: $i")
    }
}
```

**Output:**
```
Counting down: 5
Counting down: 4
Counting down: 3
Counting down: 2
Counting down: 1
```

### Specifying Step Size

You can control the step size using the `step` keyword:

```kotlin
fun main() {
    // Count from 1 to 10, but increment by 2 each time
    for (i in 1..10 step 2) {
        println("Odd number: $i")
    }
}
```

**Output:**
```
Odd number: 1
Odd number: 3
Odd number: 5
Odd number: 7
Odd number: 9
```

### Iterating Through Collections

The `for` loop is great for iterating through collections like arrays, lists, and maps:

```kotlin
fun main() {
    val fruits = listOf("Apple", "Banana", "Cherry", "Date")
    
    for (fruit in fruits) {
        println("I like $fruit")
    }
    
    // With index
    for ((index, fruit) in fruits.withIndex()) {
        println("Fruit at position $index is $fruit")
    }
}
```

**Output:**
```
I like Apple
I like Banana
I like Cherry
I like Date
Fruit at position 0 is Apple
Fruit at position 1 is Banana
Fruit at position 2 is Cherry
Fruit at position 3 is Date
```

### Iterating Through Maps

For hashmaps or dictionaries, you can iterate through key-value pairs:

```kotlin
fun main() {
    val fruitInventory = mapOf(
        "Apple" to 10,
        "Banana" to 5,
        "Cherry" to 7
    )
    
    for ((fruit, quantity) in fruitInventory) {
        println("We have $quantity ${fruit}s in stock")
    }
}
```

**Output:**
```
We have 10 Apples in stock
We have 5 Bananas in stock
We have 7 Cherrys in stock
```

## While Loops

A `while` loop executes a block of code repeatedly as long as a specified condition is `true`.

### Basic While Loop

Here's the basic structure of a while loop:

```kotlin
fun main() {
    var count = 1
    
    while (count <= 5) {
        println("Count: $count")
        count++
    }
}
```

**Output:**
```
Count: 1
Count: 2
Count: 3
Count: 4
Count: 5
```

### Using While for User Input Validation

While loops are often used for validating user input:

```kotlin
fun main() {
    var userInput: String?
    var validInput = false
    
    println("This is a simulation of validating user input")
    println("(In a real program, you'd use readLine() to get input)")
    
    // Simulating a sequence of inputs
    val inputs = listOf("invalid", "still wrong", "correct password")
    var inputIndex = 0
    
    while (!validInput && inputIndex < inputs.size) {
        // Simulate getting the next input
        userInput = inputs[inputIndex++]
        println("User entered: $userInput")
        
        if (userInput == "correct password") {
            validInput = true
            println("Access granted!")
        } else {
            println("Invalid input. Please try again.")
        }
    }
}
```

**Output:**
```
This is a simulation of validating user input
(In a real program, you'd use readLine() to get input)
User entered: invalid
Invalid input. Please try again.
User entered: still wrong
Invalid input. Please try again.
User entered: correct password
Access granted!
```

## Do-While Loops

A `do-while` loop is similar to a while loop, but it guarantees that the code block executes at least once before checking the condition.

### Basic Do-While Loop

```kotlin
fun main() {
    var count = 1
    
    do {
        println("Count: $count")
        count++
    } while (count <= 5)
}
```

**Output:**
```
Count: 1
Count: 2
Count: 3
Count: 4
Count: 5
```

### Do-While for Menu Systems

Do-while loops are ideal for menu-driven programs:

```kotlin
fun main() {
    var choice: Int
    
    // Simulating a menu system
    do {
        println("\n---- Menu ----")
        println("1. Option One")
        println("2. Option Two")
        println("3. Option Three")
        println("0. Exit")
        
        // In a real program, you would get user input
        // For this example, we'll simulate a sequence of choices
        val choices = listOf(1, 2, 3, 0)
        choice = choices[Math.floor(Math.random() * choices.size).toInt()]
        
        println("Selected: $choice")
        
        when (choice) {
            1 -> println("Processing Option One...")
            2 -> println("Processing Option Two...")
            3 -> println("Processing Option Three...")
            0 -> println("Exiting program...")
            else -> println("Invalid choice!")
        }
    } while (choice != 0)
}
```

**Note**: The output will vary based on the random selections, but the loop will continue until option 0 is selected.

## Loop Control Statements

Kotlin provides statements to control the flow within loops:

### Break Statement

The `break` statement terminates the loop immediately:

```kotlin
fun main() {
    for (i in 1..10) {
        if (i == 5) {
            println("Breaking at $i")
            break
        }
        println("Number: $i")
    }
    println("Loop ended")
}
```

**Output:**
```
Number: 1
Number: 2
Number: 3
Number: 4
Breaking at 5
Loop ended
```

### Continue Statement

The `continue` statement skips the current iteration and proceeds to the next one:

```kotlin
fun main() {
    for (i in 1..5) {
        if (i == 3) {
            println("Skipping number 3")
            continue
        }
        println("Number: $i")
    }
}
```

**Output:**
```
Number: 1
Number: 2
Skipping number 3
Number: 4
Number: 5
```

### Labeled Breaks and Continues

Kotlin supports labels that allow you to break or continue from specific loops in nested loop structures:

```kotlin
fun main() {
    outerLoop@ for (i in 1..3) {
        for (j in 1..3) {
            if (i == 2 && j == 2) {
                println("Breaking outer loop when i=$i and j=$j")
                break@outerLoop
            }
            println("i=$i, j=$j")
        }
    }
}
```

**Output:**
```
i=1, j=1
i=1, j=2
i=1, j=3
i=2, j=1
Breaking outer loop when i=2 and j=2
```

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Processing Data in Batches

Here's an example of how loops can be used to process data in batches:

```kotlin
fun main() {
    val data = listOf("Item1", "Item2", "Item3", "Item4", "Item5", 
                     "Item6", "Item7", "Item8", "Item9", "Item10")
    val batchSize = 3
    
    var batchNumber = 1
    
    for (i in data.indices step batchSize) {
        println("\nProcessing Batch #$batchNumber")
        
        // Calculate the end index for the current batch
        val endIndex = minOf(i + batchSize - 1, data.lastIndex)
        
        // Process items in the current batch
        for (j in i..endIndex) {
            println("Processing ${data[j]}")
        }
        
        batchNumber++
    }
}
```

**Output:**
```
Processing Batch #1
Processing Item1
Processing Item2
Processing Item3

Processing Batch #2
Processing Item4
Processing Item5
Processing Item6

Processing Batch #3
Processing Item7
Processing Item8
Processing Item9

Processing Batch #4
Processing Item10
```

### Example 2: Building a Simple Progress Bar

This example shows how to create a simple text-based progress bar:

```kotlin
fun main() {
    val totalSteps = 10
    val progressBarLength = 20
    
    println("Downloading file...")
    
    for (step in 1..totalSteps) {
        // Calculate progress percentage
        val progressPercentage = step * 100 / totalSteps
        
        // Calculate how many characters should be filled
        val filledLength = progressBarLength * step / totalSteps
        
        // Create the progress bar string
        val bar = "[" + "=".repeat(filledLength) + " ".repeat(progressBarLength - filledLength) + "]"
        
        // Print the progress bar
        println("$bar $progressPercentage%")
        
        // In a real application, you'd do some work here
        Thread.sleep(200) // Simulate work being done
    }
    
    println("Download complete!")
}
```

**Output:**
```
Downloading file...
[==                  ] 10%
[====                ] 20%
[======              ] 30%
[========            ] 40%
[==========          ] 50%
[============        ] 60%
[==============      ] 70%
[================    ] 80%
[==================  ] 90%
[====================] 100%

## Summary

In this guide, we've explored Kotlin's loop constructs:

- **For loops**: Perfect for iterating over ranges and collections
- **While loops**: Continue executing as long as a condition is true
- **Do-While loops**: Similar to while loops but execute at least once
- **Loop control statements**: Break, continue, and labeled breaks/continues

Loops are essential in programming as they help you automate repetitive tasks and process data efficiently. Choose the right loop based on your specific requirements:

- Use `for` loops when you know the number of iterations in advance
- Use `while` loops when you need to continue until a condition is met
- Use `do-while` loops when you need to execute the code at least once
