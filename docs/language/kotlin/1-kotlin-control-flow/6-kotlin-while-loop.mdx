# Kotlin While Loop

## Introduction

Loops are fundamental programming constructs that allow us to execute a block of code repeatedly based on a condition. In Kotlin, the `while` loop is one of the basic loop structures that continues to execute its body as long as its condition evaluates to `true`. 

Unlike `for` loops (which typically iterate a fixed number of times), `while` loops are particularly useful when you don't know in advance how many times you need to repeat a certain task.

## Basic Syntax

The basic syntax of a `while` loop in Kotlin is:

```kotlin
while (condition) {
    // code to be executed repeatedly
    // as long as condition is true
}
```

Here's how it works:
1. The condition is evaluated
2. If the condition is `true`, the code inside the loop executes
3. After execution, control returns to step 1
4. If the condition is `false`, the loop terminates and execution continues with the code after the loop

## Simple While Loop Example

Let's start with a basic example that counts from 1 to 5:

```kotlin
fun main() {
    var counter = 1
    
    while (counter <= 5) {
        println("Count: $counter")
        counter++ // increment counter by 1
    }
    
    println("Loop finished")
}
```

**Output:**
```
Count: 1
Count: 2
Count: 3
Count: 4
Count: 5
Loop finished
```

In this example:
- We initialize a `counter` variable to 1
- We run the loop as long as `counter` is less than or equal to 5
- Inside the loop, we print the current value and increment the counter
- Once the counter reaches 6, the condition becomes false, and the loop exits

## The do-while Loop Variant

Kotlin also provides a `do-while` loop, which is similar to the `while` loop but guarantees that the code block will execute at least once, regardless of whether the condition is initially `true`:

```kotlin
do {
    // code to be executed at least once
    // and then repeatedly as long as condition is true
} while (condition)
```

### Example of do-while Loop

```kotlin
fun main() {
    var number = 6
    
    do {
        println("Current number: $number")
        number++
    } while (number <= 5)
    
    println("Loop finished with number = $number")
}
```

**Output:**
```
Current number: 6
Loop finished with number = 7
```

Notice that even though the condition `number <= 5` was false from the beginning (since `number` was initialized as 6), the loop body still executed once before checking the condition.

## Infinite Loops

A loop whose condition always evaluates to `true` is called an infinite loop. They can be intentional or accidental:

```kotlin
// Intentional infinite loop
while (true) {
    println("This will run forever unless broken")
    // usually contains a break statement somewhere
}
```

To exit an infinite loop, you can use the `break` statement:

```kotlin
fun main() {
    var counter = 1
    
    while (true) {
        println("Iteration: $counter")
        counter++
        
        if (counter > 5) {
            println("Breaking the loop")
            break
        }
    }
    
    println("Loop finished")
}
```

**Output:**
```
Iteration: 1
Iteration: 2
Iteration: 3
Iteration: 4
Iteration: 5
Breaking the loop
Loop finished
```

## Using continue in While Loops

The `continue` statement skips the current iteration of the loop and proceeds with the next iteration:

```kotlin
fun main() {
    var counter = 0
    
    while (counter < 10) {
        counter++
        
        // Skip printing even numbers
        if (counter % 2 == 0) {
            continue
        }
        
        println("Odd number: $counter")
    }
}
```

**Output:**
```
Odd number: 1
Odd number: 3
Odd number: 5
Odd number: 7
Odd number: 9
```

## Nested While Loops

You can nest one while loop inside another:

```kotlin
fun main() {
    var i = 1
    
    while (i <= 3) {
        println("Outer loop: $i")
        
        var j = 1
        while (j <= 2) {
            println("  Inner loop: $j")
            j++
        }
        
        i++
    }
}
```

**Output:**
```
Outer loop: 1
  Inner loop: 1
  Inner loop: 2
Outer loop: 2
  Inner loop: 1
  Inner loop: 2
Outer loop: 3
  Inner loop: 1
  Inner loop: 2
```

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: User Input Validation

The `while` loop is great for validating user input until they provide a valid response:

```kotlin
fun main() {
    var userInput: Int?
    var validInput = false
    
    println("Please enter a number between 1 and 10:")
    
    while (!validInput) {
        try {
            userInput = readLine()?.toInt()
            
            if (userInput != null && userInput in 1..10) {
                println("Thank you! You entered: $userInput")
                validInput = true
            } else {
                println("Invalid input. Please enter a number between 1 and 10:")
            }
        } catch (e: NumberFormatException) {
            println("Invalid input. Please enter a number between 1 and 10:")
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, the loop continues until the user provides a valid number between 1 and 10.

### Example 2: Menu-Driven Application

A `while` loop can implement a menu-driven program structure:

```kotlin
fun main() {
    var running = true
    
    while (running) {
        println("\nMenu:")
        println("1. Say Hello")
        println("2. Calculate Sum")
        println("3. Exit")
        print("Enter your choice: ")
        
        when (readLine()?.toIntOrNull()) {
            1 -> println("Hello, user!")
            2 -> {
                println("Enter two numbers:")
                val a = readLine()?.toDoubleOrNull() ?: 0.0
                val b = readLine()?.toDoubleOrNull() ?: 0.0
                println("Sum: ${a + b}")
            }
            3 -> {
                println("Exiting program...")
                running = false
            }
            else -> println("Invalid option. Please try again.")
        }
    }
}
```

This example shows how a while loop can create an interactive menu that runs until the user chooses to exit.

## Best Practices

1. **Always ensure the loop condition will eventually become false**:
   Make sure your loop has a way to terminate, otherwise it becomes an infinite loop.

2. **Use appropriate loop variables**:
   Make sure your loop variables are correctly initialized and updated within the loop.

3. **Consider loop alternatives**:
   In some cases, a `for` loop or other Kotlin constructs like `.repeat()` or collection functions may be more appropriate.

4. **Be careful with loop conditions**:
   Double-check that your loop condition is correct to avoid off-by-one errors.

5. **Keep loops simple**:
   If your loop body becomes complex, consider refactoring parts of it into functions.

## Common Pitfalls

### Infinite Loops

The most common mistake is creating an accidental infinite loop by forgetting to update the condition variable:

```kotlin
// Problematic code - infinite loop
var i = 1
while (i <= 5) {
    println(i)
    // forgot to increment i!
}
```

### Fencepost Errors

Another common issue is "fencepost" or "off-by-one" errors:

```kotlin
var i = 0
while (i < 5) {
    i++
    println(i) // Prints 1 through 5, not 0 through 4
}
```

Be clear about whether you want to include or exclude the boundary values in your loop.

## Summary

The `while` loop in Kotlin is a fundamental control structure that allows you to repeatedly execute code based on a condition. Key points to remember:

- A `while` loop executes its body as long as its condition is `true`
- A `do-while` loop always executes its body at least once
- Use `break` to exit a loop early
- Use `continue` to skip to the next iteration
- Be cautious about infinite loops
- While loops are ideal when the number of iterations is not known in advance

## Exercises

To solidify your understanding of Kotlin while loops, try these exercises:

1. Write a program that uses a while loop to find the sum of all numbers from 1 to n, where n is provided by the user.

2. Create a guessing game where the computer generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the user tries to guess it. Use a while loop to keep asking until they get it right.

3. Implement a simple calculator program that uses a do-while loop to allow the user to perform multiple calculations until they choose to exit.

4. Write a program that prints a countdown from 10 to 1, then prints "Blastoff!"

5. Create a program that uses a while loop to print the first 10 Fibonacci numbers.
