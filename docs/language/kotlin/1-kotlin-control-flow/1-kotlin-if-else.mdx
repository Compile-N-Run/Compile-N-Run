# Kotlin If Else

In programming, we often need to make decisions based on certain conditions. Kotlin's `if-else` statements allow your program to execute different blocks of code depending on whether a condition is true or false. This fundamental control flow concept is essential for creating dynamic and responsive applications.

## Basic If Statement

The most basic form of conditional execution is the `if` statement, which runs a block of code only if a specified condition evaluates to `true`.

```kotlin
fun main() {
    val temperature = 28
    
    if (temperature > 25) {
        println("It's a hot day!")
    }
}
```

**Output:**
```
It's a hot day!
```

In this example, since the temperature (28) is greater than 25, the message is displayed. If the temperature had been 25 or lower, nothing would have been printed.

## If-Else Statement

To provide an alternative action when the condition is `false`, we use an `if-else` statement.

```kotlin
fun main() {
    val temperature = 15
    
    if (temperature > 25) {
        println("It's a hot day!")
    } else {
        println("It's not hot today.")
    }
}
```

**Output:**
```
It's not hot today.
```

Since the temperature is 15, which is not greater than 25, the `else` block executes.

## If-Else If-Else Chain

For more complex decisions with multiple conditions, we can use an `if-else if-else` chain.

```kotlin
fun main() {
    val temperature = 15
    
    if (temperature > 30) {
        println("It's very hot today!")
    } else if (temperature > 20) {
        println("It's warm today.")
    } else if (temperature > 10) {
        println("It's cool today.")
    } else {
        println("It's cold today!")
    }
}
```

**Output:**
```
It's cool today.
```

In this example, Kotlin checks each condition in sequence. Since the temperature is 15, it matches the condition `temperature > 10`, so "It's cool today." gets printed.

## If as an Expression

One of Kotlin's powerful features is that `if` can be used as an expression that returns a value. This is similar to the ternary operator in other languages.

```kotlin
fun main() {
    val temperature = 28
    
    val message = if (temperature > 25) {
        "It's hot today!"
    } else {
        "It's not hot today."
    }
    
    println(message)
}
```

**Output:**
```
It's hot today!
```

The `if-else` expression evaluates to either "It's hot today!" or "It's not hot today." based on the condition, and that value is assigned to the `message` variable.

### Simplified Expression Syntax

For simple expressions, you can write them more concisely:

```kotlin
val message = if (temperature > 25) "It's hot today!" else "It's not hot today."
```

This achieves the same result as the previous example.

## Nested If Statements

You can also nest `if` statements inside each other for more complex decision-making.

```kotlin
fun main() {
    val temperature = 28
    val isRaining = true
    
    if (temperature > 25) {
        println("It's hot today!")
        
        if (isRaining) {
            println("It's hot and rainy - it might be humid.")
        } else {
            println("It's hot but not raining - stay hydrated!")
        }
    } else {
        println("It's not hot today.")
        
        if (isRaining) {
            println("It's cool and rainy - take an umbrella!")
        } else {
            println("It's cool and dry - perfect weather!")
        }
    }
}
```

**Output:**
```
It's hot today!
It's hot and rainy - it might be humid.
```

While nesting is powerful, avoid excessive nesting as it can make your code harder to read and maintain.

## Logical Operators with If Statements

You can combine multiple conditions using logical operators:
- `&&` (AND): Both conditions must be true
- `||` (OR): At least one condition must be true
- `!` (NOT): Inverts a boolean result

```kotlin
fun main() {
    val temperature = 28
    val isRaining = true
    
    if (temperature > 25 && isRaining) {
        println("It's hot and rainy - it might be humid.")
    } else if (temperature > 25 || isRaining) {
        println("Either it's hot or it's raining (or both).")
    } else {
        println("It's neither hot nor rainy.")
    }
}
```

**Output:**
```
It's hot and rainy - it might be humid.
```

## Real-World Example: Simple Weather App

Let's build a simple function that provides clothing recommendations based on weather conditions:

```kotlin
fun getClothingRecommendation(temperature: Int, isRaining: Boolean, isWindy: Boolean): String {
    return if (temperature > 30) {
        if (isRaining) {
            "Wear light clothes and take an umbrella."
        } else {
            "Wear light clothes, apply sunscreen, and take water."
        }
    } else if (temperature > 20) {
        if (isRaining) {
            "A light jacket and umbrella would be good."
        } else if (isWindy) {
            "A light jacket is recommended due to the wind."
        } else {
            "A t-shirt should be fine."
        }
    } else if (temperature > 10) {
        if (isRaining && isWindy) {
            "Wear a waterproof jacket and warm clothes."
        } else if (isRaining) {
            "Take a jacket and umbrella."
        } else {
            "A jacket or sweater should be enough."
        }
    } else {
        if (isRaining || isWindy) {
            "Wear a heavy coat, and take an umbrella if it's raining."
        } else {
            "Wear a warm coat today."
        }
    }
}

fun main() {
    val currentTemp = 22
    val isRaining = true
    val isWindy = false
    
    val recommendation = getClothingRecommendation(currentTemp, isRaining, isWindy)
    println("Weather advice: $recommendation")
}
```

**Output:**
```
Weather advice: A light jacket and umbrella would be good.
```

## Summary

Kotlin's `if-else` statements provide a flexible way to control the flow of your program based on conditions:

- **Simple if**: Execute code only if a condition is true
- **if-else**: Execute one block if the condition is true, another if it's false
- **if-else if-else chains**: Test multiple conditions in sequence
- **if as an expression**: Return values based on conditions (replacing ternary operators)
- **Nested if statements**: Create complex decision trees
- **Logical operators**: Combine multiple conditions for complex logic

Remember to keep your conditions clear and avoid overly complex nesting to keep your code readable.
