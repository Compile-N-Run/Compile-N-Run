# Kotlin For Loop

Loops are fundamental programming constructs that allow us to execute a block of code repeatedly. In Kotlin, the `for` loop provides a clean and concise way to iterate over collections, ranges, and other iterables. Unlike other languages like Java or C++, Kotlin's `for` loop is designed to be more readable and less error-prone.

## Basic Syntax of For Loop

In Kotlin, the basic syntax of a `for` loop is:

```kotlin
for (item in collection) {
    // code to be executed for each item
}
```

Where:
- `item` is a variable that will hold the current element from the collection during each iteration
- `collection` is any object that provides an iterator (arrays, lists, ranges, etc.)

## Iterating Over Ranges

One of the most common uses of `for` loops is to iterate over a range of numbers. In Kotlin, you can create a range using the `..` operator.

### Example: Iterating Through a Number Range

```kotlin
fun main() {
    // Printing numbers from 1 to 5
    for (number in 1..5) {
        println("Number: $number")
    }
}
```

**Output:**
```
Number: 1
Number: 2
Number: 3
Number: 4
Number: 5
```

### Iterating in Reverse

To iterate in reverse order, you can use the `downTo` function:

```kotlin
fun main() {
    // Printing numbers from 5 down to 1
    for (number in 5 downTo 1) {
        println("Number: $number")
    }
}
```

**Output:**
```
Number: 5
Number: 4
Number: 3
Number: 2
Number: 1
```

### Specifying a Step

You can specify the step (increment or decrement) using the `step` function:

```kotlin
fun main() {
    // Printing even numbers from 2 to 10
    for (number in 2..10 step 2) {
        println("Even number: $number")
    }
    
    // Printing every third number counting down from 10 to 1
    for (number in 10 downTo 1 step 3) {
        println("Countdown: $number")
    }
}
```

**Output:**
```
Even number: 2
Even number: 4
Even number: 6
Even number: 8
Even number: 10
Countdown: 10
Countdown: 7
Countdown: 4
Countdown: 1
```

## Iterating Over Collections

Kotlin's `for` loop makes it easy to iterate over any collection like arrays, lists, sets, and maps.

### Example: Iterating Through an Array

```kotlin
fun main() {
    val fruits = arrayOf("Apple", "Banana", "Cherry", "Date", "Elderberry")
    
    for (fruit in fruits) {
        println("I like $fruit")
    }
}
```

**Output:**
```
I like Apple
I like Banana
I like Cherry
I like Date
I like Elderberry
```

### Example: Iterating Through a List

```kotlin
fun main() {
    val vegetables = listOf("Carrot", "Broccoli", "Spinach", "Tomato")
    
    for (vegetable in vegetables) {
        println("$vegetable is healthy")
    }
}
```

**Output:**
```
Carrot is healthy
Broccoli is healthy
Spinach is healthy
Tomato is healthy
```

## Accessing Indices During Iteration

Sometimes you need to access both the index and the value during iteration. Kotlin provides the `withIndex()` function for this purpose:

```kotlin
fun main() {
    val colors = listOf("Red", "Green", "Blue", "Yellow")
    
    for ((index, color) in colors.withIndex()) {
        println("Color at position $index is $color")
    }
}
```

**Output:**
```
Color at position 0 is Red
Color at position 1 is Green
Color at position 2 is Blue
Color at position 3 is Yellow
```

## Iterating Over Characters in a String

You can iterate through each character in a string using a `for` loop:

```kotlin
fun main() {
    val greeting = "Hello"
    
    for (char in greeting) {
        println("Character: $char")
    }
}
```

**Output:**
```
Character: H
Character: e
Character: l
Character: l
Character: o
```

## Iterating Over Maps

When iterating over maps, you can access both the key and value:

```kotlin
fun main() {
    val capitalCities = mapOf(
        "USA" to "Washington D.C.",
        "UK" to "London",
        "India" to "New Delhi",
        "Australia" to "Canberra"
    )
    
    for ((country, capital) in capitalCities) {
        println("The capital of $country is $capital")
    }
}
```

**Output:**
```
The capital of USA is Washington D.C.
The capital of UK is London
The capital of India is New Delhi
The capital of Australia is Canberra
```

## Using the `until` Function

If you want to exclude the upper bound in a range, you can use the `until` function:

```kotlin
fun main() {
    // Prints numbers from 1 to 4 (excludes 5)
    for (number in 1 until 5) {
        println("Number: $number")
    }
}
```

**Output:**
```
Number: 1
Number: 2
Number: 3
Number: 4
```

## Practical Example: Calculating Factorial

Here's a real-world example of using a `for` loop to calculate the factorial of a number:

```kotlin
fun main() {
    val number = 5
    var factorial = 1
    
    for (i in 1..number) {
        factorial *= i
    }
    
    println("Factorial of $number is $factorial")
}
```

**Output:**
```
Factorial of 5 is 120
```

## Nested For Loops

You can nest `for` loops to work with multi-dimensional data structures:

```kotlin
fun main() {
    // Creating a multiplication table
    for (i in 1..5) {
        for (j in 1..5) {
            print("${i * j}\t")
        }
        println() // Move to the next line after each row
    }
}
```

**Output:**
```
1	2	3	4	5	
2	4	6	8	10	
3	6	9	12	15	
4	8	12	16	20	
5	10	15	20	25	
```

## Breaking and Continuing in For Loops

### Using `break`

The `break` statement lets you exit a loop early:

```kotlin
fun main() {
    val numbers = listOf(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10)
    
    println("Numbers until we find 6:")
    for (number in numbers) {
        if (number == 6) {
            break // Exit the loop when we find 6
        }
        println(number)
    }
}
```

**Output:**
```
Numbers until we find 6:
1
2
3
4
5
```

### Using `continue`

The `continue` statement skips the current iteration and proceeds to the next one:

```kotlin
fun main() {
    println("Odd numbers between 1 and 10:")
    for (number in 1..10) {
        if (number % 2 == 0) {
            continue // Skip even numbers
        }
        println(number)
    }
}
```

**Output:**
```
Odd numbers between 1 and 10:
1
3
5
7
9
```

## Labeling For Loops

When working with nested loops, you can use labels to break or continue from a specific loop:

```kotlin
fun main() {
    outerLoop@ for (i in 1..3) {
        for (j in 1..3) {
            if (i == 2 && j == 2) {
                break@outerLoop // Breaks the outer loop
            }
            println("i = $i, j = $j")
        }
    }
}
```

**Output:**
```
i = 1, j = 1
i = 1, j = 2
i = 1, j = 3
i = 2, j = 1
```

## Summary

Kotlin's `for` loop is a powerful and flexible tool for iterating over various types of data structures:

- Use `for` loops to iterate over ranges, collections, strings, and maps
- Range operators: `..` (inclusive), `until` (exclusive), `downTo`, and `step`
- Access indices with `withIndex()`
- Control loop execution with `break` and `continue`
- Label loops when working with nested structures

The `for` loop is just one of several control flow structures in Kotlin. When combined with other control flow statements like `if`, `when`, and `while`, you can create sophisticated and efficient programs.

## Exercises

To practice using Kotlin's `for` loops, try these exercises:

1. Write a program that prints all the prime numbers between 1 and 50.
2. Create a triangle pattern using nested `for` loops:
   ```
   *
   **
   ***
   ****
   *****
   ```
3. Write a program that iterates through a list of strings and counts how many start with the letter 'A'.
4. Implement FizzBuzz (print "Fizz" for numbers divisible by 3, "Buzz" for numbers divisible by 5, and "FizzBuzz" for numbers divisible by both).
5. Create a program that finds all pairs of numbers in an array that sum to a specified value.
