# Kotlin Do While Loop

## Introduction

In programming, we often need to execute a block of code multiple times. Loops are control flow structures designed specifically for this purpose. The **do-while** loop is a variant of the while loop in Kotlin that guarantees the execution of a code block at least once before checking the condition for subsequent iterations.

Unlike a standard while loop that evaluates the condition before entering the loop, a do-while loop evaluates the condition after executing the loop body for the first time. This key difference makes do-while loops particularly useful when you need to ensure that a block of code runs at least once, regardless of the condition.

## Basic Syntax

Here's the basic syntax of a do-while loop in Kotlin:

```kotlin
do {
    // Code to be executed
} while (condition)
```

The loop works as follows:
1. The code inside the `do` block executes first
2. Then the `condition` is evaluated
3. If the `condition` is `true`, the loop continues and the code inside the `do` block executes again
4. If the `condition` is `false`, the loop terminates

## Simple Do-While Loop Example

Let's start with a basic example that prints numbers from 1 to 5:

```kotlin
fun main() {
    var i = 1
    
    do {
        println("Number: $i")
        i++
    } while (i <= 5)
}
```

**Output:**
```
Number: 1
Number: 2
Number: 3
Number: 4
Number: 5
```

In this example:
- We initialize a variable `i` with the value 1
- Inside the do-while loop, we print the current value of `i` and then increment it
- The loop continues as long as `i` is less than or equal to 5

## Do-While vs. While Loop

To understand the unique characteristic of do-while loops, let's compare it with a regular while loop:

```kotlin
fun main() {
    println("Using while loop:")
    var i = 6
    
    while (i <= 5) {
        println("Number: $i")
        i++
    }
    
    println("\nUsing do-while loop:")
    i = 6
    
    do {
        println("Number: $i")
        i++
    } while (i <= 5)
}
```

**Output:**
```
Using while loop:

Using do-while loop:
Number: 6
```

Notice the difference:
- The while loop body doesn't execute at all because the condition is false from the start
- The do-while loop executes once before checking the condition, so it prints "Number: 6"

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: Input Validation

One common real-world use case for do-while loops is input validation, where you want to ensure that the user provides valid input:

```kotlin
fun main() {
    var userInput: Int
    
    do {
        print("Please enter a positive number: ")
        userInput = readLine()?.toIntOrNull() ?: -1
        
        if (userInput <= 0) {
            println("That's not a positive number. Try again.")
        }
    } while (userInput <= 0)
    
    println("Thank you! You entered: $userInput")
}
```

In this example:
- We keep asking the user for input until they provide a positive number
- The loop guarantees that we ask for input at least once
- We only exit the loop when valid input is provided

### Example 2: Menu-Driven Program

Another practical application is creating menu-driven console applications:

```kotlin
fun main() {
    var choice: Int
    
    do {
        println("\n--- Calculator Menu ---")
        println("1. Add two numbers")
        println("2. Subtract two numbers")
        println("3. Multiply two numbers")
        println("4. Divide two numbers")
        println("5. Exit")
        print("Enter your choice (1-5): ")
        
        choice = readLine()?.toIntOrNull() ?: 0
        
        when (choice) {
            1 -> performAddition()
            2 -> performSubtraction()
            3 -> performMultiplication()
            4 -> performDivision()
            5 -> println("Exiting calculator...")
            else -> println("Invalid choice. Please try again.")
        }
    } while (choice != 5)
}

fun performAddition() {
    print("Enter first number: ")
    val num1 = readLine()?.toDoubleOrNull() ?: 0.0
    print("Enter second number: ")
    val num2 = readLine()?.toDoubleOrNull() ?: 0.0
    println("Result: ${num1 + num2}")
}

// Similar functions for other operations
fun performSubtraction() {
    // Implementation omitted for brevity
    println("Subtraction selected")
}

fun performMultiplication() {
    // Implementation omitted for brevity
    println("Multiplication selected")
}

fun performDivision() {
    // Implementation omitted for brevity
    println("Division selected")
}
```

This example demonstrates a menu-driven calculator where:
- The menu is displayed at least once
- The program continues to show the menu until the user chooses to exit
- The do-while loop creates a continuous interaction cycle

### Example 3: Retry Mechanism

Do-while loops are excellent for implementing retry mechanisms:

```kotlin
fun main() {
    val maxAttempts = 3
    var currentAttempt = 0
    var success = false
    
    do {
        currentAttempt++
        println("Attempt $currentAttempt of $maxAttempts")
        
        // Simulate an operation that might fail
        val randomValue = (1..10).random()
        success = randomValue > 7
        
        if (success) {
            println("Operation succeeded!")
        } else {
            println("Operation failed. Random value was: $randomValue (needed > 7)")
            if (currentAttempt < maxAttempts) {
                println("Retrying...")
            } else {
                println("Maximum attempts reached. Giving up.")
            }
        }
    } while (!success && currentAttempt < maxAttempts)
}
```

This example shows how to implement a retry mechanism that:
- Makes at least one attempt
- Continues trying until either success is achieved or maximum attempts are reached

## Common Pitfalls and Tips

### 1. Infinite Loops

Be careful not to create infinite loops:

```kotlin
// Potential infinite loop if you forget to increment i
do {
    println("This might run forever!")
    // Missing: i++
} while (i < 10)
```

Always ensure your loop has a way to terminate.

### 2. Loop Variables

It's a good practice to initialize loop control variables before the loop:

```kotlin
var counter = 1 // Good: Initialize before the loop
do {
    println("Counter: $counter")
    counter++
} while (counter <= 5)
```

### 3. Loop Condition Evaluation

Remember that in a do-while loop, the condition is evaluated after the loop body executes:

```kotlin
var x = 10
do {
    println("Value of x: $x")
    x -= 5
} while (x > 0)
```

**Output:**
```
Value of x: 10
Value of x: 5
Value of x: 0
```

Note that even though the condition checks for `x > 0`, we still see "Value of x: 0" in the output because the condition is checked after the loop body runs.

## Summary

The do-while loop in Kotlin is a powerful control flow structure that guarantees at least one execution of a code block before checking the condition for subsequent iterations. This makes it particularly useful for:

- Input validation where you need to prompt at least once
- Menu-driven programs that should display at least once
- Retry mechanisms where you want to make at least one attempt
- Any scenario where you need to guarantee that a block of code runs at least once

Key points to remember:
- The loop body always executes at least once
- The condition is checked after each execution of the loop body
- If the condition is true, the loop continues; otherwise, it terminates
- Be careful to avoid infinite loops by ensuring the loop condition can eventually become false

## Exercises for Practice

1. Write a program that uses a do-while loop to sum numbers entered by the user until they enter 0.
2. Create a simple guessing game where the program generates a random number and the user has to guess it. Use a do-while loop to keep prompting the user until they guess correctly.
3. Implement a password validation system that requires users to enter a password that meets certain criteria (e.g., minimum length, contains a digit, etc.). Use a do-while loop to keep asking until a valid password is provided.
4. Create a simple ATM interface using a do-while loop that presents options to the user until they choose to exit.
