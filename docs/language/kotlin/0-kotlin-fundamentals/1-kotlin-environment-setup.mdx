# Kotlin Environment Setup

Before diving into Kotlin programming, you need to set up a proper development environment. This guide will walk you through all the necessary steps to get your Kotlin environment ready for development, from installing the Java Development Kit (JDK) to setting up an Integrated Development Environment (IDE).

## Prerequisites

Kotlin runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), so you'll need to have Java installed on your system before setting up Kotlin.

### Installing the JDK

1. **Download the JDK** - Visit [Oracle's JDK download page](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html) or [OpenJDK](https://adoptopenjdk.net/) and download the appropriate version for your operating system. Kotlin works well with JDK 8 or newer.

2. **Install the JDK** - Follow the installation wizard instructions for your operating system.

3. **Verify installation** - Open a terminal or command prompt and type:

```bash
java -version
```

You should see output similar to:

```
openjdk version "11.0.12" 2021-07-20
OpenJDK Runtime Environment AdoptOpenJDK (build 11.0.12+7)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM AdoptOpenJDK (build 11.0.12+7, mixed mode)
```

### Setting JAVA_HOME Environment Variable

Setting the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable is important for many Java-based tools:

**For Windows:**
1. Right-click on "This PC" or "My Computer" and select "Properties"
2. Click on "Advanced system settings"
3. Click on "Environment Variables"
4. Click "New" under System Variables
5. Enter `JAVA_HOME` as the variable name
6. Enter the path to your JDK installation (e.g., `C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-11.0.12`) as the variable value
7. Add `%JAVA_HOME%\bin` to your system PATH variable

**For macOS/Linux:**
Add these lines to your `~/.bash_profile`, `~/.zshrc`, or appropriate shell configuration file:

```bash
export JAVA_HOME=/path/to/your/jdk
export PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH
```

## Installing the Kotlin Compiler

There are several ways to install the Kotlin compiler:

### Option 1: Using SDKMAN (Linux/macOS)

SDKMAN is a tool for managing parallel versions of multiple Software Development Kits:

```bash
# Install SDKMAN
curl -s "https://get.sdkman.io" | bash
source "$HOME/.sdkman/bin/sdkman-init.sh"

# Install Kotlin
sdk install kotlin
```

Verify the installation:

```bash
kotlin -version
```

### Option 2: Using Homebrew (macOS)

```bash
brew update
brew install kotlin
```

### Option 3: Manual Installation

1. Download the Kotlin compiler from the [Kotlin GitHub releases page](https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin/releases/latest)
2. Extract the downloaded zip file to a directory
3. Add the `bin` directory to your system PATH

## Setting up an IDE

While you can write and compile Kotlin code using any text editor and the command line, an IDE provides numerous features that make development easier and more efficient.

### IntelliJ IDEA (Recommended)

JetBrains, the company behind Kotlin, also develops IntelliJ IDEA, which offers the best support for Kotlin development.

1. **Download and Install** - Download [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/) (either the Community or Ultimate editionâ€”Community is free and sufficient for Kotlin development)

2. **Installation** - Run the installer and follow the instructions

3. **Kotlin Plugin** - The Kotlin plugin comes bundled with IntelliJ IDEA, but you can verify it's enabled:
   - Go to `File > Settings > Plugins` (on Windows/Linux) or `IntelliJ IDEA > Preferences > Plugins` (on macOS)
   - Search for "Kotlin" and ensure it's installed and enabled

### Other IDEs

**Android Studio:**
Android Studio, based on IntelliJ IDEA, also comes with Kotlin support built-in. It's perfect if you're planning to develop Android applications.

**Eclipse:**
To use Kotlin with Eclipse:
1. Go to `Help > Eclipse Marketplace`
2. Search for "Kotlin" and install the "Kotlin Plugin for Eclipse"

**Visual Studio Code:**
1. Install the [Kotlin Language extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mathiasfrohlich.Kotlin) from the marketplace
2. Optionally, install the [Code Runner extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=formulahendry.code-runner) to execute Kotlin code directly from VS Code

## Creating Your First Kotlin Project

Let's create a simple "Hello World" program to verify your setup:

### Using IntelliJ IDEA:

1. Open IntelliJ IDEA
2. Click on `File > New > Project`
3. Select "Kotlin" from the left panel
4. Choose "Kotlin/JVM" and click "Next"
5. Name your project (e.g., "HelloKotlin") and click "Finish"
6. Right-click on the `src` folder, select `New > Kotlin File/Class`
7. Name it "HelloWorld" and press Enter
8. Add the following code:

```kotlin
fun main() {
    println("Hello, Kotlin!")
}
```

9. Right-click anywhere in the editor and select "Run 'HelloWorldKt'"

You should see the output:
```
Hello, Kotlin!
```

### Using Command Line:

1. Create a file named `HelloWorld.kt` with the following content:

```kotlin
fun main() {
    println("Hello, Kotlin!")
}
```

2. Compile the code:

```bash
kotlinc HelloWorld.kt -include-runtime -d HelloWorld.jar
```

3. Run the compiled program:

```bash
java -jar HelloWorld.jar
```

You should see the output:
```
Hello, Kotlin!
```

## Understanding the Project Structure

When you create a Kotlin project in an IDE like IntelliJ IDEA, several directories and files are created:

- `src/`: Contains your source code
- `out/` or `build/`: Contains compiled bytecode
- `.idea/`: IntelliJ IDEA-specific configuration files
- `project_name.iml`: IntelliJ IDEA module file
- `build.gradle` or `pom.xml`: If you're using Gradle or Maven for build management

## Setting Up Build Tools

For larger projects, you'll want to use a build system like Gradle or Maven.

### Using Gradle with Kotlin

1. Create a `build.gradle.kts` file in your project root:

```kotlin
plugins {
    kotlin("jvm") version "1.6.10"
    application
}

group = "org.example"
version = "1.0-SNAPSHOT"

repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}

dependencies {
    implementation(kotlin("stdlib"))
    testImplementation(kotlin("test"))
}

application {
    mainClass.set("MainKt")
}
```

2. Create a Kotlin file in `src/main/kotlin/Main.kt`:

```kotlin
fun main() {
    println("Hello, Gradle with Kotlin!")
}
```

3. Run the application:

```bash
./gradlew run
```
