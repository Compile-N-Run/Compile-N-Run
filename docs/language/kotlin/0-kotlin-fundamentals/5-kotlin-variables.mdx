# Kotlin Variables

Variables are one of the most fundamental concepts in programming. They serve as containers for storing data values that can be used and manipulated throughout your program. In this tutorial, we'll explore how variables work in Kotlin and what makes them unique compared to other programming languages.

## Introduction to Variables in Kotlin

In Kotlin, variables are particularly flexible and powerful due to the language's modern design. Kotlin variables have two key characteristics that make them stand out:

1. **Type inference** - Kotlin can automatically determine variable types
2. **Immutability options** - Kotlin lets you choose between mutable and immutable variables

Let's dive into these concepts and see how variables work in practice.

## Declaring Variables in Kotlin

Kotlin provides two main keywords for declaring variables:

- `val` - for immutable variables (cannot be reassigned)
- `var` - for mutable variables (can be reassigned)

### Using `val` for Immutable Variables

When you want to create a variable whose value cannot be changed after initialization, use the `val` keyword:

```kotlin
val name = "John"
val age = 30
val isStudent = false
```

Once defined, you cannot reassign a value to a `val` variable:

```kotlin
val score = 100
// score = 200  // This would cause a compilation error
```

### Using `var` for Mutable Variables

When you need a variable that can be changed later in the program, use the `var` keyword:

```kotlin
var counter = 0
counter = 1      // This is perfectly fine
counter = 2      // We can change it as many times as needed
```

Here's a complete example showing the difference:

```kotlin
fun main() {
    val constantValue = 100
    var changingValue = 100
    
    // constantValue = 200  // Error: Val cannot be reassigned
    changingValue = 200     // This works fine
    
    println("Constant value: $constantValue")
    println("Changing value: $changingValue")
}
```

Output:
```
Constant value: 100
Changing value: 200
```

## Type Inference and Explicit Type Declaration

Kotlin has a powerful type inference system that can automatically determine the type of a variable from the value it's initialized with.

### Implicit Type Declaration (Type Inference)

In most cases, you don't need to specify the type explicitly:

```kotlin
val name = "Alice"    // Compiler infers that name is a String
val age = 25          // Compiler infers that age is an Int
val pi = 3.14         // Compiler infers that pi is a Double
```

### Explicit Type Declaration

You can also explicitly declare the type if needed:

```kotlin
val name: String = "Bob"
val age: Int = 30
val temperature: Double = 98.6
```

This becomes necessary when initializing a variable later or when you want to be explicit about the type:

```kotlin
val message: String  // Type is required when not initializing immediately
// Some code...
message = "Hello"    // Initialization happens later
```

## Variable Initialization

In Kotlin, variables need to be initialized before use. This helps prevent null pointer exceptions and makes your code safer.

### Immediate Initialization

The most common approach is to initialize variables when declaring them:

```kotlin
val userId = 1001
var score = 0
```

### Deferred Initialization

Sometimes you might want to declare a variable first and initialize it later:

```kotlin
val response: String
if (isSuccess) {
    response = "Operation completed successfully"
} else {
    response = "Operation failed"
}
println(response) // The compiler knows response is initialized at this point
```

For more complex scenarios, Kotlin provides several mechanisms:

#### lateinit (for var only)

The `lateinit` modifier allows you to avoid initializing a non-null variable at the point of declaration:

```kotlin
lateinit var userInput: String

fun processInput() {
    userInput = readLine() ?: ""
    println("You entered: $userInput")
}
```

#### lazy initialization (for val)

For immutable variables, you can use lazy initialization:

```kotlin
val expensiveData: List<String> by lazy {
    println("Computing expensive data...")
    loadDataFromDatabase() // This runs only when expensiveData is accessed
}

fun main() {
    println("Program started")
    println("Data size: ${expensiveData.size}") // First access triggers initialization
    println("Data first element: ${expensiveData[0]}") // No initialization here
}
```

## Variable Scope

The scope of a variable defines where in the code the variable can be accessed.

### Local Variables

Variables declared within a function or block are only accessible within that function or block:

```kotlin
fun calculateArea() {
    val width = 10
    val height = 5
    val area = width * height
    println("The area is $area")
}

// width, height, and area are not accessible here
```

### Top-Level Variables

Variables declared at the top level of a file are accessible throughout the file:

```kotlin
val MAX_COUNT = 100 // A top-level variable

fun incrementCounter(counter: Int): Int {
    return if (counter < MAX_COUNT) counter + 1 else counter
}
```

## Constants in Kotlin

For true constants in Kotlin, you can use the `const` modifier along with `val`. The `const` modifier can only be used with primitive types and String:

```kotlin
const val MAX_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS = 3
const val API_KEY = "abc123xyz456"
```

These are compile-time constants and are more efficient than regular immutable variables.

## Practical Examples

Let's look at some real-world applications of variables in Kotlin:

### User Profile Management

```kotlin
fun main() {
    // User profile information
    val userId: Long = 12345
    val username: String = "kotlin_lover"
    var email: String = "user@example.com"
    var experiencePoints: Int = 100
    val accountCreationDate: String = "2023-01-15"
    var isPremiumUser: Boolean = false
    
    // Updating mutable information
    email = "new.email@example.com"
    experiencePoints += 50
    isPremiumUser = true
    
    // Display user profile
    println("User Profile:")
    println("ID: $userId")
    println("Username: $username")
    println("Email: $email")
    println("XP: $experiencePoints")
    println("Member since: $accountCreationDate")
    println("Premium user: $isPremiumUser")
}
```

Output:
```
User Profile:
ID: 12345
Username: kotlin_lover
Email: new.email@example.com
XP: 150
Member since: 2023-01-15
Premium user: true
```

### Temperature Converter

```kotlin
fun main() {
    val temperatureInCelsius = 25.0
    
    // Convert to Fahrenheit: (C × 9/5) + 32
    val temperatureInFahrenheit = (temperatureInCelsius * 9/5) + 32
    
    // Convert to Kelvin: C + 273.15
    val temperatureInKelvin = temperatureInCelsius + 273.15
    
    println("Temperature conversion results:")
    println("$temperatureInCelsius°C = $temperatureInFahrenheit°F")
    println("$temperatureInCelsius°C = $temperatureInKelvin K")
}
```

Output:
```
Temperature conversion results:
25.0°C = 77.0°F
25.0°C = 298.15 K
```

### Shopping Cart Total Calculator

```kotlin
fun main() {
    // Product prices
    val breadPrice = 2.99
    val milkPrice = 1.79
    val eggsPrice = 3.49
    
    // Quantities
    var breadQuantity = 2
    var milkQuantity = 1
    var eggsQuantity = 2
    
    // Calculate initial subtotal
    var subtotal = (breadPrice * breadQuantity) + 
                   (milkPrice * milkQuantity) + 
                   (eggsPrice * eggsQuantity)
    
    // Apply discount if subtotal is over $10
    val discountThreshold = 10.0
    val discountRate = 0.1 // 10% discount
    
    var discount = 0.0
    if (subtotal >= discountThreshold) {
        discount = subtotal * discountRate
    }
    
    // Calculate final total
    val total = subtotal - discount
    
    // Print receipt
    println("SHOPPING CART")
    println("-------------")
    println("Bread ($breadQuantity) : $${breadPrice * breadQuantity}")
    println("Milk ($milkQuantity)  : $${milkPrice * milkQuantity}")
    println("Eggs ($eggsQuantity)  : $${eggsPrice * eggsQuantity}")
    println("-------------")
    println("Subtotal    : $$subtotal")
    println("Discount    : $$discount")
    println("Total       : $$total")
}
```

Output:
```
SHOPPING CART
-------------
Bread (2) : $5.98
Milk (1)  : $1.79
Eggs (2)  : $6.98
-------------
Subtotal    : $14.75
Discount    : $1.475
Total       : $13.275
```

## Best Practices for Using Variables in Kotlin

1. **Prefer `val` over `var`**: Use immutable variables (`val`) whenever possible. This leads to more predictable code with fewer side effects.

2. **Use meaningful variable names**: Choose names that clearly describe the purpose of the variable.

3. **Use type inference**: Let Kotlin infer the types unless you have a specific reason to declare them explicitly.

4. **Initialize variables when declaring them**: When possible, provide an initial value at the point of declaration.

5. **Use the most specific type needed**: Select the appropriate data type for your variables to ensure type safety.

6. **Keep variable scope as limited as possible**: Declare variables in the narrowest scope needed to minimize exposure.

## Summary

In Kotlin, variables provide a way to store and manipulate data. The key points covered in this tutorial include:

- Using `val` for immutable variables and `var` for mutable ones
- Leveraging Kotlin's type inference system
- Declaring variables with explicit types when needed
