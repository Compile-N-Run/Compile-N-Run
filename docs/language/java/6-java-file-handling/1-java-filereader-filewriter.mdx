# Java FileReader and FileWriter

## Introduction

In Java programming, working with files is an essential skill. When it comes to reading from and writing to text files, Java provides dedicated classes: `FileReader` and `FileWriter`. These classes are character-oriented stream classes that make it easy to handle text data.

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to:
- Read text from files using `FileReader`
- Write text to files using `FileWriter`
- Handle exceptions during file operations
- Implement common file handling patterns

Let's explore how these classes can help you manage text data in your Java applications!

## Understanding Character Streams

Before diving into `FileReader` and `FileWriter`, it's important to understand character streams in Java.

```mermaid

    A[Java I/O] --> B[Byte Streams]
    A --> C[Character Streams]
    C --> D[Reader Classes]
    C --> E[Writer Classes]
    D --> F[FileReader]
    E --> G[FileWriter]
```

- **Byte Streams**: Handle raw binary data (bytes)
- **Character Streams**: Handle text data (characters)

`FileReader` and `FileWriter` are character streams that:
- Automatically handle character encoding
- Process text one character at a time
- Are ideal for text files (not binary files like images)

## Using FileReader to Read Text Files

The `FileReader` class allows you to read character data from files. It reads bytes from a file and converts them to characters using the system's default character encoding.

### Basic Syntax

Here's the basic pattern for using `FileReader`:

```java
try (FileReader reader = new FileReader("path/to/file.txt")) {
    // Read operations
} catch (IOException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}
```

### Reading Characters One by One

Let's look at a simple example that reads a text file character by character:

```java
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;

public class FileReaderExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try (FileReader reader = new FileReader("sample.txt")) {
            int character;
            // Read characters until the end of file
            while ((character = reader.read()) != -1) {
                System.out.print((char) character);
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.out.println("An error occurred while reading the file: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```

Assuming `sample.txt` contains:
```
Hello, 
This is a sample text file.
Welcome to Java file handling!
```

Output:
```
Hello, 
This is a sample text file.
Welcome to Java file handling!
```

### Reading Multiple Characters at Once

A more efficient approach is to read blocks of characters at a time:

```java
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;

public class FileReaderBufferExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try (FileReader reader = new FileReader("sample.txt")) {
            char[] buffer = new char[1024]; // Buffer to store characters
            int charsRead;
            
            // Read up to 1024 characters at a time
            while ((charsRead = reader.read(buffer)) != -1) {
                // Convert the read characters to a string and print
                System.out.print(new String(buffer, 0, charsRead));
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.out.println("An error occurred: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```

This approach is more efficient because it reduces the number of method calls to read data.

## Using FileWriter to Write Text Files

The `FileWriter` class allows you to write character data to files. It converts characters to bytes using the default character encoding and writes them to the file.

### Basic Syntax

Here's the basic pattern for using `FileWriter`:

```java
try (FileWriter writer = new FileWriter("path/to/file.txt")) {
    // Write operations
} catch (IOException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}
```

### Writing Text to a File

Let's create a simple example that writes text to a file:

```java
import java.io.FileWriter;
import java.io.IOException;

public class FileWriterExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try (FileWriter writer = new FileWriter("output.txt")) {
            writer.write("Hello, this is a test file.\n");
            writer.write("Writing to files in Java is easy!\n");
            writer.write("End of file.");
            System.out.println("Data written to file successfully!");
        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.out.println("An error occurred while writing to the file: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```

After running this code, the file `output.txt` will be created (or overwritten if it already exists) with the following content:

```
Hello, this is a test file.
Writing to files in Java is easy!
End of file.
```

### Appending to Existing Files

By default, `FileWriter` overwrites the existing file. To append data to an existing file, use the append parameter in the constructor:

```java
import java.io.FileWriter;
import java.io.IOException;

public class FileWriterAppendExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try (FileWriter writer = new FileWriter("output.txt", true)) {  // true enables append mode
            writer.write("\nThis line is appended to the file.");
            System.out.println("Data appended to file successfully!");
        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.out.println("An error occurred while appending to the file: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```

Now `output.txt` will contain:

```
Hello, this is a test file.
Writing to files in Java is easy!
End of file.
This line is appended to the file.
```

## Handling Exceptions in File Operations

File operations can fail for various reasons, such as:
- The file doesn't exist (when reading)
- No permission to access the file
- Disk space issues (when writing)

Always use proper exception handling with file operations. The try-with-resources statement (used in the examples above) is recommended because it automatically closes the resources, even if an exception occurs.

## Practical Examples

Let's explore some practical examples of using `FileReader` and `FileWriter` together.

### Example 1: Copy Text File Contents

This program copies the contents from one text file to another:

```java
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.FileWriter;
import java.io.IOException;

public class FileCopyExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try (FileReader reader = new FileReader("source.txt");
             FileWriter writer = new FileWriter("destination.txt")) {
            
            char[] buffer = new char[1024];
            int charsRead;
            
            while ((charsRead = reader.read(buffer)) != -1) {
                writer.write(buffer, 0, charsRead);
            }
            
            System.out.println("File copied successfully!");
        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.out.println("An error occurred: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```

### Example 2: Word Count Program

This program counts words, lines, and characters in a text file:

```java
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;

public class WordCountExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int charCount = 0;
        int wordCount = 0;
        int lineCount = 0;
        
        try (FileReader reader = new FileReader("sample.txt")) {
            int character;
            boolean isWord = false;
            
            while ((character = reader.read()) != -1) {
                charCount++;
                
                // Check for new line
                if (character == '\n') {
                    lineCount++;
                }
                
                // Check for word
                if (Character.isWhitespace(character)) {
                    isWord = false;
                } else if (!isWord) {
                    isWord = true;
                    wordCount++;
                }
            }
            
            // Count the last line if file doesn't end with a newline
            if (charCount > 0 && lineCount == 0) {
                lineCount = 1;
            }
            
            System.out.println("Characters: " + charCount);
            System.out.println("Words: " + wordCount);
            System.out.println("Lines: " + lineCount);
            
        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.out.println("An error occurred: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```

### Example 3: Log File Creator

This program demonstrates how to create and append to a log file:

```java
import java.io.FileWriter;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.time.LocalDateTime;
import java.time.format.DateTimeFormatter;

public class LogFileExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            log("Application started");
            // Simulate some application events
            Thread.sleep(1000);
            log("Processing data");
            Thread.sleep(1000);
            log("Application finished");
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            log("Application interrupted: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
    
    public static void log(String message) {
        try (FileWriter writer = new FileWriter("application.log", true)) {
            LocalDateTime now = LocalDateTime.now();
            String timestamp = now.format(DateTimeFormatter.ofPattern("yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss"));
            writer.write(timestamp + " - " + message + "\n");
        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.err.println("Failed to write to log file: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```

This creates a log file with timestamps for each entry:

```
2023-10-20 14:25:30 - Application started
2023-10-20 14:25:31 - Processing data
2023-10-20 14:25:32 - Application finished
```

## Limitations and Best Practices

While `FileReader` and `FileWriter` are useful for simple file operations, they have some limitations:

1. **Character Encoding**: They use the system's default character encoding. For specific encodings, use `InputStreamReader` and `OutputStreamWriter` with `FileInputStream` and `FileOutputStream`.

2. **Performance**: For better performance with large files, wrap them with `BufferedReader` and `BufferedWriter`.

3. **Error Handling**: Always use try-with-resources statements to ensure resources are properly closed.

4. **Binary Files**: These classes are not suitable for binary files. Use `FileInputStream` and `FileOutputStream` instead.

## Enhanced File Operations with BufferedReader and BufferedWriter

For better performance, especially when dealing with larger files, combine `FileReader` and `FileWriter` with buffered classes:

```java
import java.io.*;

public class BufferedFileExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try (BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("input.txt"));
             BufferedWriter writer = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter("output.txt"))) {
            
            String line;
            while ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) {
                writer.write(line);
                writer.newLine(); // Add a line separator
            }
            
            System.out.println("File processing completed.");
        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.out.println("An error occurred: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```

The buffered classes improve performance by:
- Reading/writing chunks of characters at a time
- Reducing the number of actual I/O operations
- Providing additional convenient methods like `readLine()`
