# Java Type Casting

Type casting in Java is a method of changing a variable from one data type to another. Understanding type casting is essential for Java programming as it allows you to convert data between different types when needed.

## Introduction to Type Casting

In Java, variables have specific data types that determine what kind of values they can hold. Sometimes, you need to convert a value from one type to another. This conversion process is called type casting.

There are two main types of casting in Java:

1. **Implicit Casting (Widening)**: Automatically done by the Java compiler when converting a smaller data type to a larger one
2. **Explicit Casting (Narrowing)**: Manually done by the programmer when converting a larger data type to a smaller one

Let's explore both types in detail.

## Implicit Casting (Widening Conversion)

Implicit casting occurs when a smaller data type is automatically converted to a larger data type. This conversion is safe because there's no risk of data loss.

The automatic type conversion follows this hierarchy:

    byte --> short
    short --> int
    int --> long
    long --> float
    float --> double
    char --> int
```

### Example of Implicit Casting

```java
public class ImplicitCastingExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Implicit casting from int to double
        int numInt = 10;
        double numDouble = numInt; // Automatic casting from int to double
        
        System.out.println("Integer value: " + numInt);
        System.out.println("Double value after casting: " + numDouble);
        
        // Implicit casting in expressions
        byte b = 42;
        short s = 1024;
        int i = 50000;
        long l = 1000000L;
        float f = 5.67f;
        double d = 0.1234;
        
        // Expression evaluation causes implicit casting
        double result = (f * b) + (i / s) - (d * l);
        
        System.out.println("Result of the expression: " + result);
    }
}
```

**Output:**
```
Integer value: 10
Double value after casting: 10.0
Result of the expression: 237.9766
```

In this example, the `int` value is implicitly cast to a `double`. In the expression, all values are automatically promoted following the conversion hierarchy.

## Explicit Casting (Narrowing Conversion)

Explicit casting is necessary when you want to convert a larger data type to a smaller data type. Since this might result in data loss, Java requires you to explicitly state your intention to cast.

### Syntax for Explicit Casting

```java
(target_type) expression
```

### Example of Explicit Casting

```java
public class ExplicitCastingExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Explicit casting from double to int
        double numDouble = 10.99;
        int numInt = (int) numDouble; // Explicit casting
        
        System.out.println("Double value: " + numDouble);
        System.out.println("Integer value after casting: " + numInt);
        
        // Potential data loss example
        int largeValue = 130;
        byte smallValue = (byte) largeValue;
        
        System.out.println("Original large value: " + largeValue);
        System.out.println("Value after casting to byte: " + smallValue);
    }
}
```

**Output:**
```
Double value: 10.99
Integer value after casting: 10
Original large value: 130
Value after casting to byte: -126
```

Notice that when casting from `double` to `int`, the decimal part is truncated (not rounded). Also, when casting from `int` to `byte`, the value wraps around since a byte can only store values from -128 to 127.

## Type Casting with Objects (Reference Types)

In Java, object references can also be cast. This is different from primitive type casting and involves the inheritance hierarchy.

### Upcasting

Upcasting is the process of casting a reference from a subclass type to a superclass type. This is always safe and happens implicitly.

```java
public class TypeCastingWithObjects {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Upcasting example
        Dog dog = new Dog();
        Animal animal = dog; // Implicit upcasting
        
        animal.makeSound(); // This calls Dog's implementation of makeSound()
    }
}

class Animal {
    public void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Animal makes a sound");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    @Override
    public void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }
    
    public void wagTail() {
        System.out.println("Dog wags tail");
    }
}
```

**Output:**
```
Dog barks
```

### Downcasting

Downcasting is the process of casting a reference from a superclass type to a subclass type. This requires explicit casting and should be used with caution.

```java
public class DowncastingExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Proper downcasting
        Animal animal1 = new Dog(); // Upcasting
        Dog dog = (Dog) animal1;    // Downcasting
        
        dog.makeSound();
        dog.wagTail();  // Now we can call Dog-specific methods
        
        // Incorrect downcasting - will cause ClassCastException
        try {
            Animal animal2 = new Animal();
            Dog impossibleDog = (Dog) animal2; // Will throw ClassCastException
        } catch (ClassCastException e) {
            System.out.println("Cannot cast Animal to Dog if it's not actually a Dog");
        }
        
        // Using instanceof to prevent ClassCastException
        Animal someAnimal = new Animal();
        if (someAnimal instanceof Dog) {
            Dog safeDog = (Dog) someAnimal;
            safeDog.wagTail();
        } else {
            System.out.println("This animal is not a dog");
        }
    }
}
```

**Output:**
```
Dog barks
Dog wags tail
Cannot cast Animal to Dog if it's not actually a Dog
This animal is not a dog
```

## Practical Applications of Type Casting

### 1. Working with User Input

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class UserInputCasting {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        
        System.out.print("Enter a decimal number: ");
        String input = scanner.nextLine();
        
        // Converting string to double
        double doubleValue = Double.parseDouble(input);
        
        // Converting to various types with casting
        int intValue = (int) doubleValue;
        long longValue = (long) doubleValue;
        float floatValue = (float) doubleValue;
        
        System.out.println("As double: " + doubleValue);
        System.out.println("As int: " + intValue);
        System.out.println("As long: " + longValue);
        System.out.println("As float: " + floatValue);
        
        scanner.close();
    }
}
```

**Sample Output (for input "42.75"):**
```
Enter a decimal number: 42.75
As double: 42.75
As int: 42
As long: 42
As float: 42.75
```

### 2. Mathematical Operations

```java
public class MathOperationsWithCasting {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int a = 5;
        int b = 2;
        
        // Without casting - integer division
        int resultWithoutCast = a / b;
        System.out.println("5/2 without casting: " + resultWithoutCast);
        
        // With casting - floating point division
        double resultWithCast = (double) a / b;
        System.out.println("5/2 with casting: " + resultWithCast);
        
        // Calculating average of integers
        int[] scores = {85, 92, 78, 95, 88};
        int sum = 0;
        
        for (int score : scores) {
            sum += score;
        }
        
        double average = (double) sum / scores.length;
        System.out.println("Average score: " + average);
    }
}
```

**Output:**
```
5/2 without casting: 2
5/2 with casting: 2.5
Average score: 87.6
```

### 3. Working with APIs and Libraries

Many Java APIs use type casting when working with collections and generic types:

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class CollectionsAndCasting {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Creating a list of integers
        List<Integer> numbers = new ArrayList<>();
        numbers.add(10);
        numbers.add(20);
        numbers.add(30);
        
        // Using raw type (old code) might require casting
        List oldStyleList = numbers;  // Raw type
        Integer firstNumber = (Integer) oldStyleList.get(0);  // Requires cast
        
        System.out.println("First number: " + firstNumber);
        
        // Modern approach with generics doesn't require explicit casting
        List<Integer> modernList = numbers;
        Integer secondNumber = modernList.get(1);  // No cast needed
        
        System.out.println("Second number: " + secondNumber);
        
        // Working with Object type often requires casting
        Object obj = "Hello, World!";
        if (obj instanceof String) {
            String str = (String) obj;
            System.out.println("String length: " + str.length());
        }
    }
}
```

**Output:**
```
First number: 10
Second number: 20
String length: 13
```

## Best Practices for Type Casting in Java

1. **Always use implicit casting when possible** to avoid potential data loss
2. **Use `instanceof` operator before downcasting objects** to avoid `ClassCastException`
3. **Be aware of potential data loss** when performing narrowing conversions
4. **Consider using wrapper class methods** like `Integer.parseInt()` or `Double.parseDouble()` when converting between strings and numeric types
5. **Understand autoboxing and unboxing** when working with primitive types and their wrapper classes

## Common Pitfalls and Errors

### 1. ClassCastException

```java
Object obj = new Integer(10);
String str = (String) obj;  // Throws ClassCastException
```

### 2. Loss of Precision

```java
double pi = 3.14159;
int intPi = (int) pi;  // intPi becomes 3, losing the decimal part
```

### 3. Integer Overflow

```java
int largeInt = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
short smallShort = (short) largeInt;  // Overflow occurs
```

## Exercises

1. Write a program that takes a double input from the user and displays its integer part and fractional part separately.
2. Create a class hierarchy with at least three levels (e.g., Animal → Mammal → Dog) and practice upcasting and downcasting between them.
3. Write a function that safely converts between different numeric types while handling potential errors.
4. Create a program that demonstrates the difference between `==` and `equals()` when comparing objects after casting.
