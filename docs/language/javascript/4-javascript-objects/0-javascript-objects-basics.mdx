# JavaScript Objects Basics

## Introduction

Objects are one of the core data structures in JavaScript. Unlike primitive data types (numbers, strings, booleans), objects allow you to store collections of data with key-value pairs. Think of objects as containers that can hold multiple related values, similar to how a physical container might hold different items.

In this tutorial, you'll learn:
- What JavaScript objects are and why they're important
- Different ways to create objects
- How to access, modify, and delete object properties
- Common operations and methods for working with objects

## What is a JavaScript Object?

In JavaScript, an object is an unordered collection of key-value pairs. Each key (also called a property) has an associated value, which can be any JavaScript data type including other objects, arrays, or functions.

Objects are represented using curly braces `{}`, with properties and their values written as `key: value` pairs separated by commas.

## Creating Objects

### Object Literal Notation

The most common way to create an object is using the object literal notation:

```javascript
const person = {
  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Doe",
  age: 30,
  isEmployed: true
};

console.log(person);
```

Output:
```
{firstName: "John", lastName: "Doe", age: 30, isEmployed: true}
```

### Using the Object Constructor

You can also create objects using the `Object()` constructor:

```javascript
const car = new Object();
car.make = "Toyota";
car.model = "Corolla";
car.year = 2022;

console.log(car);
```

Output:
```
{make: "Toyota", model: "Corolla", year: 2022}
```

## Accessing Object Properties

There are two main ways to access object properties:

### Dot Notation

```javascript
const person = {
  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Doe"
};

console.log(person.firstName); // Output: John
console.log(person.lastName);  // Output: Doe
```

### Bracket Notation

```javascript
const person = {
  firstName: "John", 
  lastName: "Doe"
};

console.log(person["firstName"]); // Output: John
console.log(person["lastName"]);  // Output: Doe
```

Bracket notation is particularly useful when:
- The property name contains spaces or special characters
- The property name is stored in a variable
- You need to access properties dynamically

```javascript
const person = {
  "first name": "John",
  "last name": "Doe"
};

console.log(person["first name"]); // Output: John

const propertyName = "last name";
console.log(person[propertyName]);  // Output: Doe
```

## Modifying Object Properties

Objects are mutable, meaning you can change their properties after creation:

```javascript
const person = {
  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Doe",
  age: 30
};

// Modifying existing properties
person.age = 31;
person["lastName"] = "Smith";

// Adding new properties
person.email = "john.smith@example.com";
person["phone"] = "555-123-4567";

console.log(person);
```

Output:
```
{
  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Smith",
  age: 31,
  email: "john.smith@example.com",
  phone: "555-123-4567"
}
```

## Deleting Properties

You can remove properties using the `delete` operator:

```javascript
const person = {
  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Doe",
  age: 30,
  email: "john.doe@example.com"
};

delete person.email;
console.log(person); // {firstName: "John", lastName: "Doe", age: 30}

// Check if a property exists
console.log("email" in person); // Output: false
console.log("firstName" in person); // Output: true
```

## Objects with Methods

Objects can also contain functions as properties, which are called methods:

```javascript
const calculator = {
  num1: 0,
  num2: 0,
  sum: function() {
    return this.num1 + this.num2;
  },
  multiply: function() {
    return this.num1 * this.num2;
  }
};

calculator.num1 = 5;
calculator.num2 = 3;

console.log(calculator.sum());      // Output: 8
console.log(calculator.multiply()); // Output: 15
```

A more concise way to define methods in object literals (ES6 syntax):

```javascript
const calculator = {
  num1: 0,
  num2: 0,
  sum() {
    return this.num1 + this.num2;
  },
  multiply() {
    return this.num1 * this.num2;
  }
};
```

## Nested Objects

Objects can contain other objects as properties:

```javascript
const person = {
  name: {
    first: "John",
    last: "Doe"
  },
  address: {
    street: "123 Main St",
    city: "Anytown",
    state: "CA",
    zip: "12345"
  }
};

// Accessing nested properties
console.log(person.name.first); // Output: John
console.log(person.address.city); // Output: Anytown
```

## Object Methods and Properties

JavaScript provides several built-in methods and properties to work with objects:

### Object.keys()

Returns an array of a given object's own property names:

```javascript
const person = {
  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Doe",
  age: 30
};

const keys = Object.keys(person);
console.log(keys); // Output: ["firstName", "lastName", "age"]
```

### Object.values()

Returns an array of a given object's own property values:

```javascript
const person = {
  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Doe",
  age: 30
};

const values = Object.values(person);
console.log(values); // Output: ["John", "Doe", 30]
```

### Object.entries()

Returns an array of a given object's own [key, value] pairs:

```javascript
const person = {
  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Doe",
  age: 30
};

const entries = Object.entries(person);
console.log(entries);
// Output: [["firstName", "John"], ["lastName", "Doe"], ["age", 30]]
```

## Real-World Example: User Profile

Let's create a more complex object representing a user profile for a social media application:

```javascript
const userProfile = {
  userId: "user123",
  personalInfo: {
    firstName: "Jane",
    lastName: "Smith",
    dateOfBirth: "1992-04-15",
    email: "jane.smith@example.com",
    phone: "555-987-6543"
  },
  address: {
    street: "456 Oak Avenue",
    city: "San Francisco",
    state: "CA",
    zip: "94107",
    country: "USA"
  },
  preferences: {
    theme: "dark",
    notifications: true,
    privacy: "friends-only"
  },
  friends: ["user456", "user789", "user101"],
  posts: [
    {
      id: "post1",
      content: "Hello world!",
      timestamp: "2023-06-15T14:30:00Z",
      likes: 15
    },
    {
      id: "post2",
      content: "Learning JavaScript objects!",
      timestamp: "2023-06-16T10:15:00Z",
      likes: 42
    }
  ],
  isActive: true,
  lastLogin: "2023-06-17T08:45:00Z",
  
  // Methods
  fullName() {
    return `${this.personalInfo.firstName} ${this.personalInfo.lastName}`;
  },
  
  addFriend(friendId) {
    this.friends.push(friendId);
    return this.friends.length;
  },
  
  createPost(content) {
    const newPost = {
      id: `post${this.posts.length + 1}`,
      content: content,
      timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
      likes: 0
    };
    this.posts.push(newPost);
    return newPost;
  }
};

// Using the user profile object
console.log(userProfile.fullName()); // Output: Jane Smith

userProfile.addFriend("user202");
console.log(userProfile.friends); // Output: ["user456", "user789", "user101", "user202"]

const newPost = userProfile.createPost("Objects are awesome!");
console.log(newPost); // Output: A new post object with 0 likes
```

This example demonstrates how objects can model complex real-world entities with both data and behavior.

## Summary

In this tutorial, you've learned the basics of JavaScript objects:

- Objects are collections of key-value pairs
- Creating objects using literal notation and constructors
- Accessing, modifying, and deleting object properties
- Working with methods inside objects
- Handling nested objects
- Using built-in object methods like `Object.keys()`, `Object.values()`, and `Object.entries()`

JavaScript objects are fundamental to the language and form the basis of more advanced concepts like prototypes, classes, and object-oriented programming in JavaScript.

## Exercises

1. Create an object to represent a book with properties for title, author, publication year, and genre.
2. Add a method to the book object that returns a string describing the book.
3. Create a nested object representing a shopping cart with items, quantities, and prices.
4. Write a function that takes an object and returns the number of properties it has.
5. Create an address book object that can add, remove, and look up contacts.
