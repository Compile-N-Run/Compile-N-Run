# JavaScript Object Methods

## Introduction

In JavaScript, objects are one of the most fundamental data structures. They allow you to store related data and functionality together. While object properties hold data, **object methods** are functions that belong to the object and represent actions that the object can perform.

Object methods are essential for creating interactive and functional JavaScript applications. They enable objects to behave in specific ways and perform operations on their data.

## What Are Object Methods?

An object method is simply a property of an object that happens to be a function. Methods add behavior to objects, allowing them to perform actions or calculations based on their properties.

Let's see the basic syntax for creating object methods:

```javascript
const person = {
  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Doe",
  // This is a method
  fullName: function() {
    return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
  }
};
```

In this example, `fullName` is a method of the `person` object that returns the concatenated first and last names when called.

## Creating Object Methods

There are several ways to create object methods in JavaScript:

### Method 1: Method Definition within Object Literal

```javascript
const calculator = {
  num1: 0,
  num2: 0,
  add: function() {
    return this.num1 + this.num2;
  },
  subtract: function() {
    return this.num1 - this.num2;
  }
};

// Set values
calculator.num1 = 10;
calculator.num2 = 5;

// Call methods
console.log(calculator.add());      // Output: 15
console.log(calculator.subtract()); // Output: 5
```

### Method 2: ES6 Shorthand Method Syntax

ES6 introduced a shorter syntax for defining methods within object literals:

```javascript
const calculator = {
  num1: 0,
  num2: 0,
  // Shorthand method syntax (no "function" keyword needed)
  add() {
    return this.num1 + this.num2;
  },
  subtract() {
    return this.num1 - this.num2;
  }
};

calculator.num1 = 10;
calculator.num2 = 5;
console.log(calculator.add());      // Output: 15
console.log(calculator.subtract()); // Output: 5
```

### Method 3: Adding Methods to Existing Objects

You can add methods to an object after it has been created:

```javascript
const car = {
  brand: "Toyota",
  year: 2020
};

// Adding a method to the existing object
car.getInfo = function() {
  return `${this.brand} model from ${this.year}`;
};

console.log(car.getInfo()); // Output: Toyota model from 2020
```

## The `this` Keyword in Object Methods

Inside an object method, the `this` keyword refers to the object that the method belongs to. It allows methods to access and manipulate the object's properties.

```javascript
const person = {
  name: "Alice",
  age: 30,
  introduce() {
    return `Hi, I'm ${this.name} and I'm ${this.age} years old.`;
  }
};

console.log(person.introduce()); // Output: Hi, I'm Alice and I'm 30 years old.
```

It's important to note that the value of `this` depends on how the method is called, not where it is defined. This can sometimes lead to unexpected behavior, especially when working with callbacks or event handlers.

## Method Chaining

Method chaining is a programming pattern that allows you to call multiple methods on the same object in a single statement. To enable method chaining, each method must return the object itself (`this`):

```javascript
const counter = {
  value: 0,
  increment() {
    this.value += 1;
    return this; // Return the object to enable chaining
  },
  decrement() {
    this.value -= 1;
    return this;
  },
  reset() {
    this.value = 0;
    return this;
  },
  getValue() {
    return this.value;
  }
};

// Chain method calls
const result = counter.increment().increment().decrement().getValue();
console.log(result); // Output: 1
```

## Built-in Object Methods

JavaScript objects come with several built-in methods. Here are some of the most commonly used ones:

### Object.keys()

Returns an array of a given object's property names:

```javascript
const student = {
  name: "John",
  age: 20,
  major: "Computer Science"
};

const properties = Object.keys(student);
console.log(properties); // Output: ["name", "age", "major"]
```

### Object.values()

Returns an array of a given object's property values:

```javascript
const student = {
  name: "John",
  age: 20,
  major: "Computer Science"
};

const values = Object.values(student);
console.log(values); // Output: ["John", 20, "Computer Science"]
```

### Object.entries()

Returns an array of a given object's own enumerable key-value pairs:

```javascript
const student = {
  name: "John",
  age: 20
};

const entries = Object.entries(student);
console.log(entries);
// Output: [["name", "John"], ["age", 20]]

// This is useful for looping through object properties
for (const [key, value] of Object.entries(student)) {
  console.log(`${key}: ${value}`);
}
// Output:
// name: John
// age: 20
```

## Practical Example: A Shopping Cart Object

Let's build a simple shopping cart to demonstrate object methods in action:

```javascript
const shoppingCart = {
  items: [],
  
  // Add item to cart
  addItem(name, price, quantity = 1) {
    this.items.push({
      name,
      price,
      quantity
    });
    return this;
  },
  
  // Remove item from cart
  removeItem(name) {
    this.items = this.items.filter(item => item.name !== name);
    return this;
  },
  
  // Update quantity of an item
  updateQuantity(name, quantity) {
    const item = this.items.find(item => item.name === name);
    if (item) {
      item.quantity = quantity;
    }
    return this;
  },
  
  // Calculate total price
  calculateTotal() {
    return this.items.reduce((total, item) => {
      return total + (item.price * item.quantity);
    }, 0);
  },
  
  // Print cart contents
  printCart() {
    console.log("Shopping Cart Contents:");
    this.items.forEach(item => {
      console.log(`${item.name} - $${item.price} x ${item.quantity}`);
    });
    console.log(`Total: $${this.calculateTotal()}`);
  }
};

// Use the shopping cart
shoppingCart
  .addItem("Laptop", 999, 1)
  .addItem("Headphones", 79.99, 2)
  .addItem("Mouse", 24.99, 1);

shoppingCart.printCart();
// Output:
// Shopping Cart Contents:
// Laptop - $999 x 1
// Headphones - $79.99 x 2
// Mouse - $24.99 x 1
// Total: $1183.97

// Update and remove items
shoppingCart
  .updateQuantity("Laptop", 2)
  .removeItem("Mouse")
  .printCart();
// Output:
// Shopping Cart Contents:
// Laptop - $999 x 2
// Headphones - $79.99 x 2
// Total: $2157.98
```

This example demonstrates how object methods can be used to create a functional shopping cart with various operations.

## Common Pitfalls and Best Practices

### Avoiding `this` Binding Issues

Arrow functions don't have their own `this` binding, so they are not suitable for object methods when you need to access the object's properties:

```javascript
// BAD - Arrow function as method
const person = {
  name: "John",
  greet: () => {
    console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}`); // 'this' refers to the outer scope
  }
};

person.greet(); // Output: Hello, my name is undefined

// GOOD - Regular function as method
const person2 = {
  name: "John",
  greet: function() {
    console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}`); // 'this' refers to person2
  }
};

person2.greet(); // Output: Hello, my name is John
```

### Keeping Methods Simple

Each method should ideally do one thing and do it well. This makes your code more maintainable and easier to test.

### Documenting Methods

For larger applications, it's a good practice to document what each method does, its parameters, and return values.

## Summary

Object methods are functions that are associated with objects and allow objects to perform actions. They can:

- Access and modify the object's properties using the `this` keyword
- Be defined in object literals or added to objects later
- Return values or even the object itself for method chaining
- Use ES6 shorthand syntax for cleaner code

Understanding object methods is crucial for JavaScript programming as they are used extensively in object-oriented programming patterns, DOM manipulation, and many JavaScript libraries and frameworks.

## Exercises

To practice working with object methods, try these exercises:

1. Create a `bankAccount` object with methods for `deposit()`, `withdraw()`, and `getBalance()`.
2. Create a `todoList` object with methods to `addTask()`, `removeTask()`, `markComplete()`, and `listTasks()`.
3. Extend the shopping cart example by adding methods to `applyDiscount()` and `saveToLocalStorage()`.
