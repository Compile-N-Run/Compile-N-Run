# JavaScript Function Expressions

## Introduction

In JavaScript, functions are incredibly versatile and can be defined in multiple ways. One of the most common approaches is using **function expressions**. While you may already be familiar with function declarations, function expressions offer additional flexibility and are a fundamental concept in JavaScript programming.

Function expressions treat functions as values that can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments, returned from other functions, and more. This approach aligns with JavaScript's nature as a language that treats functions as first-class citizens.

## Function Expression Basics

A function expression is created when a function is assigned to a variable or constant. Unlike function declarations, function expressions are not hoisted entirely, which affects when they can be used in your code.

### Syntax

```javascript
const functionName = function(parameters) {
  // code to execute
  return value; // optional
};
```

Let's compare function declarations and expressions:

```javascript
// Function declaration
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

// Function expression
const greetExpression = function(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
};

// Both are called the same way
console.log(greet("Alice"));          // Output: Hello, Alice!
console.log(greetExpression("Bob"));  // Output: Hello, Bob!
```

## Anonymous Function Expressions

Function expressions are often used without a name, creating what we call **anonymous functions**:

```javascript
const add = function(a, b) {
  return a + b;
};

console.log(add(5, 3));  // Output: 8
```

In this example, the function itself doesn't have a name. It's anonymous, but the variable `add` references it.

## Named Function Expressions

You can also give the function itself a name in a function expression:

```javascript
const factorial = function calculateFactorial(n) {
  if (n <= 1) return 1;
  return n * calculateFactorial(n - 1);
};

console.log(factorial(5));  // Output: 120
```

This has a few advantages:
- The internal name (`calculateFactorial`) is useful for recursion
- It helps with debugging, as the function name appears in stack traces
- It provides self-documentation about what the function does

Note that the internal name (`calculateFactorial`) is only available inside the function itself, not in the outer scope.

## Hoisting Differences

Function declarations and expressions behave differently with regards to hoisting:

```javascript
// This works fine
console.log(declarationExample("JavaScript"));  // Output: Hello, JavaScript!

function declarationExample(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

// This throws an error
console.log(expressionExample("JavaScript"));  // Error: expressionExample is not a function

const expressionExample = function(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
};
```

Function declarations are completely hoisted, so you can call them before they're defined in your code. Function expressions, however, follow variable hoisting rulesâ€”the variable is hoisted but not initialized until the code reaches the expression.

## Immediately Invoked Function Expressions (IIFE)

A common pattern with function expressions is to create and execute them at the same time, known as an IIFE (pronounced "iffy"):

```javascript
(function() {
  const message = "I'm executed immediately!";
  console.log(message);
})();  // Output: I'm executed immediately!

// With parameters
(function(name) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
})("JavaScript");  // Output: Hello, JavaScript!
```

IIFEs are useful for creating a private scope for variables and avoiding global namespace pollution.

## Arrow Function Expressions

ES6 introduced a shorter syntax for function expressions called arrow functions:

```javascript
// Traditional function expression
const square = function(x) {
  return x * x;
};

// Arrow function expression
const squareArrow = (x) => {
  return x * x;
};

// Simplified arrow function with implicit return
const squareSimple = x => x * x;

console.log(square(4));        // Output: 16
console.log(squareArrow(4));   // Output: 16
console.log(squareSimple(4));  // Output: 16
```

Arrow functions have some key differences compared to traditional functions:
- They don't have their own `this` binding
- They don't have `arguments` object
- They can't be used as constructors (with `new`)
- They have a more concise syntax, especially for simple functions

## Functions as Arguments

One powerful use of function expressions is passing them as arguments to other functions:

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

// Using a function expression as an argument
const doubled = numbers.map(function(number) {
  return number * 2;
});

console.log(doubled);  // Output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]

// Using an arrow function makes it even more concise
const tripled = numbers.map(number => number * 3);

console.log(tripled);  // Output: [3, 6, 9, 12, 15]
```

## Real-World Examples

### Event Handling

Function expressions are commonly used for event handlers in web development:

```javascript
document.getElementById("myButton").addEventListener("click", function(event) {
  console.log("Button was clicked!");
  console.log("Event details:", event);
});
```

### Higher-Order Functions

Many JavaScript array methods use function expressions as callbacks:

```javascript
// Filter even numbers
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];
const evenNumbers = numbers.filter(function(number) {
  return number % 2 === 0;
});
console.log(evenNumbers);  // Output: [2, 4, 6]

// Sort array of objects
const products = [
  { name: "Laptop", price: 1000 },
  { name: "Phone", price: 500 },
  { name: "Tablet", price: 300 }
];

products.sort(function(a, b) {
  return a.price - b.price;
});

console.log(products);
// Output: [{name: "Tablet", price: 300}, {name: "Phone", price: 500}, {name: "Laptop", price: 1000}]
```

### Factory Functions

Function expressions can return other functions, enabling powerful patterns like factories:

```javascript
function createGreeter(greeting) {
  return function(name) {
    return `${greeting}, ${name}!`;
  };
}

const sayHello = createGreeter("Hello");
const sayHowdy = createGreeter("Howdy");

console.log(sayHello("Alice"));  // Output: Hello, Alice!
console.log(sayHowdy("Bob"));    // Output: Howdy, Bob!
```

## When to Use Function Expressions

Function expressions are particularly useful when you:

1. Need to pass a function as an argument
2. Want to create a function conditionally
3. Need a closure to preserve variables
4. Want to use an IIFE to create a private scope
5. Need more concise syntax using arrow functions
6. Are working with methods that expect function callbacks

## Summary

Function expressions are a fundamental part of JavaScript that treat functions as values. They offer flexibility not found in function declarations, enabling powerful patterns like callbacks, closures, and higher-order functions.

Key points to remember:
- Function expressions assign functions to variables
- They aren't hoisted like function declarations
- They can be anonymous or named
- Arrow functions provide a concise syntax
- They enable functional programming patterns
- They're commonly used for callbacks and event handlers

Function expressions are essential to writing modern JavaScript code and mastering them will significantly improve your programming capabilities.

## Practice Exercises

1. Create a function expression that calculates the average of an array of numbers
2. Write an IIFE that outputs your name to the console
3. Create a higher-order function that takes a function and a number, then applies the function that many times
4. Refactor regular function expressions to arrow functions where appropriate
5. Implement a simple event handling system using function expressions as callbacks
