# JavaScript Conditional Statements

In programming, we often need to make decisions based on certain conditions. JavaScript provides several ways to implement decision-making in your code, known as conditional statements. These statements allow your program to perform different actions depending on whether a specific condition evaluates to true or false.

## Introduction to Conditional Statements

Conditional statements are essential building blocks in programming that enable your code to make decisions and execute different actions based on different inputs. They allow your programs to be flexible, responsive, and capable of handling various scenarios.

In JavaScript, there are three main types of conditional statements:

1. `if` statements
2. `if...else` statements 
3. `switch` statements

Let's explore each of these in detail.

## The `if` Statement

The `if` statement is the simplest form of conditional statement. It executes a block of code only when the specified condition is true.

### Basic Syntax

```javascript
if (condition) {
  // code to be executed if the condition is true
}
```

### How It Works

1. First, the condition inside the parentheses is evaluated
2. If the condition is true, the code block inside the curly braces `{}` is executed
3. If the condition is false, the code block is skipped entirely

### Example

```javascript
const temperature = 28;

if (temperature > 25) {
  console.log("It's a hot day!");
}

// Output: It's a hot day!
```

In this example, since the temperature (28) is greater than 25, the condition is true, and the message is printed to the console.

## The `if...else` Statement

The `if...else` statement extends the basic `if` statement by providing an alternative code block to execute when the condition is false.

### Basic Syntax

```javascript
if (condition) {
  // code to be executed if the condition is true
} else {
  // code to be executed if the condition is false
}
```

### Example

```javascript
const hour = 20;

if (hour < 18) {
  console.log("Good day!");
} else {
  console.log("Good evening!");
}

// Output: Good evening!
```

In this example, since the hour (20) is not less than 18, the condition is false, so the code in the `else` block is executed.

## The `if...else if...else` Statement

When you need to check multiple conditions, you can chain several `if...else` statements together using `else if`.

### Basic Syntax

```javascript
if (condition1) {
  // code to be executed if condition1 is true
} else if (condition2) {
  // code to be executed if condition1 is false and condition2 is true
} else {
  // code to be executed if both condition1 and condition2 are false
}
```

### Example

```javascript
const score = 75;

if (score >= 90) {
  console.log("Grade: A");
} else if (score >= 80) {
  console.log("Grade: B");
} else if (score >= 70) {
  console.log("Grade: C");
} else if (score >= 60) {
  console.log("Grade: D");
} else {
  console.log("Grade: F");
}

// Output: Grade: C
```

In this example, the program checks multiple score ranges and assigns a grade accordingly. Since the score is 75, it falls into the "Grade: C" condition.

## Ternary Operator

The ternary operator provides a concise way to write simple conditional statements. It's often used for assigning values based on a condition.

### Basic Syntax

```javascript
condition ? expressionIfTrue : expressionIfFalse
```

### Example

```javascript
const age = 20;
const canVote = age >= 18 ? "Yes" : "No";

console.log(`Can the person vote? ${canVote}`);
// Output: Can the person vote? Yes
```

In this example, since age (20) is greater than or equal to 18, the ternary operator evaluates to "Yes".

## The `switch` Statement

The `switch` statement provides a way to handle multiple possible conditions for a single variable. It can be more readable than multiple `if...else` statements when checking the same variable against different values.

### Basic Syntax

```javascript
switch (expression) {
  case value1:
    // code to execute if expression === value1
    break;
  case value2:
    // code to execute if expression === value2
    break;
  // more cases as needed
  default:
    // code to execute if none of the cases match
}
```

### How It Works

1. The `switch` expression is evaluated once
2. The value of the expression is compared with the values of each `case`
3. If there's a match, the associated block of code is executed
4. The `break` statement exits the switch block
5. The `default` statement is optional and executes if no case match is found

### Example

```javascript
const day = new Date().getDay();
let dayName;

switch (day) {
  case 0:
    dayName = "Sunday";
    break;
  case 1:
    dayName = "Monday";
    break;
  case 2:
    dayName = "Tuesday";
    break;
  case 3:
    dayName = "Wednesday";
    break;
  case 4:
    dayName = "Thursday";
    break;
  case 5:
    dayName = "Friday";
    break;
  case 6:
    dayName = "Saturday";
    break;
  default:
    dayName = "Unknown Day";
}

console.log(`Today is ${dayName}`);
// Output depends on the current day
```

### Multiple Cases with Same Action

You can group cases when you want the same action for multiple values:

```javascript
const fruit = "Apple";
let category;

switch (fruit) {
  case "Apple":
  case "Orange":
  case "Banana":
    category = "Regular fruit";
    break;
  case "Mango":
  case "Pineapple":
    category = "Tropical fruit";
    break;
  default:
    category = "Unknown fruit";
}

console.log(`${fruit} is a ${category}`);
// Output: Apple is a Regular fruit
```

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: Simple Authentication

```javascript
function login(username, password) {
  const correctUsername = "user123";
  const correctPassword = "pass456";
  
  if (username === correctUsername && password === correctPassword) {
    return "Login successful!";
  } else if (username !== correctUsername) {
    return "Username incorrect!";
  } else {
    return "Password incorrect!";
  }
}

console.log(login("user123", "pass456")); // Output: Login successful!
console.log(login("user999", "pass456")); // Output: Username incorrect!
console.log(login("user123", "wrongpass")); // Output: Password incorrect!
```

### Example 2: Discount Calculator

```javascript
function calculateDiscount(purchaseAmount, membershipLevel) {
  let discount = 0;
  
  switch (membershipLevel.toLowerCase()) {
    case "platinum":
      discount = 0.15;
      break;
    case "gold":
      discount = 0.10;
      break;
    case "silver":
      discount = 0.05;
      break;
    default:
      discount = 0;
  }
  
  // Additional discount for large purchases
  if (purchaseAmount >= 500) {
    discount += 0.05;
  } else if (purchaseAmount >= 200) {
    discount += 0.02;
  }
  
  const discountAmount = purchaseAmount * discount;
  const finalPrice = purchaseAmount - discountAmount;
  
  return {
    originalPrice: purchaseAmount,
    discountPercentage: discount * 100,
    discountAmount: discountAmount,
    finalPrice: finalPrice
  };
}

const purchase = calculateDiscount(300, "Gold");
console.log(`Original price: $${purchase.originalPrice}`);
console.log(`Discount: ${purchase.discountPercentage}%`);
console.log(`You saved: $${purchase.discountAmount.toFixed(2)}`);
console.log(`Final price: $${purchase.finalPrice.toFixed(2)}`);

/* Output:
Original price: $300
Discount: 12%
You saved: $36.00
Final price: $264.00
*/
```

### Example 3: Weather App Recommendation

```javascript
function getWeatherAdvice(temperature, isRaining) {
  let advice = "";
  
  if (isRaining) {
    advice = "Remember to take an umbrella! ";
  }
  
  if (temperature < 0) {
    advice += "It's freezing! Wear a heavy coat, gloves, and a hat.";
  } else if (temperature < 10) {
    advice += "It's cold. Wear a warm coat.";
  } else if (temperature < 20) {
    advice += "It's cool. A light jacket would be good.";
  } else if (temperature < 30) {
    advice += "It's warm. A t-shirt should be fine.";
  } else {
    advice += "It's hot! Stay hydrated and wear sunscreen.";
  }
  
  return advice;
}

console.log(getWeatherAdvice(25, false));
// Output: It's warm. A t-shirt should be fine.

console.log(getWeatherAdvice(5, true));
// Output: Remember to take an umbrella! It's cold. Wear a warm coat.
```

## Best Practices for Conditional Statements

1. **Keep conditionals simple**: Complex conditions can be hard to read and debug. Consider breaking them into smaller, more manageable pieces.

2. **Use meaningful variable names**: This helps make your conditions more readable.

3. **Avoid deeply nested conditionals**: Too many nested `if` statements can make code hard to follow. Consider restructuring or using switch statements where appropriate.

4. **Be careful with equality operators**: Use strict equality (`===`) instead of loose equality (`==`) to avoid unexpected type conversions.

5. **Don't forget `break` in switch statements**: Forgetting the `break` statement will cause execution to "fall through" to the next case.

6. **Consider ternary operators for simple cases**: They can make your code more concise, but don't overuse them as they can reduce readability.

## Summary

Conditional statements are fundamental building blocks in JavaScript that allow your code to make decisions based on specific conditions:

- **`if` statements** execute code when a condition is true
- **`if...else` statements** provide an alternative when the condition is false
- **`if...else if...else` chains** handle multiple conditions
- **Ternary operators** provide a concise way for simple conditional expressions
- **`switch` statements** are ideal for comparing a single value against multiple possible cases

By mastering conditional statements, you've taken a significant step toward writing dynamic and responsive JavaScript programs that can handle various scenarios based on inputs and conditions.

## Exercises

1. Write a function that takes a number as input and returns "Positive", "Negative", or "Zero" based on the input value.

2. Create a function that determines whether a year is a leap year. (Hint: a year is a leap year if it's divisible by 4, but not divisible by 100 unless it's also divisible by 400).

3. Write a "rock, paper, scissors" game that takes two player choices and determines the winner using conditional statements.

4. Create a function that converts numerical grades (0-100) to letter grades (A, B, C, D, F) using both if-else chains and switch statements. Compare the two approaches.
