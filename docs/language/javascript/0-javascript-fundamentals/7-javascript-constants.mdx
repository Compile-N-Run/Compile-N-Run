# JavaScript Constants

Constants are a fundamental concept in JavaScript that allows you to store values that cannot be changed once they've been defined. They were introduced in ECMAScript 6 (ES6) and provide a way to declare immutable variables, which helps prevent accidental reassignment and makes your code more predictable.

## Introduction to Constants

In JavaScript, constants are declared using the `const` keyword. Unlike variables declared with `var` or `let`, constants cannot be reassigned a new value after their initial assignment.

Let's start with a simple example:

```javascript
const PI = 3.14159;
console.log(PI); // Output: 3.14159

// Trying to reassign will cause an error
// PI = 3.14; // TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.
```

## Why Use Constants?

Constants offer several benefits in your JavaScript code:

1. **Code clarity**: They signal to other developers that this value should not change
2. **Prevention of errors**: They protect against accidental reassignment
3. **Performance optimizations**: In some cases, JavaScript engines can optimize code with constants

## Declaring Constants

### Basic Syntax

The syntax for declaring a constant is straightforward:

```javascript
const CONSTANT_NAME = value;
```

By convention, constants that represent fixed values are often written in UPPERCASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES, though this is a style preference, not a language requirement.

### Declaration Rules

When working with constants, keep these rules in mind:

1. Constants must be initialized at the time of declaration
2. You cannot declare a constant without assigning a value
3. Constants have block scope (similar to `let`)

Example of these rules:

```javascript
// Must initialize at declaration time
const API_KEY = "abc123"; // Correct

// Cannot declare without a value
// const DATABASE_URL; // SyntaxError: Missing initializer in const declaration

// Block scope example
{
  const BLOCK_CONSTANT = "I'm local to this block";
  console.log(BLOCK_CONSTANT); // Output: I'm local to this block
}
// console.log(BLOCK_CONSTANT); // ReferenceError: BLOCK_CONSTANT is not defined
```

## Constants vs Variables

Here's a quick comparison between constants and variables:

```javascript
// Variable (can be reassigned)
let count = 1;
count = 2; // This works fine

// Constant (cannot be reassigned)
const MAX_USERS = 100;
// MAX_USERS = 200; // TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.

// But variables created with var don't have block scope
{
  var x = 10;
  const y = 20;
}
console.log(x); // Output: 10
// console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is not defined
```

## Constants and Objects

An important distinction to understand is that while a constant cannot be reassigned, the content of objects or arrays declared as constants **can** be modified.

### Objects with const

```javascript
const user = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30
};

// You can modify properties
user.age = 31;
console.log(user); // Output: { name: "John", age: 31 }

// But you cannot reassign the entire object
// user = { name: "Jane", age: 25 }; // TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.
```

### Arrays with const

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];

// You can modify elements
numbers.push(5);
console.log(numbers); // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

// But you cannot reassign the entire array
// numbers = [5, 6, 7]; // TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.
```

## Preventing Object Mutations

If you want to make an object truly immutable, you can use `Object.freeze()`:

```javascript
const settings = Object.freeze({
  theme: "dark",
  notifications: true,
  fontSize: 16
});

// Modification attempts are silently ignored in non-strict mode
settings.theme = "light";
console.log(settings.theme); // Output: "dark" (unchanged)

// In strict mode, it throws an error
// "use strict";
// settings.theme = "light"; // TypeError: Cannot assign to read only property 'theme' of object
```

## Real-World Applications

Let's look at some practical examples of using constants:

### Configuration Settings

```javascript
const CONFIG = {
  API_URL: "https://api.example.com/v1",
  MAX_RETRIES: 3,
  TIMEOUT_MS: 5000,
  DEBUG_MODE: false
};

function fetchData(endpoint) {
  console.log(`Fetching from ${CONFIG.API_URL}/${endpoint}...`);
  // Actual fetch logic would go here
}

fetchData("users"); // Output: Fetching from https://api.example.com/v1/users...
```

### Application Constants

```javascript
const DAYS_IN_WEEK = 7;
const HOURS_IN_DAY = 24;
const SECONDS_IN_MINUTE = 60;

function calculateTotalSeconds(days, hours, minutes) {
  return days * DAYS_IN_WEEK * HOURS_IN_DAY * SECONDS_IN_MINUTE * SECONDS_IN_MINUTE + 
         hours * SECONDS_IN_MINUTE * SECONDS_IN_MINUTE + 
         minutes * SECONDS_IN_MINUTE;
}

const totalSeconds = calculateTotalSeconds(1, 2, 30);
console.log(`Total seconds: ${totalSeconds}`); // Output: Total seconds: 95400
```

### Event Types

```javascript
const EVENTS = {
  CLICK: 'click',
  HOVER: 'mouseover',
  SUBMIT: 'submit',
  LOAD: 'load'
};

function addEventHandler(element, eventType, handler) {
  if (Object.values(EVENTS).includes(eventType)) {
    element.addEventListener(eventType, handler);
    console.log(`Event handler for ${eventType} added.`);
  } else {
    console.error(`Unsupported event type: ${eventType}`);
  }
}

// Usage (in a browser environment)
// addEventHandler(document.getElementById('submit-button'), EVENTS.CLICK, () => {
//   console.log('Button clicked!');
// });
```

## Best Practices for Using Constants

1. **Use constants for values that should not change** - Mathematical constants, configuration values, etc.

2. **Follow naming conventions** - Use uppercase names with underscores for true constants (`MAX_SIZE`), and regular camelCase for constant objects or arrays that might have internal changes (`userConfig`).

3. **Declare at the appropriate scope** - Place constants at the narrowest possible scope where they're needed.

4. **Group related constants** - Consider organizing related constants together in objects.

5. **Use `Object.freeze()` for immutable objects** - When you need to ensure that even the properties of an object constant cannot be changed.

## Summary

Constants are a powerful feature in JavaScript that help make your code more predictable and safe. Remember these key points:

- Constants are declared using the `const` keyword and cannot be reassigned
- Constants must be initialized when declared
- They have block scope, like variables declared with `let`
- For object and array constants, the contents can still be modified
- Use `Object.freeze()` to create truly immutable objects

By properly using constants, you can write more robust code that clearly communicates your intentions to other developers and prevents a whole class of potential bugs.

## Exercises

1. Create a calculator that uses constants for mathematical operations like PI, E, etc.
2. Create a configuration object with constants for a web application (theme colors, API endpoints, etc.).
3. Try to implement a "true" constant by combining `const` with `Object.freeze()` and test its behavior.
4. Convert a program that uses regular variables to use constants where appropriate.
