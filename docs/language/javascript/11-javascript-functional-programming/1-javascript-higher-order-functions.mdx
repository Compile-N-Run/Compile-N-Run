# JavaScript Higher Order Functions

## Introduction

Higher Order Functions (HOFs) are a fundamental concept in functional programming that significantly enhances JavaScript's flexibility and expressiveness. A higher order function is simply a function that either:

1. Takes one or more functions as arguments, or
2. Returns a function as its result

Higher order functions allow you to abstract over actions, not just values. They enable you to create more modular, reusable, and cleaner code by separating concerns and reducing repetition.

## Why Higher Order Functions Matter

In traditional imperative programming, we often use loops and conditional statements to process data. While this approach works, it often leads to verbose code that mixes "what to do" with "how to do it." Higher order functions help separate these concerns:

- They make code more **declarative** (expressing what you want to do) rather than **imperative** (detailing how to do it)
- They allow for better **abstraction** and **composition**
- They result in fewer bugs and more maintainable code

## Common Built-in Higher Order Functions

JavaScript has several built-in higher order functions that you'll use frequently. Let's explore the most important ones:

### 1. Array.prototype.map()

The `map()` method creates a new array by applying a function to each element of the original array.

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

// Using map to double each number
const doubled = numbers.map(num => num * 2);

console.log(doubled); // Output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```

In this example, `map()` takes a function that doubles a number and applies it to each element in the array, returning a new array with the results.

### 2. Array.prototype.filter()

The `filter()` method creates a new array containing only the elements that pass a test specified by a function.

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];

// Using filter to get only even numbers
const evenNumbers = numbers.filter(num => num % 2 === 0);

console.log(evenNumbers); // Output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```

Here, `filter()` uses a function that tests if a number is even, keeping only those elements that pass the test.

### 3. Array.prototype.reduce()

The `reduce()` method executes a reducer function on each element of the array, resulting in a single output value.

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

// Using reduce to sum all numbers
const sum = numbers.reduce((accumulator, currentValue) => accumulator + currentValue, 0);

console.log(sum); // Output: 15
```

In this example, `reduce()` takes a function that adds the current value to an accumulator, starting with an initial value of 0.

### 4. Array.prototype.forEach()

The `forEach()` method executes a provided function once for each array element.

```javascript
const fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry'];

// Using forEach to log each fruit
fruits.forEach(fruit => {
  console.log(`I like ${fruit}s!`);
});

/* Output:
I like apples!
I like bananas!
I like cherrys!
*/
```

Unlike `map()`, `forEach()` doesn't return a new array; it's used for its side effects.

### 5. Array.prototype.sort()

The `sort()` method sorts the elements of an array in place and returns the sorted array.

```javascript
const fruits = ['cherry', 'apple', 'banana'];

// Using sort to arrange alphabetically
fruits.sort();
console.log(fruits); // Output: ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']

// Using sort with a custom comparison function
const numbers = [40, 1, 5, 200];
numbers.sort((a, b) => a - b);
console.log(numbers); // Output: [1, 5, 40, 200]
```

## Creating Your Own Higher Order Functions

One of the most powerful aspects of JavaScript is that you can create your own higher order functions. Let's create some examples:

### Function that takes a function as an argument

```javascript
function operateOnArray(arr, operationFn) {
  const result = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    result.push(operationFn(arr[i]));
  }
  return result;
}

const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const squaredNumbers = operateOnArray(numbers, num => num * num);
console.log(squaredNumbers); // Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
```

In this example, we created a higher order function `operateOnArray` that takes an array and a function, then applies that function to each element.

### Function that returns a function

```javascript
function multiplyBy(factor) {
  return function(number) {
    return number * factor;
  };
}

const double = multiplyBy(2);
const triple = multiplyBy(3);

console.log(double(5)); // Output: 10
console.log(triple(5)); // Output: 15
```

Here, `multiplyBy` is a higher order function that returns a specialized function based on the factor provided.

## Real-World Applications

Higher order functions aren't just theoretical concepts; they're incredibly useful in real-world applications:

### 1. Data Transformation Pipeline

```javascript
// Processing user data
const users = [
  { id: 1, name: 'Alice', age: 25, active: true },
  { id: 2, name: 'Bob', age: 17, active: false },
  { id: 3, name: 'Charlie', age: 32, active: true },
  { id: 4, name: 'Diana', age: 15, active: true }
];

// Get names of active adults
const activeAdultNames = users
  .filter(user => user.active)
  .filter(user => user.age >= 18)
  .map(user => user.name);

console.log(activeAdultNames); // Output: ['Alice', 'Charlie']
```

### 2. Event Handling with Debounce

```javascript
// Debounce function to limit how often a function can be called
function debounce(func, delay) {
  let timeout;
  
  return function(...args) {
    clearTimeout(timeout);
    timeout = setTimeout(() => {
      func.apply(this, args);
    }, delay);
  };
}

// Usage example for search input
const handleSearch = debounce(function(event) {
  console.log('Searching for:', event.target.value);
  // API call or search logic
}, 300);

// In a real application, you'd attach this to an input:
// searchInput.addEventListener('input', handleSearch);
```

In this example, `debounce` is a higher order function that helps improve performance by ensuring a function isn't called too frequently.

### 3. Memoization for Performance Optimization

```javascript
// Memoize function to cache results of expensive operations
function memoize(func) {
  const cache = {};
  
  return function(...args) {
    const key = JSON.stringify(args);
    if (cache[key]) {
      console.log('Retrieved from cache');
      return cache[key];
    }
    
    const result = func.apply(this, args);
    cache[key] = result;
    return result;
  };
}

// Example with a fibonacci function
function fibonacci(n) {
  if (n <= 1) return n;
  return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2);
}

const memoizedFibonacci = memoize(function(n) {
  if (n <= 1) return n;
  return memoizedFibonacci(n - 1) + memoizedFibonacci(n - 2);
});

console.time('Regular');
fibonacci(35);
console.timeEnd('Regular');

console.time('Memoized');
memoizedFibonacci(35);
console.timeEnd('Memoized');
```

This example shows how higher order functions can dramatically improve performance through techniques like memoization.

## Common Patterns with Higher Order Functions

### Function Composition

```javascript
// Simple function composition
const compose = (f, g) => x => f(g(x));

const addOne = x => x + 1;
const double = x => x * 2;

const addOneThenDouble = compose(double, addOne);
const doubleTheAddOne = compose(addOne, double);

console.log(addOneThenDouble(3)); // Output: 8 (double(3+1) = double(4) = 8)
console.log(doubleTheAddOne(3)); // Output: 7 (addOne(3*2) = addOne(6) = 7)
```

### Partial Application

```javascript
function partial(fn, ...args) {
  return function(...moreArgs) {
    return fn(...args, ...moreArgs);
  };
}

function greet(greeting, name) {
  return `${greeting}, ${name}!`;
}

const sayHello = partial(greet, 'Hello');
console.log(sayHello('Alice')); // Output: Hello, Alice!

const sayGoodbye = partial(greet, 'Goodbye');
console.log(sayGoodbye('Bob')); // Output: Goodbye, Bob!
```

## Best Practices

When working with higher order functions:

1. **Keep functions pure** when possible (no side effects)
2. **Use descriptive names** for your functions and callback parameters
3. **Chain functions thoughtfully** - too much chaining can reduce readability
4. **Consider performance** - higher order functions like `map` and `filter` create new arrays, which may impact memory usage for very large datasets
5. **Error handling** - remember to handle potential errors in your callback functions

## Summary

Higher order functions are a powerful tool in JavaScript that allows for more abstract, modular, and concise code. By understanding and utilizing functions like `map`, `filter`, and `reduce`, as well as creating your own higher order functions, you can write code that is both more maintainable and expressive.

The ability to treat functions as first-class citizens—passing them as arguments and returning them from other functions—is what makes JavaScript particularly well-suited for functional programming techniques.

## Exercises

To solidify your understanding of higher order functions, try these exercises:

1. Implement your own version of `map`, `filter`, and `reduce` functions
2. Create a function that takes an array of numbers and returns a new array containing only the prime numbers
3. Write a function that takes an array of functions and returns a new function that applies each of them in sequence
4. Create a "pipe" function that composes multiple functions (similar to the compose example, but applies functions from left to right)
5. Implement a throttle function (similar to debounce, but ensures a function is called at most once in a specified time period)
