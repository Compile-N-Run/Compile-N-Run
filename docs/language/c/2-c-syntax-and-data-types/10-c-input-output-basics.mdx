# C Input Output

Input and output operations are fundamental to any programming language. They allow us to interact with the user and present our program's results. In C, the standard library provides several functions for handling input and output operations through the `stdio.h` header.

## Including the Standard I/O Header

To perform I/O operations in C, you need to include the standard input-output header file:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
```

This header file contains declarations for functions like `printf()`, `scanf()`, `getchar()`, `putchar()`, and many others that we'll explore in this guide.

## Standard Streams in C

C programs have three standard streams predefined when a program starts execution:

1. **stdin (Standard Input)**: Default input source, typically the keyboard
2. **stdout (Standard Output)**: Default output destination, typically the console/screen
3. **stderr (Standard Error)**: Used for error messages, typically displayed on the screen

## Basic Output Functions

### The `printf()` Function

The most commonly used function for output in C is `printf()` (print formatted). It sends formatted output to the standard output (stdout).

Basic syntax:
```c
printf("format_string", argument1, argument2, ...);
```

Example:
```c
printf("Hello, World!\n");
```

The `\n` is a newline character that moves the cursor to the next line after printing.

### The `putchar()` Function

The `putchar()` function outputs a single character to the standard output.

Syntax:
```c
putchar(character);
```

Example:
```c
putchar('A');  // Outputs: A
```

### The `puts()` Function

The `puts()` function outputs a string followed by a newline character to the standard output.

Syntax:
```c
puts(string);
```

Example:
```c
puts("Hello, World!");  // Outputs: Hello, World! (with a newline)
```

## Basic Input Functions

### The `scanf()` Function

The `scanf()` function reads formatted input from the standard input.

Basic syntax:
```c
scanf("format_string", &variable1, &variable2, ...);
```

Example:
```c
int age;
printf("Enter your age: ");
scanf("%d", &age);
printf("You entered: %d\n", age);
```

> **Note**: The `&` operator is used to pass the address (memory location) of the variable where the input will be stored.

### The `getchar()` Function

The `getchar()` function reads a single character from the standard input.

Syntax:
```c
variable = getchar();
```

Example:
```c
char ch;
printf("Enter a character: ");
ch = getchar();
printf("You entered: %c\n", ch);
```

### The `gets()` Function

:::caution
The `gets()` function is considered unsafe and has been removed from the C standard library in newer versions due to potential buffer overflow issues. Use `fgets()` instead.
:::

The `fgets()` function is a safer alternative to `gets()` for reading strings:

```c
char name[50];
printf("Enter your name: ");
fgets(name, 50, stdin);
printf("Hello, %s", name);
```

## A Complete I/O Example

Let's combine what we've learned to create a simple program that interacts with the user:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    char name[50];
    int age;
    
    // Output prompts and receive input
    printf("Enter your name: ");
    fgets(name, 50, stdin);
    
    printf("Enter your age: ");
    scanf("%d", &age);
    
    // Display the information
    printf("\n--- User Information ---\n");
    printf("Name: %s", name);  // No need for \n as fgets preserves the newline
    printf("Age: %d years\n", age);
    
    return 0;
}
```

## Common Issues with I/O Functions

### Input Buffer Issues

When mixing different input functions (like `scanf()` and `fgets()`), you might encounter issues with the input buffer. For example, after using `scanf()` to read a number, the newline character remains in the buffer, which can affect subsequent `fgets()` calls.

To fix this, you can clear the input buffer:

```c
int age;
char name[50];

printf("Enter your age: ");
scanf("%d", &age);

// Clear the input buffer
while (getchar() != '\n');

printf("Enter your name: ");
fgets(name, 50, stdin);
```

### Format Specifiers

Ensure you use the correct format specifiers with `scanf()` and `printf()` to avoid unexpected behavior:

| Format Specifier | Data Type               |
|------------------|-------------------------|
| %d               | Integer                 |
| %f               | Float                   |
| %lf              | Double                  |
| %c               | Character               |
| %s               | String                  |
| %x               | Hexadecimal             |
| %p               | Pointer                 |

## Summary

Basic I/O in C revolves around these key functions:
- Output: `printf()`, `putchar()`, `puts()`
- Input: `scanf()`, `getchar()`, `fgets()`

In the next section, we'll dive deeper into formatted I/O with `printf()` and `scanf()` to handle more complex input and output patterns.
