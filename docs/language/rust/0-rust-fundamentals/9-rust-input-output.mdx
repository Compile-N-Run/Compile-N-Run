# Rust Input Output

## Introduction

Input and output (I/O) operations are essential for any practical program. They allow your application to interact with users, read data from files, and save information for later use. In Rust, I/O operations are handled through a robust and safe system that prevents common bugs while maintaining good performance.

This guide will walk you through the fundamentals of handling input and output in Rust, covering:
- Standard input/output (stdin/stdout)
- Reading user input from the console
- Displaying information to users
- Working with files
- Error handling for I/O operations

Let's dive into how Rust handles these operations!

## Standard Input and Output

### The `std::io` Module

Rust's standard library provides the `std::io` module, which contains the core functionality for input and output operations. To use this module, you'll need to include it at the beginning of your Rust file:

```rust
use std::io;
```

### Reading from Standard Input

One of the most common input operations is reading user input from the command line. Let's start with a simple example:

```rust
use std::io;

fn main() {
    println!("What's your name?");
    
    let mut input = String::new();
    
    io::stdin()
        .read_line(&mut input)
        .expect("Failed to read line");
    
    println!("Hello, {}!", input.trim());
}
```

Let's break down this example:

1. We create a mutable `String` variable called `input` to store the user's input.
2. `io::stdin()` gives us a handle to the standard input stream.
3. The `read_line()` method reads a line of text from stdin and appends it to our string.
4. `read_line()` returns a `Result` type, which we handle with `expect()`. In a real application, you'd want to use proper error handling.
5. We use `trim()` to remove the newline character at the end of the input.

When you run this program, it will:
- Display "What's your name?"
- Wait for the user to type something and press Enter
- Display "Hello, [user input]!"

### Writing to Standard Output

Rust provides several macros for outputting text:

```rust
fn main() {
    // Basic printing
    println!("This is a line of text"); // Adds a newline at the end
    
    // Print without a newline
    print!("This won't end with a newline. ");
    print!("See?
");
    
    // Formatted printing
    let name = "Rustacean";
    let age = 5;
    println!("Hello, my name is {} and I'm {} years old.", name, age);
    
    // Named parameters
    println!("{greeting}, {name}!", greeting = "Hello", name = "World");
    
    // Debugging information
    let point = (3, 4);
    println!("Debug output: {:?}", point);
    println!("Pretty debug output: {:#?}", point);
}
```

The `println!` and `print!` macros are the most common way to display output in Rust.

## Reading Different Types of Input

Often, you'll need to read input as a specific type (like numbers). Rust requires explicit type conversion for this:

```rust
use std::io;

fn main() {
    println!("Enter a number:");
    
    let mut input = String::new();
    
    io::stdin()
        .read_line(&mut input)
        .expect("Failed to read line");
    
    // Convert string to integer
    let number: i32 = match input.trim().parse() {
        Ok(num) => num,
        Err(_) => {
            println!("That's not a valid number");
            return;
        }
    };
    
    println!("You entered: {}", number);
    println!("Double that is: {}", number * 2);
}
```

In this example:
1. We read a line of text as before
2. We use `trim()` to remove whitespace and `parse()` to attempt conversion to an `i32`
3. We handle the Result using pattern matching to deal with possible errors

### Reading Multiple Inputs

Let's see how to read multiple inputs from a user:

```rust
use std::io;

fn main() {
    // Read first number
    println!("Enter the first number:");
    let first_number = read_number();
    
    // Read second number
    println!("Enter the second number:");
    let second_number = read_number();
    
    // Calculate and display the sum
    let sum = first_number + second_number;
    println!("{} + {} = {}", first_number, second_number, sum);
}

fn read_number() -> i32 {
    let mut input = String::new();
    
    io::stdin()
        .read_line(&mut input)
        .expect("Failed to read line");
    
    match input.trim().parse() {
        Ok(num) => num,
        Err(_) => {
            println!("Invalid input! Defaulting to 0.");
            0
        }
    }
}
```

Here we've created a helper function `read_number()` to avoid code duplication.

## Working with Files

File operations are another important aspect of I/O. Let's explore how to read from and write to files in Rust.

### Writing to a File

```rust
use std::fs::File;
use std::io::Write;

fn main() {
    let mut file = File::create("output.txt")
        .expect("Failed to create file");
    
    file.write_all(b"Hello, Rust file I/O!")
        .expect("Failed to write to file");
    
    println!("Successfully wrote to file");
}
```

In this example:
1. We use `File::create()` to create a new file (or overwrite an existing one)
2. `write_all()` writes a byte slice to the file
3. We use `expect()` for simple error handling

### Reading from a File

```rust
use std::fs::File;
use std::io::{self, Read};

fn main() {
    let mut file = File::open("output.txt")
        .expect("Failed to open file");
    
    let mut contents = String::new();
    file.read_to_string(&mut contents)
        .expect("Failed to read file");
    
    println!("File contents: {}", contents);
}
```

This code:
1. Opens an existing file with `File::open()`
2. Creates a String to hold the contents
3. Reads the entire file into the string
4. Prints the contents

### Better Error Handling with `?` Operator

The `?` operator provides a more concise way to handle errors. It automatically propagates errors up the call stack:

```rust
use std::fs::File;
use std::io::{self, Read};

fn read_file_contents(path: &str) -> io::Result<String> {
    let mut file = File::open(path)?;
    let mut contents = String::new();
    file.read_to_string(&mut contents)?;
    Ok(contents)
}

fn main() {
    match read_file_contents("output.txt") {
        Ok(contents) => println!("File contents: {}", contents),
        Err(error) => println!("Error reading file: {}", error),
    }
}
```

This pattern is the preferred way to handle errors in Rust for real applications.

### Reading a File Line by Line

For large files, reading line by line is more efficient:

```rust
use std::fs::File;
use std::io::{self, BufRead, BufReader};

fn main() -> io::Result<()> {
    let file = File::open("output.txt")?;
    let reader = BufReader::new(file);
    
    for (index, line) in reader.lines().enumerate() {
        let line = line?;
        println!("Line {}: {}", index + 1, line);
    }
    
    Ok(())
}
```

The `BufReader` provides buffered reading capabilities, making line-by-line processing more efficient.

## Common I/O Patterns and Utilities

Rust's standard library provides several utilities to make I/O operations easier.

### Reading an Entire File at Once

```rust
use std::fs;

fn main() {
    // Read entire file into a string
    let contents = fs::read_to_string("output.txt")
        .expect("Failed to read file");
    
    println!("File contents: {}", contents);
    
    // Read entire file into a byte vector
    let bytes = fs::read("output.txt")
        .expect("Failed to read file");
    
    println!("File size: {} bytes", bytes.len());
}
```

These helpers simplify common operations where you need the entire file contents.

### Writing an Entire File at Once

```rust
use std::fs;

fn main() {
    // Write a string to a file
    fs::write("quick_output.txt", "This is a quick test")
        .expect("Failed to write file");
    
    // Write bytes to a file
    let data = vec![72, 101, 108, 108, 111]; // "Hello" in ASCII
    fs::write("binary_output.txt", data)
        .expect("Failed to write file");
    
    println!("Files written successfully");
}
```

### Working with Paths

The `std::path` module helps with platform-independent path handling:

```rust
use std::path::Path;
use std::fs;

fn main() {
    let path = Path::new("data").join("config.txt");
    
    println!("Path: {}", path.display());
    
    if !path.exists() {
        // Create directories if they don't exist
        fs::create_dir_all(path.parent().unwrap())
            .expect("Failed to create directories");
        
        // Write to the file
        fs::write(&path, "Configuration data")
            .expect("Failed to write config file");
        
        println!("Created file at: {}", path.display());
    }
}
```

This code creates a path using the platform's path separator and handles directory creation.

## Real-World Example: Simple Note-Taking App

Let's build a simple note-taking application that demonstrates various I/O concepts:

```rust
use std::fs::{self, OpenOptions};
use std::io::{self, Write, BufRead, BufReader};
use std::path::Path;

fn main() -> io::Result<()> {
    let notes_file = "notes.txt";
    
    loop {
        println!("
=== Simple Notes App ===");
        println!("1. View all notes");
        println!("2. Add a new note");
        println!("3. Exit");
        println!("Enter your choice (1-3):");
        
        let choice = read_user_input()?;
        
        match choice.trim() {
            "1" => view_notes(notes_file)?,
            "2" => add_note(notes_file)?,
            "3" => {
                println!("Goodbye!");
                break;
            }
            _ => println!("Invalid choice, please try again."),
        }
    }
    
    Ok(())
}

fn read_user_input() -> io::Result<String> {
    let mut input = String::new();
    io::stdin().read_line(&mut input)?;
    Ok(input)
}

fn view_notes(file_path: &str) -> io::Result<()> {
    if !Path::new(file_path).exists() {
        println!("No notes found.");
        return Ok(());
    }
    
    let file = fs::File::open(file_path)?;
    let reader = BufReader::new(file);
    
    println!("
=== Your Notes ===");
    let mut note_found = false;
    
    for (index, line) in reader.lines().enumerate() {
        let line = line?;
        if !line.trim().is_empty() {
            println!("{}. {}", index + 1, line);
            note_found = true;
        }
    }
    
    if !note_found {
        println!("No notes found.");
    }
    
    Ok(())
}

fn add_note(file_path: &str) -> io::Result<()> {
    println!("Enter your note (press Enter when done):");
    let note = read_user_input()?;
    
    if note.trim().is_empty() {
        println!("Note cannot be empty.");
        return Ok(());
    }
    
    // Open file in append mode or create if it doesn't exist
    let mut file = OpenOptions::new()
        .create(true)
        .append(true)
        .open(file_path)?;
    
    // Write the note
    writeln!(file, "{}", note.trim())?;
    println!("Note added successfully!");
    
    Ok(())
}
```

This example demonstrates:
- User input processing
- File reading and writing
- Error handling with the `?` operator
- File opening with specific options
- Structured application flow
