# Go CLI

## Introduction

The Go Command Line Interface (CLI) is a powerful set of tools that comes bundled with the Go programming language. These command-line utilities help you manage Go projects, build executables, test your code, and perform various other essential development tasks. As a beginner, understanding the Go CLI is crucial as it forms the foundation of your Go development workflow.

The Go CLI follows Go's philosophy of simplicity and effectiveness. With just a handful of commands, you can accomplish most of the tasks needed during Go development. In this guide, we'll explore the most important Go CLI commands, their usage, and provide practical examples to help you become comfortable using them in your projects.

## Getting Started with Go CLI

### Checking Your Go Installation

Before diving into the various CLI commands, let's verify that Go is properly installed on your system.

```bash
go version
```

**Output:**
```
go version go1.21.1 darwin/amd64
```

The output shows the installed Go version and your system architecture. If you see something similar, your Go installation is working correctly!

### Getting Help

The Go CLI includes built-in help that provides information about available commands and their usage.

```bash
go help
```

**Output:**
```
Go is a tool for managing Go source code.

Usage:

	go <command> [arguments]

The commands are:

	bug         start a bug report
	build       compile packages and dependencies
	clean       remove object files and cached files
	doc         show documentation for package or symbol
	env         print Go environment information
	fix         update packages to use new APIs
	fmt         gofmt (reformat) package sources
	generate    generate Go files by processing source
	get         add dependencies to current module and install them
	install     compile and install packages and dependencies
	list        list packages or modules
	mod         module maintenance
	work        workspace maintenance
	run         compile and run Go program
	test        test packages
	tool        run specified go tool
	version     print Go version
	vet         report likely mistakes in packages

Use "go help <command>" for more information about a command.
```

For detailed help on a specific command:

```bash
go help <command>
```

For example:

```bash
go help build
```

## Essential Go CLI Commands

### 1. `go run` - Compile and Run Go Programs

The `go run` command is perfect for quick testing during development. It compiles and runs your Go program in one step, without creating a permanent executable.

```bash
go run main.go
```

Let's see a practical example:

```go
// main.go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, Go CLI!")
}
```

Running this file:

```bash
go run main.go
```

**Output:**
```
Hello, Go CLI!
```

You can also run multiple files:

```bash
go run file1.go file2.go file3.go
```

Or run all files in the current package:

```bash
go run .
```

### 2. `go build` - Compile Go Programs

The `go build` command compiles your Go code into an executable file.

```bash
go build main.go
```

This will create an executable named after your file (`main` or `main.exe` on Windows). You can then run it directly:

```bash
./main
```

**Output:**
```
Hello, Go CLI!
```

To specify a custom output name:

```bash
go build -o myapp main.go
```

Building an entire package:

```bash
go build .
```

Building with optimizations for production:

```bash
go build -ldflags="-s -w" main.go
```

### 3. `go install` - Compile and Install Go Programs

The `go install` command compiles and installs packages to the Go bin directory, making them available system-wide.

```bash
go install github.com/username/project@latest
```

This will install the latest version of the specified package. The executable will be placed in `$GOPATH/bin` or `$GOBIN` if set.

### 4. `go get` - Download and Install Packages

The `go get` command downloads and installs packages and their dependencies.

```bash
go get github.com/gorilla/mux
```

In Go modules mode (Go 1.16+), it updates your `go.mod` file and downloads the dependency:

```bash
go get -u github.com/gorilla/mux
```

The `-u` flag updates the package to the latest version.

### 5. `go mod` - Manage Modules

Go modules provide dependency management for Go projects. Here are some common `go mod` commands:

Initialize a new module:

```bash
go mod init github.com/username/project
```

**Output:**
```
go: creating new go.mod: module github.com/username/project
```

This creates a `go.mod` file:

```
module github.com/username/project

go 1.21
```

Tidy up the module's dependencies:

```bash
go mod tidy
```

This command adds missing dependencies and removes unused ones.

View the module's dependencies:

```bash
go mod graph
```

### 6. `go test` - Test Your Code

Go has built-in testing support through the `go test` command.

Consider this simple function and its test:

```go
// math.go
package math

func Add(a, b int) int {
    return a + b
}
```

```go
// math_test.go
package math

import "testing"

func TestAdd(t *testing.T) {
    got := Add(2, 3)
    want := 5
    if got != want {
        t.Errorf("Add(2, 3) = %d; want %d", got, want)
    }
}
```

Run the test:

```bash
go test
```

**Output:**
```
PASS
ok      github.com/username/project/math   0.007s
```

For verbose output:

```bash
go test -v
```

**Output:**
```
=== RUN   TestAdd
--- PASS: TestAdd (0.00s)
PASS
ok      github.com/username/project/math   0.008s
```

Run tests with code coverage:

```bash
go test -cover
```

**Output:**
```
PASS
coverage: 100.0% of statements
ok      github.com/username/project/math   0.007s
```

### 7. `go fmt` - Format Your Code

Go has a standard code formatting style, and the `go fmt` command ensures your code adheres to it.

```bash
go fmt main.go
```

Format all files in a package:

```bash
go fmt ./...
```

### 8. `go vet` - Find Suspicious Code

The `go vet` command checks your code for common mistakes and suspicious constructs.

```bash
go vet main.go
```

Examine all packages:

```bash
go vet ./...
```

## Working with Go Workspaces

Go 1.18 introduced the workspace mode, which enables working with multiple modules simultaneously.

Create a workspace:

```bash
mkdir myworkspace
cd myworkspace
go work init
```

Add modules to the workspace:

```bash
go work use ./module1
go work use ./module2
```

## Common Go CLI Workflows

Let's explore some common workflows that combine multiple Go CLI commands:

<div className="mermaid">
{`
graph TD
    A[New Project] --> B[go mod init]
    B --> C[Write Code]
    C --> D[go fmt]
    D --> E[go vet]
    E --> F[go test]
    F --> G[go build/run]
    G -->|Issues Found| C
    G -->|No Issues| H[Release]
    H --> I[go build -ldflags]
`}
</div>

### Setting Up a New Project

```bash
# Create a new directory
mkdir myproject
cd myproject

# Initialize a new module
go mod init github.com/username/myproject

# Create a simple main.go file
echo 'package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, World!")
}' > main.go

# Run the program
go run main.go

# Add a dependency
go get github.com/gorilla/mux

# Tidy up dependencies
go mod tidy
```

### Development Cycle

```bash
# Edit files
vim main.go

# Format code
go fmt ./...

# Check for issues
go vet ./...

# Run tests
go test ./...

# Build and run
go build -o myapp
./myapp
```

## Environment Variables

The Go CLI uses several environment variables that control its behavior:

```bash
go env
```

**Output (sample):**
```
GO111MODULE="on"
GOARCH="amd64"
GOBIN=""
GOCACHE="/Users/username/Library/Caches/go-build"
GOENV="/Users/username/Library/Application Support/go/env"
GOEXE=""
GOFLAGS=""
GOHOSTARCH="amd64"
GOHOSTOS="darwin"
GOINSECURE=""
GOMODCACHE="/Users/username/go/pkg/mod"
GONOPROXY=""
GONOSUMDB=""
GOOS="darwin"
GOPATH="/Users/username/go"
GOPRIVATE=""
GOPROXY="https://proxy.golang.org,direct"
GOROOT="/usr/local/go"
GOSUMDB="sum.golang.org"
GOTMPDIR=""

```

Some commonly used environment variables:

- `GOPATH`: Where Go looks for packages
- `GOROOT`: The Go installation directory
- `GOBIN`: Where Go installs binaries
- `GOOS` and `GOARCH`: Target operating system and architecture

## Cross-Compilation

Go makes it easy to compile for different platforms:

```bash
# Build for Windows from a Mac or Linux
GOOS=windows GOARCH=amd64 go build -o myapp.exe main.go

# Build for Linux from any platform
GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build -o myapp-linux main.go

# Build for macOS
GOOS=darwin GOARCH=amd64 go build -o myapp-mac main.go
```

## Exercises

1. Create a new Go module and write a simple "Hello, World!" program. Use the Go CLI to run and build it.

2. Add a dependency to your project (e.g., `github.com/gorilla/mux`) using `go get`. Modify your program to use this dependency.

3. Write a function with tests and use `go test` to verify it works correctly.

4. Create a Go program that can be cross-compiled for three different platforms.

5. Use `go vet` and `go fmt` to clean up a messy Go file (you can intentionally write some code with formatting issues and unused variables).
