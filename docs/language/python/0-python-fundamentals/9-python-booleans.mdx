# Python Booleans

## Introduction

Boolean values are a fundamental data type in Python, representing one of two possible states: `True` or `False`. Named after mathematician George Boole, these values form the basis of logical operations and decision-making in programming. In Python, Booleans are essential for controlling program flow through conditional statements and loops.

Understanding Booleans is crucial as they help answer yes/no questions in your code, which is the foundation of most logical operations in programming.

## Boolean Basics

### The Boolean Data Type

In Python, the Boolean data type has only two possible values:

```python
x = True
y = False
```

You can check the data type using the `type()` function:

```python
print(type(True))  # <class 'bool'>
```

### Boolean as Numbers

Interestingly, in Python, `True` and `False` are actually special cases of integers:

```python
print(True + True)  # 2
print(True * 8)     # 8
print(False * 10)   # 0
```

This is because `True` is treated as `1` and `False` as `0` in numerical operations.

## Comparison Operators

Comparison operators evaluate the relationship between values and return Boolean results.

```python
# Equal to
x = 5
y = 5
print(x == y)  # True

# Not equal to
a = "hello"
b = "world"
print(a != b)  # True

# Greater than and less than
age = 25
print(age > 18)  # True
print(age < 21)  # False

# Greater than or equal to, less than or equal to
score = 75
print(score >= 70)  # True
print(score <= 70)  # False
```

## Logical Operators

Python provides three logical operators to combine Boolean expressions:

### and

Returns `True` if both statements are true:

```python
x = 5
print(x > 3 and x < 10)  # True (both conditions are true)
print(x > 3 and x > 10)  # False (second condition is false)
```

### or

Returns `True` if at least one statement is true:

```python
y = 12
print(y < 5 or y > 10)  # True (second condition is true)
print(y < 5 or y < 10)  # False (both conditions are false)
```

### not

Reverses the result, returning `False` if the result is `True`:

```python
z = 7
print(not(z > 10))  # True (because z > 10 is False)
print(not(z > 5))   # False (because z > 5 is True)
```

## Boolean Methods and Functions

Python's built-in `bool()` function converts values to Booleans according to certain rules:

```python
# Most values evaluate to True
print(bool(1))       # True
print(bool("Hello")) # True
print(bool([1, 2]))  # True

# These values evaluate to False
print(bool(0))       # False
print(bool(""))      # False (empty string)
print(bool([]))      # False (empty list)
print(bool(None))    # False
```

## Truthiness and Falsiness

In Python, values can be evaluated in Boolean contexts without explicitly converting them to Booleans:

### Falsy Values

The following values are considered "falsy" (evaluate to `False`):
- `False`
- `None`
- `0` (zero)
- Empty sequences: `''`, `[]`, `()`
- Empty mappings: `{}`
- Objects that implement `__bool__()` to return `False`

### Truthy Values

Virtually everything else evaluates to `True`:

```python
# Examples of truthy values
if "hello":
    print("Non-empty strings are truthy")  # This will print

if [1, 2, 3]:
    print("Non-empty lists are truthy")    # This will print

if 42:
    print("Non-zero numbers are truthy")   # This will print
```

## Practical Examples

### User Authentication

```python
def is_valid_user(username, password):
    stored_username = "admin"
    stored_password = "secure123"
    
    is_username_valid = (username == stored_username)
    is_password_valid = (password == stored_password)
    
    return is_username_valid and is_password_valid

# Example usage
print(is_valid_user("admin", "secure123"))  # True
print(is_valid_user("admin", "wrong"))      # False
```

### Filtering Lists

```python
ages = [18, 21, 14, 32, 17, 25, 19]

# Filter adults (age 18 or older)
adults = [age for age in ages if age >= 18]
print(adults)  # [18, 21, 32, 25, 19]

# Check if all people are adults
all_adults = all(age >= 18 for age in ages)
print(all_adults)  # False

# Check if at least one person is underage
has_underage = any(age < 18 for age in ages)
print(has_underage)  # True
```

### Input Validation

```python
def validate_input(user_input):
    # Check if input is not empty
    if not user_input:
        return False
    
    # Check if input is within valid range
    try:
        value = int(user_input)
        return 1 <= value <= 100
    except ValueError:
        return False

# Example usage
print(validate_input("42"))    # True
print(validate_input(""))      # False
print(validate_input("101"))   # False
print(validate_input("abc"))   # False
```

## Advanced Boolean Operations

### Short-Circuit Evaluation

Python uses short-circuit evaluation with the `and` and `or` operators:

```python
# With 'and', if the first expression is False, the second one is not evaluated
x = False
y = True
result = x and print("This won't print")  # The print function is not executed

# With 'or', if the first expression is True, the second one is not evaluated
a = True
b = False
result = a or print("This won't print")  # The print function is not executed
```

### The `is` Operator

The `is` operator checks if two variables point to the same object in memory:

```python
a = [1, 2, 3]
b = [1, 2, 3]
c = a

print(a == b)  # True (content is the same)
print(a is b)  # False (different objects in memory)
print(a is c)  # True (same object)
```

### Boolean Operations with Sets

Set operations have Boolean equivalents:

```python
A = {1, 2, 3, 4}
B = {3, 4, 5, 6}

# Intersection (AND)
print(A & B)  # {3, 4}

# Union (OR)
print(A | B)  # {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}

# Difference (in A but not in B)
print(A - B)  # {1, 2}

# Symmetric difference (XOR - in either set but not both)
print(A ^ B)  # {1, 2, 5, 6}
```

## Summary

Booleans in Python represent the values `True` and `False` and are fundamental to logical operations and decision-making in programming. Key points to remember:

1. Boolean values can be created directly with `True` and `False` keywords or through comparison operations
2. Logical operators (`and`, `or`, `not`) combine Boolean expressions
3. Values in Python have "truthiness" - they evaluate to either `True` or `False` in Boolean contexts
4. Booleans are essential for conditional logic in `if` statements, loops, and filter operations
5. Python treats `True` as `1` and `False` as `0` in numerical contexts

Understanding Booleans enables you to write clearer, more efficient code with better control flow and decision-making.

3. Write a program that filters a list of numbers to contain only even numbers.
4. Create a function that checks if a year is a leap year.
5. Implement a simple voting eligibility checker that checks if a person is 18 or older and is a citizen.
