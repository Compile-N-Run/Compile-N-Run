# Python Syntax

Python is known for its clean and readable syntax, making it an excellent language for beginners. In this tutorial, we'll explore Python's basic syntax elements, which form the foundation for all Python programs.

## Introduction

Python syntax refers to the set of rules that define how Python programs are written and interpreted. Unlike many other programming languages that use braces `{}` or keywords to define code blocks, Python uses indentation, which makes the code naturally more readable.

Understanding Python syntax is crucial because:

- It allows you to write code that Python can understand and execute
- It helps you avoid errors and debug your programs effectively
- It enables you to read and understand code written by others

Let's dive into the essential elements of Python syntax!

## Basic Structure of a Python Program

### Comments

Comments are notes in your code that Python ignores during execution. They help document your code for yourself and others.

```python
# This is a single-line comment

"""
This is a
multi-line comment
or docstring
"""
```

### Statements and Lines

In Python, each line typically represents one statement:

```python
print("Hello, World!")  # This is a simple statement
```

You can place multiple statements on one line using semicolons, although this is not recommended for readability:

```python
print("Hello"); print("World")  # Two statements on one line
```

For long statements, you can split them across multiple lines using the backslash `\` or parentheses:

```python
total = 1 + 2 + 3 + \
        4 + 5 + 6   # Using backslash

total = (1 + 2 + 3 +
         4 + 5 + 6)  # Using parentheses
```

## Indentation

Python uses indentation to define code blocks instead of curly braces or keywords. The standard indentation is 4 spaces (not tabs).

```python
# Correct indentation
if True:
    print("This is indented correctly")
    if True:
        print("This is nested and indented correctly")

# Incorrect indentation (will cause IndentationError)
if True:
print("This will cause an error")
```

## Variables and Data Types

In Python, you don't need to declare variable types explicitly. Python is dynamically typed, which means the type is determined at runtime.

### Variable Assignment

```python
name = "John"        # String
age = 30             # Integer
height = 5.9         # Float
is_student = True    # Boolean
```

### Checking Variable Types

```python
name = "John"
print(type(name))    # Output: <class 'str'>

age = 30
print(type(age))     # Output: <class 'int'>
```

### Multiple Assignment

```python
# Assign same value to multiple variables
x = y = z = 0
print(x, y, z)       # Output: 0 0 0

# Assign multiple values to multiple variables
a, b, c = 1, 2, "three"
print(a, b, c)       # Output: 1 2 three
```

## Basic Data Types

### Numeric Types

```python
# Integer
x = 10
print(x, type(x))    # Output: 10 <class 'int'>

# Float
y = 10.5
print(y, type(y))    # Output: 10.5 <class 'float'>

# Complex
z = 1 + 2j
print(z, type(z))    # Output: (1+2j) <class 'complex'>
```

### Strings

```python
# Single quotes
name = 'John'

# Double quotes
message = "Hello, Python!"

# Triple quotes for multi-line strings
paragraph = """This is a
multi-line string
in Python"""

print(name)          # Output: John
print(message)       # Output: Hello, Python!
print(paragraph)     # Output: This is a
                    #          multi-line string
                    #          in Python
```

### Boolean

```python
is_valid = True
is_completed = False

print(type(is_valid))  # Output: <class 'bool'>
```

### Collections

```python
# List (mutable, ordered)
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(fruits)        # Output: ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']

# Tuple (immutable, ordered)
coordinates = (10, 20)
print(coordinates)   # Output: (10, 20)

# Dictionary (key-value pairs)
person = {"name": "John", "age": 30}
print(person)        # Output: {'name': 'John', 'age': 30}

# Set (unique elements)
unique_numbers = {1, 2, 3, 3, 4}
print(unique_numbers)  # Output: {1, 2, 3, 4}
```

## Operators

### Arithmetic Operators

```python
a = 10
b = 3

print(a + b)    # Addition: 13
print(a - b)    # Subtraction: 7
print(a * b)    # Multiplication: 30
print(a / b)    # Division: 3.3333...
print(a // b)   # Floor division: 3
print(a % b)    # Modulus: 1
print(a ** b)   # Exponentiation: 1000
```

### Comparison Operators

```python
a = 10
b = 5

print(a == b)   # Equal to: False
print(a != b)   # Not equal to: True
print(a > b)    # Greater than: True
print(a < b)    # Less than: False
print(a >= b)   # Greater than or equal to: True
print(a <= b)   # Less than or equal to: False
```

### Logical Operators

```python
x = True
y = False

print(x and y)  # Logical AND: False
print(x or y)   # Logical OR: True
print(not x)    # Logical NOT: False
```

## Control Flow Syntax

### If-Else Statements

```python
age = 20

if age < 18:
    print("You are a minor")
elif age >= 18 and age < 65:
    print("You are an adult")
else:
    print("You are a senior")

# Output: You are an adult
```

### For Loops

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)

# Output:
# apple
# banana
# cherry

# Range-based for loop
for i in range(3):
    print(i)

# Output:
# 0
# 1
# 2
```

### While Loops

```python
count = 0

while count < 3:
    print(count)
    count += 1

# Output:
# 0
# 1
# 2
```

## Functions

```python
# Defining a function
def greet(name):
    """This function greets the person passed in as a parameter"""
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

# Calling a function
message = greet("Alice")
print(message)  # Output: Hello, Alice!
```

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Temperature Converter

```python
def celsius_to_fahrenheit(celsius):
    """Convert Celsius to Fahrenheit"""
    fahrenheit = (celsius * 9/5) + 32
    return fahrenheit

def fahrenheit_to_celsius(fahrenheit):
    """Convert Fahrenheit to Celsius"""
    celsius = (fahrenheit - 32) * 5/9
    return celsius

# Use the functions
temp_c = 25
temp_f = celsius_to_fahrenheit(temp_c)
print(f"{temp_c}°C is {temp_f}°F")  # Output: 25°C is 77.0°F

temp_f = 98.6
temp_c = fahrenheit_to_celsius(temp_f)
print(f"{temp_f}°F is {temp_c}°C")  # Output: 98.6°F is 37.0°C
```

### Example 2: Simple Grade Calculator

```python
def calculate_grade(scores):
    """Calculate the average score and return the corresponding grade"""
    avg = sum(scores) / len(scores)
    
    if avg >= 90:
        return "A"
    elif avg >= 80:
        return "B"
    elif avg >= 70:
        return "C"
    elif avg >= 60:
        return "D"
    else:
        return "F"

# Test the function
student_scores = [85, 92, 78, 90, 88]
grade = calculate_grade(student_scores)
print(f"Average score: {sum(student_scores) / len(student_scores)}")
print(f"Grade: {grade}")

# Output:
# Average score: 86.6
# Grade: B
```
