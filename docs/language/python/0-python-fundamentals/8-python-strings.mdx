# Python Strings

## Introduction

Strings are one of the fundamental data types in Python. A string is a sequence of characters enclosed within quotation marks. In Python, text data is always represented as strings, making them essential for almost every program you'll write.

In this tutorial, you'll learn:
- How to create and define strings
- Methods to manipulate and format strings
- How to access characters and substrings
- Real-world applications of string manipulation

## Creating Strings in Python

In Python, you can create strings by enclosing text in either single quotes (`'`), double quotes (`"`), or triple quotes (`'''` or `"""`) for multi-line strings.

```python
# Different ways to create strings
single_quoted = 'Hello, Python!'
double_quoted = "Hello, Python!"
triple_quoted = '''This is a
multi-line string
in Python'''
triple_double_quoted = """Another way
to create multi-line
strings"""

print(single_quoted)
print(double_quoted)
print(triple_quoted)
print(triple_double_quoted)
```

**Output:**
```
Hello, Python!
Hello, Python!
This is a
multi-line string
in Python
Another way
to create multi-line
strings
```

The choice between single, double, or triple quotes is often a matter of preference, but there are practical reasons to choose one over the other:

- Single quotes are convenient when the string itself contains double quotes
- Double quotes are useful when the string contains apostrophes or single quotes
- Triple quotes are perfect for multi-line text or docstrings

```python
# When to use different quotes
sentence_with_quotes = "He said, \"Python is amazing!\""
alternative = 'He said, "Python is amazing!"'

apostrophe_example = "Don't worry about using apostrophes"
alternative_apostrophe = 'Don\'t worry about using apostrophes'

print(sentence_with_quotes)
print(alternative)
print(apostrophe_example)
print(alternative_apostrophe)
```

**Output:**
```
He said, "Python is amazing!"
He said, "Python is amazing!"
Don't worry about using apostrophes
Don't worry about using apostrophes
```

## String Length and Accessing Characters

### Finding String Length

To find the length of a string in Python, use the `len()` function:

```python
message = "Hello, World!"
length = len(message)
print(f"The message contains {length} characters")
```

**Output:**
```
The message contains 13 characters
```

### Accessing Characters by Index

Python strings are sequences of characters, and you can access individual characters using indexing. Remember that indexing in Python starts at 0:

```python
message = "Python"
print(message[0])  # First character
print(message[1])  # Second character
print(message[-1])  # Last character
print(message[-2])  # Second-to-last character
```

**Output:**
```
P
y
n
o
```

### Slicing Strings

You can extract a substring using slicing with the syntax `string[start:end]`. Note that the `end` index is exclusive (up to but not including):

```python
message = "Python Programming"
print(message[0:6])    # Characters from index 0 to 5
print(message[7:])     # Characters from index 7 to the end
print(message[:6])     # Characters from the beginning to index 5
print(message[-11:])   # Last 11 characters
```

**Output:**
```
Python
Programming
Python
Programming
```

You can also use a third parameter as a step value to skip characters:

```python
message = "Python Programming"
print(message[0:18:2])  # Every second character from index 0 to 17
print(message[::-1])    # Reverse the string
```

**Output:**
```
Pto rgamn
gnimmargorP nohtyP
```

## String Manipulation and Methods

Python provides a rich set of methods for string manipulation. Let's explore the most common ones:

### String Concatenation

You can join strings using the `+` operator:

```python
first_name = "John"
last_name = "Doe"
full_name = first_name + " " + last_name
print(full_name)
```

**Output:**
```
John Doe
```

### String Repetition

Repeat a string multiple times using the `*` operator:

```python
pattern = "-" * 10
print(pattern)
```

**Output:**
```
----------
```

### Case Conversion

Convert strings to uppercase, lowercase, or title case:

```python
message = "python is fun"
print(message.upper())      # All uppercase
print(message.lower())      # All lowercase
print(message.capitalize()) # First character uppercase, rest lowercase
print(message.title())      # First character of each word uppercase
```

**Output:**
```
PYTHON IS FUN
python is fun
Python is fun
Python Is Fun
```

### Stripping Whitespace

Remove whitespace from the beginning and/or end of a string:

```python
text = "   Python   "
print(f"Original: '{text}'")
print(f"strip(): '{text.strip()}'")     # Remove whitespace from both ends
print(f"lstrip(): '{text.lstrip()}'")   # Remove whitespace from left end
print(f"rstrip(): '{text.rstrip()}'")   # Remove whitespace from right end
```

**Output:**
```
Original: '   Python   '
strip(): 'Python'
lstrip(): 'Python   '
rstrip(): '   Python'
```

### Finding and Replacing

Search for substrings and replace content:

```python
message = "Python is amazing. Python is powerful."

# Find first occurrence
print(message.find("Python"))  # Returns the index where "Python" first appears
print(message.find("Java"))    # Returns -1 if not found

# Count occurrences
print(message.count("Python"))

# Replace occurrences
new_message = message.replace("Python", "JavaScript")
print(new_message)
```

**Output:**
```
0
-1
2
JavaScript is amazing. JavaScript is powerful.
```

### Checking String Properties

Validate string content with boolean methods:

```python
# Check if string consists of specific character types
print("123".isdigit())       # Only digits?
print("abc123".isalnum())    # Only alphanumeric characters?
print("PYTHON".isupper())    # Only uppercase?
print("python".islower())    # Only lowercase?
print("  ".isspace())        # Only whitespace?

# Check beginning and ending
file_name = "document.pdf"
print(file_name.startswith("doc"))
print(file_name.endswith(".pdf"))
```

**Output:**
```
True
True
True
True
True
True
True
```

### Splitting and Joining Strings

Split a string into a list or join a list of strings:

```python
# Split string into a list
sentence = "Python is a programming language"
words = sentence.split()  # Split by whitespace by default
print(words)

csv_data = "John,Doe,30,New York"
fields = csv_data.split(",")
print(fields)

# Join list elements into a string
joined_words = " ".join(words)
print(joined_words)

joined_with_dash = "-".join(words)
print(joined_with_dash)
```

**Output:**
```
['Python', 'is', 'a', 'programming', 'language']
['John', 'Doe', '30', 'New York']
Python is a programming language
Python-is-a-programming-language
```

## String Formatting

Python offers several ways to format strings:

### 1. f-strings (Python 3.6+)

The most readable and recommended way to format strings:

```python
name = "Alice"
age = 30
message = f"Hello, {name}! You are {age} years old."
print(message)

# You can include expressions inside the brackets
price = 49.95
print(f"The price is ${price:.2f}")
```

**Output:**
```
Hello, Alice! You are 30 years old.
The price is $49.95
```

### 2. `format()` Method

The `str.format()` method is also widely used:

```python
name = "Bob"
age = 25
message = "Hello, {}! You are {} years old.".format(name, age)
print(message)

# You can use numbered or named placeholders
message = "Hello, {0}! You are {1} years old. {0} is a nice name.".format(name, age)
print(message)

message = "Hello, {person}! You are {years} years old.".format(person=name, years=age)
print(message)
```

**Output:**
```
Hello, Bob! You are 25 years old.
Hello, Bob! You are 25 years old. Bob is a nice name.
Hello, Bob! You are 25 years old.
```

### 3. Old-style String Formatting (% operator)

While less recommended for new code, you might see this in older Python programs:

```python
name = "Charlie"
age = 35
message = "Hello, %s! You are %d years old." % (name, age)
print(message)
```

**Output:**
```
Hello, Charlie! You are 35 years old.
```

## String Immutability

In Python, strings are immutable, which means once a string is created, it cannot be changed. Any operation that appears to modify a string actually creates a new string:

```python
message = "Hello"
print(id(message))  # Memory address of the original string

# This doesn't modify the original string, it creates a new one
message = message + " World"
print(id(message))  # Different memory address for the new string
```

Understanding this immutability is important when working with large amounts of string data, as it affects performance considerations.

## Real-world Applications

Let's look at some practical examples of string manipulation:

### 1. Data Validation

Checking if a string is a valid email address:

```python
def is_valid_email(email):
    # A simple validation - email must contain @ and .
    if not isinstance(email, str):
        return False
    
    if '@' not in email:
        return False
        
    # Split the email into username and domain
    username, domain = email.split('@', 1)
    
    if not username or not domain:
        return False
        
    if '.' not in domain:
        return False
        
    return True
    
# Test the function
emails = ["user@example.com", "invalid.email", "user@domain", 12345]
for email in emails:
    print(f"{email}: {is_valid_email(email)}")
```

**Output:**
```
user@example.com: True
invalid.email: False
user@domain: False
12345: False
```

### 2. Text Processing

Creating a simple word frequency counter:

```python
def word_frequency(text):
    # Convert to lowercase and split into words
    words = text.lower().split()
    
    # Remove punctuation from each word
    cleaned_words = []
    for word in words:
        cleaned_word = ""
        for char in word:
            if char.isalnum():
                cleaned_word += char
        cleaned_words.append(cleaned_word)
    
    # Count word frequencies
    frequency = {}
    for word in cleaned_words:
        if word:  # Skip empty strings
            frequency[word] = frequency.get(word, 0) + 1
            
    return frequency

sample_text = """Python is an interpreted, high-level, 
general-purpose programming language. Python's design philosophy 
emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace."""

result = word_frequency(sample_text)

# Print the 5 most common words
from collections import Counter
top_5 = Counter(result).most_common(5)
print("Top 5 words:")
for word, count in top_5:
    print(f"{word}: {count}")
```

**Output:**
```
Top 5 words:
python: 2
is: 2
programming: 1
language: 1
pythons: 1
```

### 3. Template System

Creating a simple template engine:

```python
def render_template(template, **kwargs):
    """Replace placeholders in a template with provided values."""
    result = template
    for key, value in kwargs.items():
        placeholder = f"{{{key}}}"
        result = result.replace(placeholder, str(value))
    return result

# Email template
email_template = """
Hello {name},

Thank you for your purchase of {product} for ${price}.
Your order #{order_id} will be shipped on {ship_date}.

Best regards,
{company} Support Team
"""

# Render the template with specific values
email = render_template(
    email_template,
    name="John Smith",
    product="Python Cookbook",
    price="39.99",
    order_id="ORD-12345",
    ship_date="2023-05-15",
    company="PythonBooks"
)

print(email)
```

**Output:**
```

Hello John Smith,

- Creating strings with single, double, and triple quotes
- Accessing characters and substrings using indexing and slicing
- Manipulating strings with various methods like `upper()`, `lower()`, `replace()`, `split()`, and `join()`
- Formatting strings using f-strings, the `format()` method, and % operators
- The concept of string immutability
- Real-world applications of string manipulation

Python's rich collection of string methods makes text processing tasks much easier than in many other programming languages. As you continue learning Python, you'll find that string manipulation skills are fundamental to many programming tasks.

## Exercises

To reinforce your learning, try these exercises:

1. Create a function that counts the number of vowels in a string.
2. Write a program that reverses each word in a sentence while keeping the word order.
3. Implement a function that converts snake_case to camelCase (e.g., "hello_world" → "helloWorld").
4. Create a simple CSV parser that takes a string with comma-separated values and returns a list of lists.
5. Write a function that validates if a given string is a valid password based on criteria like length, presence of uppercase, lowercase, and special characters.
