# Python First Class Functions

## Introduction

In Python, functions are treated as "first-class citizens" or "first-class objects." This is a fundamental concept in functional programming that means functions can be treated just like any other object (like integers, strings, or lists). In this tutorial, we'll explore what it means for functions to be first-class objects and how this enables powerful programming patterns and techniques.

## What Are First-Class Functions?

A programming language is said to have first-class functions when functions in that language are treated like any other variable. In Python, this means you can:

1. Assign functions to variables
2. Pass functions as arguments to other functions
3. Return functions from other functions
4. Store functions in data structures like lists and dictionaries

This flexibility allows for more expressive and concise code, especially when implementing functional programming paradigms.

## Assigning Functions to Variables

In Python, you can assign a function to a variable, just like any other object.

```python
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

# Assigning the function to a variable
say_hello = greet

# Using the new variable to call the function
print(say_hello("Alice"))  # Output: Hello, Alice!
```

Notice that we didn't use parentheses when assigning `greet` to `say_hello`. This is because we're not calling the function; we're referring to the function object itself. Both names, `greet` and `say_hello`, now point to the same function object in memory.

## Passing Functions as Arguments

Functions can be passed as arguments to other functions. Functions that accept other functions as arguments are called "higher-order functions."

```python
def apply_operation(x, y, operation):
    return operation(x, y)

def add(a, b):
    return a + b

def multiply(a, b):
    return a * b

# Using the functions as arguments
result1 = apply_operation(5, 3, add)
result2 = apply_operation(5, 3, multiply)

print(result1)  # Output: 8
print(result2)  # Output: 15
```

This pattern is powerful because it allows you to abstract behavior and make your code more flexible and reusable.

## Returning Functions from Functions

Python allows functions to return other functions, creating "function factories" or "closures."

```python
def create_power_function(exponent):
    def power_function(base):
        return base ** exponent
    return power_function

# Create functions that square and cube numbers
square = create_power_function(2)
cube = create_power_function(3)

print(square(4))  # Output: 16
print(cube(4))    # Output: 64
```

In this example, `create_power_function` returns a new function that raises its argument to the specified exponent. The returned function "remembers" the value of exponent that was passed when it was created.

## Storing Functions in Data Structures

Because functions are objects, they can be stored in data structures like lists, tuples, and dictionaries.

```python
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

def subtract(a, b):
    return a - b

def multiply(a, b):
    return a * b

def divide(a, b):
    return a / b if b != 0 else "Error: Division by zero"

# Storing functions in a dictionary
operations = {
    'add': add,
    'subtract': subtract,
    'multiply': multiply,
    'divide': divide
}

# Using functions from the dictionary
a, b = 10, 5
for op_name, operation in operations.items():
    result = operation(a, b)
    print(f"{op_name}: {a} and {b} = {result}")
```

Output:
```
add: 10 and 5 = 15
subtract: 10 and 5 = 5
multiply: 10 and 5 = 50
divide: 10 and 5 = 2.0
```

This technique is especially useful when you need to select operations dynamically based on user input or other conditions.

## Lambda Functions

Python provides an elegant way to create small, anonymous functions using the `lambda` keyword. Lambda functions are often used in functional programming when you need a simple function for a short period of time.

```python
# Traditional function
def double(x):
    return x * 2

# Equivalent lambda function
double_lambda = lambda x: x * 2

print(double(5))        # Output: 10
print(double_lambda(5)) # Output: 10

# Lambda functions are commonly used with built-in functions like map, filter, and sorted
numbers = [1, 5, 3, 9, 2, 6]

# Sort by value
sorted_numbers = sorted(numbers)
print(sorted_numbers)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 9]

# Using lambda with sorted to sort a list of tuples by the second element
pairs = [(1, 'one'), (3, 'three'), (2, 'two'), (4, 'four')]
sorted_pairs = sorted(pairs, key=lambda pair: pair[1])
print(sorted_pairs)  # Output: [(4, 'four'), (1, 'one'), (3, 'three'), (2, 'two')]
```

## Practical Applications

### 1. Callback Functions

Callback functions are functions that are passed as arguments to other functions and are executed at a specific point during the execution of the containing function.

```python
def process_data(data, success_callback, error_callback):
    try:
        # Process the data
        result = [item * 2 for item in data]
        success_callback(result)
    except Exception as e:
        error_callback(str(e))

def on_success(result):
    print(f"Success! Result: {result}")

def on_error(error_message):
    print(f"Error occurred: {error_message}")

# Using the callbacks
process_data([1, 2, 3, 4], on_success, on_error)  
# Output: Success! Result: [2, 4, 6, 8]

process_data("not a list", on_success, on_error)  
# Output: Error occurred: ...
```

### 2. Decorators

Decorators are a powerful pattern in Python that leverages first-class functions to modify or enhance the behavior of functions without changing their code.

```python
def log_execution(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        print(f"Calling {func.__name__} with args: {args}, kwargs: {kwargs}")
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        print(f"{func.__name__} returned: {result}")
        return result
    return wrapper

@log_execution
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

# When we call add, it's actually calling the wrapper function
result = add(3, 5)  
# Output:
# Calling add with args: (3, 5), kwargs: {}
# add returned: 8
```

### 3. Function Composition

Function composition is combining simple functions to build more complicated ones. First-class functions make this pattern elegant in Python.

```python
def compose(f, g):
    return lambda x: f(g(x))

def double(x):
    return x * 2

def increment(x):
    return x + 1

# Create a new function that doubles and then increments
double_then_increment = compose(increment, double)

# Create a new function that increments and then doubles
increment_then_double = compose(double, increment)

print(double_then_increment(3))  # Output: 7 (double: 3*2=6, then increment: 6+1=7)
print(increment_then_double(3))  # Output: 8 (increment: 3+1=4, then double: 4*2=8)
```

## Summary

In this tutorial, we've explored the concept of first-class functions in Python, which is a key feature that enables functional programming patterns. We've seen that Python functions can be:

- Assigned to variables
- Passed as arguments to other functions
- Returned from other functions
- Stored in data structures

We've also looked at practical applications such as callback functions, decorators, and function composition. These patterns allow for more expressive, modular, and reusable code, which are fundamental goals in functional programming.
