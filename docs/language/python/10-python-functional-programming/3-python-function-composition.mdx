# Python Function Composition

## Introduction

Function composition is a fundamental concept in functional programming that allows you to combine multiple functions to create new functions. The output of one function becomes the input of another, creating a chain of operations. This concept lets you build complex operations from simple, modular functions, making your code more reusable, readable, and maintainable.

In mathematical notation, function composition is written as (f ∘ g)(x) = f(g(x)). In Python terms, this means applying function `f` to the result of applying function `g` to `x`.

## Basic Function Composition

Let's start with a simple example of function composition using regular Python functions.

```python
def double(x):
    return x * 2

def increment(x):
    return x + 1

# Manual composition
result = double(increment(5))
print(result)  # Output: 12
```

In this example:
1. `increment(5)` returns `6`
2. `double(6)` returns `12`

However, manually composing functions like this can become cumbersome when dealing with multiple functions. Let's implement a more flexible approach.

## Creating a Compose Function

We can create a helper function that takes multiple functions as arguments and returns a new function that represents their composition:

```python
def compose(*functions):
    """
    Compose any number of functions into a single function.
    Functions are applied from right to left.
    """
    def composed_function(x):
        result = x
        for function in reversed(functions):
            result = function(result)
        return result
    return composed_function

# Usage example
double_then_increment = compose(increment, double)
increment_then_double = compose(double, increment)

print(double_then_increment(5))  # Output: 11
print(increment_then_double(5))  # Output: 12
```

Note that in the `compose` function, we apply the functions from right to left (using `reversed`). This matches the mathematical notation where functions are applied from inner to outer.

## Using `functools.reduce` for Composition

For a more functional approach, we can use `functools.reduce`:

```python
from functools import reduce

def compose(*functions):
    """
    Compose any number of functions using functools.reduce.
    Functions are applied from right to left.
    """
    def compose_two(f, g):
        return lambda x: f(g(x))
    
    if not functions:
        return lambda x: x  # Identity function
    
    return reduce(compose_two, functions)

# Example usage
add_5 = lambda x: x + 5
multiply_by_3 = lambda x: x * 3
square = lambda x: x ** 2

composed = compose(square, multiply_by_3, add_5)
print(composed(10))  # Output: 1225 = (10 + 5) * 3)² = 15² * 3² = 45²
```

The calculation flow is:
1. `add_5(10)` = 15
2. `multiply_by_3(15)` = 45
3. `square(45)` = 2025

## Right-to-Left vs. Left-to-Right Composition

The standard mathematical notation applies functions from right to left. However, you might want to compose functions from left to right for more intuitive code reading. Let's implement both versions:

```python
def compose(*functions):
    """Right-to-left composition (mathematical order)"""
    def composed_function(x):
        result = x
        for function in reversed(functions):
            result = function(result)
        return result
    return composed_function

def pipe(*functions):
    """Left-to-right composition (pipeline order)"""
    def piped_function(x):
        result = x
        for function in functions:
            result = function(result)
        return result
    return piped_function

# Example
add_5 = lambda x: x + 5
multiply_by_3 = lambda x: x * 3

# With compose (right-to-left): first add_5, then multiply_by_3
composed = compose(multiply_by_3, add_5)
print(composed(10))  # Output: 45

# With pipe (left-to-right): first add_5, then multiply_by_3
piped = pipe(add_5, multiply_by_3)
print(piped(10))  # Output: 45
```

The `pipe` function is especially useful when you want to create a data processing pipeline where data flows through a series of transformations in a left-to-right order.

## Real-World Application: Data Processing Pipeline

Function composition is particularly useful for data processing tasks. Let's build a simple text processing pipeline:

```python
def remove_punctuation(text):
    import string
    return ''.join(c for c in text if c not in string.punctuation)

def lowercase(text):
    return text.lower()

def remove_extra_spaces(text):
    return ' '.join(text.split())

def tokenize(text):
    return text.split()

# Create a text processing pipeline
process_text = pipe(
    remove_punctuation,
    lowercase,
    remove_extra_spaces,
    tokenize
)

# Process some text
text = "Hello, World!   This is an Example text...   "
processed = process_text(text)
print(processed)  
# Output: ['hello', 'world', 'this', 'is', 'an', 'example', 'text']
```

This pipeline processes the text in four steps:
1. Removes punctuation
2. Converts to lowercase
3. Removes extra spaces
4. Tokenizes (splits into words)

## Partial Application with Function Composition

Function composition works well with partial application using `functools.partial`:

```python
from functools import partial

def multiply(a, b):
    return a * b

def add(a, b):
    return a + b

# Create specialized functions using partial
multiply_by_2 = partial(multiply, 2)
add_5 = partial(add, 5)

# Compose them
transform = compose(add_5, multiply_by_2)
print(transform(10))  # Output: 25 (10 * 2 + 5)
```

## Composition with Class-based Approach

For more complex scenarios, you might prefer a class-based approach:

```python
class Compose:
    def __init__(self, *functions):
        self.functions = functions
    
    def __call__(self, x):
        result = x
        for function in reversed(self.functions):
            result = function(result)
        return result

# Usage
double = lambda x: x * 2
increment = lambda x: x + 1
square = lambda x: x ** 2

transform = Compose(square, increment, double)
print(transform(3))  # Output: 49 = ((3 * 2) + 1)² = 7² = 49
```

## Error Handling in Function Composition

When composing functions, error handling becomes important:

```python
def safe_compose(*functions):
    """Composition with basic error handling"""
    def composed_function(x):
        result = x
        try:
            for function in reversed(functions):
                result = function(result)
            return result
        except Exception as e:
            return f"Error in composition: {e}"
    return composed_function

# Example with error
def reciprocal(x):
    return 1 / x

safe_transform = safe_compose(square, reciprocal)
print(safe_transform(2))    # Output: 0.25
print(safe_transform(0))    # Output: Error in composition: division by zero
```

## Summary

Function composition is a powerful technique in functional programming that allows us to:
- Combine multiple simple functions into more complex operations
- Create data processing pipelines
- Write more modular, reusable code
- Express complex transformations clearly

By understanding and applying function composition, you can write more elegant, maintainable Python code that follows functional programming principles.
