# Python Functional Tools

Python provides several built-in tools that support functional programming paradigms. These tools allow you to write more concise, readable, and maintainable code by working with functions as first-class objects and applying operations to collections of data in an elegant way.

## Introduction to Functional Programming in Python

Functional programming is a programming paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing state and mutable data. Python, while not a purely functional language, offers several features that support functional programming:

- Functions as first-class objects (can be passed around, stored in variables)
- Lambda expressions (anonymous functions)
- Built-in functions like `map()`, `filter()`, and `reduce()`
- List comprehensions and generator expressions
- Higher-order functions (functions that operate on other functions)

In this tutorial, we'll explore the primary functional tools that Python provides and how to use them effectively.

## The `map()` Function

The `map()` function applies a specified function to each item in an iterable and returns a map object (which is an iterator).

### Syntax

```python
map(function, iterable, ...)
```

### Basic Example

```python
# Convert a list of temperatures from Celsius to Fahrenheit
celsius = [0, 10, 20, 30, 40]
fahrenheit = list(map(lambda c: (9/5) * c + 32, celsius))
print(fahrenheit)  # Output: [32.0, 50.0, 68.0, 86.0, 104.0]
```

### Using `map()` with Regular Functions

```python
def square(x):
    return x ** 2

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
squared = list(map(square, numbers))
print(squared)  # Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
```

### Multiple Iterables with `map()`

```python
# Add corresponding elements from two lists
list1 = [1, 2, 3]
list2 = [10, 20, 30]
added = list(map(lambda x, y: x + y, list1, list2))
print(added)  # Output: [11, 22, 33]
```

## The `filter()` Function

The `filter()` function creates an iterator from elements of an iterable for which a function returns true.

### Syntax

```python
filter(function, iterable)
```

### Basic Example

```python
# Filter out odd numbers
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
even_numbers = list(filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, numbers))
print(even_numbers)  # Output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```

### Using `filter()` with Regular Functions

```python
def is_positive(n):
    return n > 0

numbers = [-5, -3, 0, 2, 7]
positive_numbers = list(filter(is_positive, numbers))
print(positive_numbers)  # Output: [2, 7]
```

### Filtering None Values

```python
# Filter out None values
values = [None, 1, None, 2, None, 3]
valid_values = list(filter(None, values))  # None is treated as False
print(valid_values)  # Output: [1, 2, 3]
```

## The `reduce()` Function

The `reduce()` function applies a function of two arguments cumulatively to the items of an iterable, reducing it to a single value. It is not a built-in function in Python 3, but it's available in the `functools` module.

### Syntax

```python
functools.reduce(function, iterable[, initializer])
```

### Basic Example

```python
from functools import reduce

# Calculate the product of all numbers in a list
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
product = reduce(lambda x, y: x * y, numbers)
print(product)  # Output: 24 (1*2*3*4)
```

### Using `reduce()` with an Initializer

```python
from functools import reduce

# Sum of numbers with an initial value of 10
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
sum_with_init = reduce(lambda x, y: x + y, numbers, 10)
print(sum_with_init)  # Output: 20 (10+1+2+3+4)
```

### More Complex Example

```python
from functools import reduce

# Find the maximum value in a list
numbers = [5, 8, 3, 1, 9, 2]
max_value = reduce(lambda x, y: x if x > y else y, numbers)
print(max_value)  # Output: 9
```

## List Comprehensions

List comprehensions provide a concise way to create lists based on existing lists. They follow the form `[expression for item in iterable if condition]`.

### Basic Syntax

```python
[expression for item in iterable]
```

### With Conditional Filtering

```python
[expression for item in iterable if condition]
```

### Examples

```python
# Square all numbers
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
squares = [x**2 for x in numbers]
print(squares)  # Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]

# Filter even numbers and square them
even_squares = [x**2 for x in numbers if x % 2 == 0]
print(even_squares)  # Output: [4, 16]
```

### Comparison with map() and filter()

The same operation using `map()` and `filter()`:

```python
# Using map and filter
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
even_squares = list(map(lambda x: x**2, filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, numbers)))
print(even_squares)  # Output: [4, 16]
```

## Generator Expressions

Generator expressions are similar to list comprehensions but create generators instead of lists, which can be more memory-efficient for large datasets.

### Syntax

```python
(expression for item in iterable if condition)
```

### Example

```python
# Create a generator of squares
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
square_generator = (x**2 for x in numbers)

# Consuming the generator
print(next(square_generator))  # Output: 1
print(next(square_generator))  # Output: 4
print(list(square_generator))  # Output: [9, 16, 25]
```

## Other Functional Tools in Python

### The `functools` Module

The `functools` module provides higher-order functions and operations on callable objects.

#### `partial()` - Partial Function Application

```python
from functools import partial

def multiply(x, y):
    return x * y

# Create new function with x fixed at 2
double = partial(multiply, 2)
print(double(5))  # Output: 10
```

#### `lru_cache()` - Memoization for Functions

```python
from functools import lru_cache

@lru_cache(maxsize=None)
def fibonacci(n):
    if n < 2:
        return n
    return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)

print(fibonacci(30))  # Output: 832040 (computes much faster with caching)
```

### The `itertools` Module

The `itertools` module provides a collection of tools for handling iterators.

#### `chain()` - Concatenate Iterables

```python
from itertools import chain

list1 = [1, 2, 3]
list2 = [4, 5, 6]
combined = list(chain(list1, list2))
print(combined)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```

#### `cycle()` - Infinite Iteration

```python
from itertools import cycle
import itertools

colors = ['red', 'green', 'blue']
color_cycle = cycle(colors)

# Print the first 7 colors in the cycle
limited = itertools.islice(color_cycle, 7)
print(list(limited))  # Output: ['red', 'green', 'blue', 'red', 'green', 'blue', 'red']
```

## Real-world Applications

### Data Processing Pipeline

```python
# Process a list of customer data to find high-value customers
customers = [
    {"name": "Alice", "spending": 1200, "loyal": True},
    {"name": "Bob", "spending": 800, "loyal": False},
    {"name": "Charlie", "spending": 1500, "loyal": True},
    {"name": "Diana", "spending": 300, "loyal": True},
    {"name": "Edward", "spending": 2000, "loyal": False}
]

# Filter loyal customers
loyal_customers = filter(lambda c: c["loyal"], customers)

# Extract high spenders (>1000)
high_spenders = filter(lambda c: c["spending"] > 1000, loyal_customers)

# Extract just the names
high_value_names = map(lambda c: c["name"], high_spenders)

print(list(high_value_names))  # Output: ['Alice', 'Charlie']
```

### Text Processing

```python
# Process a text file to find frequency of words
from functools import reduce
from collections import Counter

text = "Functional programming is powerful. Functional programming is concise."

# Convert to lowercase and split into words
words = text.lower().split()

# Count word frequency using reduce
word_counts = reduce(
    lambda counts, word: {**counts, word: counts.get(word, 0) + 1},
    words,
    {}
)

print(word_counts)
# Output: {'functional': 2, 'programming': 2, 'is': 2, 'powerful.': 1, 'concise.': 1}

# Alternative with Counter
print(Counter(words))
# Output: Counter({'functional': 2, 'programming': 2, 'is': 2, 'powerful.': 1, 'concise.': 1})
```

## Summary

Python's functional programming tools provide powerful ways to process data with clean, concise code. The key tools we've explored include:

- `map()` for transforming elements in a collection
- `filter()` for selecting elements that meet specific criteria
- `reduce()` for aggregating values in a collection
- List comprehensions and generator expressions for concise data transformations
- Additional utilities from `functools` and `itertools` modules

These tools help you write more declarative code, focusing on what you want to accomplish rather than how to do it step by step.
