# Python Threading Basics

## Introduction

In the world of programming, there often comes a time when you need to perform multiple tasks simultaneously. Imagine downloading several files while also processing data or updating a user interface. This is where **threading** comes into play.

Threading is a technique that allows a program to execute multiple operations concurrently within a single process. In Python, the `threading` module provides a way to create and manage threads, enabling you to write programs that can do several things at once.

In this tutorial, you'll learn:
- What threads are and why they're useful
- How to create and manage threads in Python
- Common threading patterns and best practices
- How to avoid common pitfalls with threading

## Understanding Threads

### What is a Thread?

A thread is the smallest unit of execution within a process. When you run a Python program, you're starting a process that, by default, contains a single thread (the main thread). This thread executes your code sequentially, one statement at a time.

By creating additional threads, you can have multiple sequences of instructions executing concurrently, allowing your program to perform multiple tasks seemingly at the same time.

### Why Use Threads?

Threads are particularly useful for:

1. **I/O-bound tasks**: Operations that spend time waiting for input/output (like reading files, network requests)
2. **Responsive user interfaces**: Keeping UI responsive while performing background tasks
3. **Parallel processing**: Utilizing multiple CPU cores for computation (though with limitations in Python, as we'll discuss)

## Getting Started with Python Threading

To use threading in Python, you first need to import the `threading` module:

```python
import threading
```

### Creating a Simple Thread

The simplest way to create a thread is to instantiate a `Thread` object with a target function:

```python
import threading
import time

def print_numbers():
    for i in range(1, 6):
        time.sleep(1)
        print(f"Number {i}")

# Create a thread
thread = threading.Thread(target=print_numbers)

# Start the thread
thread.start()

print("This will print immediately!")
print("Main thread continues execution...")

# Wait for the thread to finish
thread.join()

print("Thread has finished execution!")
```

Output:
```
This will print immediately!
Main thread continues execution...
Number 1
Number 2
Number 3
Number 4
Number 5
Thread has finished execution!
```

Let's understand what's happening:

1. We define a function `print_numbers()` that prints numbers 1-5 with a 1-second delay between each
2. We create a new thread that will execute this function
3. We start the thread with `thread.start()`
4. The main thread continues executing the next lines immediately
5. We call `thread.join()` to wait for our thread to complete before continuing with the main thread
6. The thread executes in parallel with the main thread until it completes

### Creating Multiple Threads

We can create multiple threads to perform different tasks concurrently:

```python
import threading
import time

def print_numbers():
    for i in range(1, 6):
        time.sleep(1)
        print(f"Number {i}")

def print_letters():
    for letter in 'abcde':
        time.sleep(1.5)
        print(f"Letter {letter}")

# Create threads
thread1 = threading.Thread(target=print_numbers)
thread2 = threading.Thread(target=print_letters)

# Start threads
thread1.start()
thread2.start()

print("Both threads are running...")

# Wait for both threads to finish
thread1.join()
thread2.join()

print("Both threads have finished execution!")
```

Output:
```
Both threads are running...
Number 1
Letter a
Number 2
Number 3
Letter b
Number 4
Letter c
Number 5
Letter d
Letter e
Both threads have finished execution!
```

Notice how the numbers and letters interleave in the output because the two threads are running concurrently.

## Passing Arguments to Threads

You can pass arguments to the target function using the `args` parameter (for positional arguments) or `kwargs` parameter (for keyword arguments):

```python
import threading
import time

def greet(name, delay):
    time.sleep(delay)
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")

# Create threads with arguments
thread1 = threading.Thread(target=greet, args=("Alice", 1))
thread2 = threading.Thread(target=greet, args=("Bob", 2))
thread3 = threading.Thread(target=greet, kwargs={"name": "Charlie", "delay": 3})

# Start all threads
thread1.start()
thread2.start()
thread3.start()

print("All greetings scheduled...")

# Wait for all threads to complete
thread1.join()
thread2.join()
thread3.join()

print("All threads have finished!")
```

Output:
```
All greetings scheduled...
Hello, Alice!
Hello, Bob!
Hello, Charlie!
All threads have finished!
```

## Creating Thread Subclasses

For more complex threading scenarios, you can subclass the `Thread` class and override its `run()` method:

```python
import threading
import time

class CountdownThread(threading.Thread):
    def __init__(self, name, count):
        super().__init__()
        self.name = name
        self.count = count
    
    def run(self):
        print(f"Starting {self.name}")
        for i in range(self.count, 0, -1):
            print(f"{self.name}: {i}")
            time.sleep(1)
        print(f"{self.name} finished!")

# Create thread instances
thread1 = CountdownThread("Thread 1", 5)
thread2 = CountdownThread("Thread 2", 3)

# Start threads
thread1.start()
thread2.start()

# Wait for threads to complete
thread1.join()
thread2.join()

print("All countdown threads have finished!")
```

Output:
```
Starting Thread 1
Thread 1: 5
Starting Thread 2
Thread 2: 3
Thread 1: 4
Thread 2: 2
Thread 1: 3
Thread 2: 1
Thread 2 finished!
Thread 1: 2
Thread 1: 1
Thread 1 finished!
All countdown threads have finished!
```

## Thread Synchronization

When multiple threads access shared resources, problems like race conditions can occur. To prevent these issues, Python provides several synchronization primitives.

### Using Locks

The simplest synchronization tool is the `Lock`:

```python
import threading
import time

# Shared resource
counter = 0
counter_lock = threading.Lock()

def increment_counter(count):
    global counter
    
    for _ in range(count):
        # Acquire the lock before accessing the shared resource
        counter_lock.acquire()
        try:
            # Critical section - only one thread can execute this at a time
            current_value = counter
            time.sleep(0.001)  # Simulate some processing time
            counter = current_value + 1
        finally:
            # Always release the lock, even if an exception occurs
            counter_lock.release()

# Create and start threads
threads = []
for _ in range(5):
    thread = threading.Thread(target=increment_counter, args=(10,))
    threads.append(thread)
    thread.start()

# Wait for all threads to finish
for thread in threads:
    thread.join()

print(f"Final counter value: {counter}")
```

Output:
```
Final counter value: 50
```

Without the lock, the final counter value would likely be less than 50 due to race conditions.

### Using the `with` Statement for Locks

Python's `with` statement provides a cleaner way to use locks:

```python
import threading
import time

counter = 0
counter_lock = threading.Lock()

def increment_counter(count):
    global counter
    
    for _ in range(count):
        # Using with statement - automatically acquires and releases the lock
        with counter_lock:
            current_value = counter
            time.sleep(0.001)  # Simulate some processing time
            counter = current_value + 1

# Create and start threads
threads = []
for _ in range(5):
    thread = threading.Thread(target=increment_counter, args=(10,))
    threads.append(thread)
    thread.start()

# Wait for all threads to finish
for thread in threads:
    thread.join()

print(f"Final counter value: {counter}")
```

Output:
```
Final counter value: 50
```

### Other Synchronization Primitives

Python's `threading` module provides several other synchronization primitives:

1. **RLock** (Reentrant Lock): A lock that can be acquired multiple times by the same thread
2. **Semaphore**: Limits access to a shared resource to a specified number of threads
3. **Event**: Allows one thread to signal an event and other threads to wait for it
4. **Condition**: Provides a way to notify waiting threads when a condition changes
5. **Barrier**: Ensures multiple threads wait for each other at a certain point

## Real-World Example: Multi-threaded Web Scraper

Let's create a simple web scraper that downloads multiple web pages concurrently:

```python
import threading
import requests
import time
from urllib.parse import urlparse

class WebsiteDownloader(threading.Thread):
    def __init__(self, url):
        super().__init__()
        self.url = url
        self.result = None
        
    def run(self):
        print(f"Downloading {self.url}")
        try:
            response = requests.get(self.url, timeout=10)
            domain = urlparse(self.url).netloc
            self.result = (domain, len(response.text), response.status_code)
            print(f"Finished downloading {self.url}")
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error downloading {self.url}: {e}")
            self.result = (self.url, 0, 0)

# List of websites to download
websites = [
    "https://www.python.org",
    "https://www.google.com",
    "https://www.github.com",
    "https://www.stackoverflow.com",
    "https://www.wikipedia.org"
]

# Record start time
start_time = time.time()

# Create and start threads
downloaders = []
for url in websites:
    downloader = WebsiteDownloader(url)
    downloaders.append(downloader)
    downloader.start()

# Wait for all downloads to complete
for downloader in downloaders:
    downloader.join()

# Collect and display results
results = [downloader.result for downloader in downloaders]
results.sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)  # Sort by content length

print("\nResults:")
print("=" * 50)
print(f"{'Domain':<25} {'Content Length':<15} {'Status':<10}")
print("-" * 50)
for domain, length, status in results:
    print(f"{domain:<25} {length:<15,} {status:<10}")

# Calculate and display total time
total_time = time.time() - start_time
print("\nTotal execution time: {:.2f} seconds".format(total_time))

# For comparison, calculate time for sequential downloads
print("\nSimulating sequential download time...")
seq_start_time = time.time()

for url in websites:
    try:
        print(f"Downloading {url}")
        response = requests.get(url, timeout=10)
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error downloading {url}: {e}")

seq_total_time = time.time() - seq_start_time
print("Sequential execution time: {:.2f} seconds".format(seq_total_time))
print(f"Threading speedup: {seq_total_time/total_time:.2f}x faster")
```

Output (actual timings and content lengths will vary):

## Common Threading Issues and Best Practices

### The Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)

Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) is a mutex that protects access to Python objects, preventing multiple threads from executing Python bytecode simultaneously. This means:

- Threading in Python is most effective for I/O-bound tasks (like network or file operations)
- CPU-bound tasks (heavy computations) may not see performance improvements with threading
- For CPU-bound tasks, consider using the `multiprocessing` module instead

### Deadlocks

Deadlocks occur when two or more threads are waiting for each other, causing the program to hang indefinitely:

```python
import threading

# Create two locks
lock1 = threading.Lock()
lock2 = threading.Lock()

def thread_1_function():
    with lock1:
        print("Thread 1 acquired lock1")
        # Simulate some work
        import time
        time.sleep(0.1)
        print("Thread 1 waiting for lock2")
        with lock2:
            print("Thread 1 acquired both locks")

def thread_2_function():
    with lock2:
        print("Thread 2 acquired lock2")
        # Simulate some work
        import time
        time.sleep(0.1)
        print("Thread 2 waiting for lock1")
        with lock1:
            print("Thread 2 acquired both locks")

# Create and start threads
thread1 = threading.Thread(target=thread_1_function)
thread2 = threading.Thread(target=thread_2_function)

thread1.start()
thread2.start()

# This line might never get executed due to deadlock
thread1.join()
thread2.join()
print("Both threads completed successfully")
```

To avoid deadlocks:
- Always acquire locks in the same order in all threads
- Use timeouts when acquiring locks
- Consider higher-level synchronization mechanisms

### Best Practices for Threading in Python

1. **Use threading for I/O-bound tasks**: Network requests, file operations, etc.
2. **Keep critical sections small**: Minimize the code protected by locks
3. **Avoid complex lock hierarchies**: Simple locking schemes are less error-prone
4. **Consider thread pools**: Use `concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor` for managing worker threads
5. **Plan for thread safety**: Make your data structures thread-safe or use proper synchronization
6. **Prefer higher-level abstractions**: When possible, use higher-level modules like `concurrent.futures` or `queue`

### Exercises

1. **Basic Thread Exercise**: Create a program that uses threading to count up and down simultaneously, printing the numbers to the console.

2. **Producer-Consumer Pattern**: Implement a producer-consumer pattern using the `queue.Queue` class, where one thread produces items and another consumes them.

3. **Image Processing**: Write a program that loads a folder of images and applies filters to each image using multiple threads.

4. **Thread Pool Exercise**: Modify the web scraper example to use `concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor` instead of managing threads manually.

5. **Threading vs. Multiprocessing Benchmark**: Create a benchmark that compares the performance of threading vs. multiprocessing for both I/O-bound and CPU-bound tasks.

Remember that practice is key to mastering threading concepts. Start with simple examples and gradually move to more complex applications as you become more comfortable with the concepts.
