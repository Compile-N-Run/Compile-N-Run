# Python String Operations

## Introduction

Strings are one of the most commonly used data types in Python. They represent sequences of characters enclosed in quotation marks. Python provides a rich set of operations and methods to manipulate strings efficiently. In this tutorial, we'll explore various string operations that will help you work with text data in your Python programs.

## Basic String Operations

### String Concatenation

Concatenation is the process of joining two or more strings together. In Python, you can use the `+` operator to concatenate strings.

```python
first_name = "John"
last_name = "Doe"
full_name = first_name + " " + last_name
print(full_name)  # Output: John Doe
```

You can also use the `+=` operator to append strings:

```python
greeting = "Hello"
greeting += " World!"
print(greeting)  # Output: Hello World!
```

### String Repetition

The `*` operator repeats a string a specified number of times:

```python
word = "Python "
repeated = word * 3
print(repeated)  # Output: Python Python Python 
```

### String Length

You can find the length of a string using the `len()` function:

```python
message = "Hello, Python!"
length = len(message)
print(length)  # Output: 14
```

## String Indexing and Slicing

### Indexing

Each character in a string has an index. In Python, indices start at 0.

```python
text = "Python"
print(text[0])  # Output: P
print(text[1])  # Output: y
```

You can also use negative indices to access characters from the end of the string:

```python
text = "Python"
print(text[-1])  # Output: n
print(text[-2])  # Output: o
```

### String Slicing

Slicing allows you to extract a substring from a string using the syntax `string[start:end:step]`:

```python
text = "Python Programming"
# Get characters from index 0 to 5 (exclusive)
print(text[0:6])      # Output: Python
# Get characters from index 7 to the end
print(text[7:])       # Output: Programming
# Get characters from the beginning to index 6 (exclusive)
print(text[:6])       # Output: Python
# Every second character 
print(text[::2])      # Output: Pto rgamn
# Reverse the string
print(text[::-1])     # Output: gnimmargorP nohtyP
```

## String Methods

Python provides numerous built-in methods to manipulate strings. Let's explore some of the most common ones:

### Case Conversion Methods

```python
text = "Python Programming"

# Convert to uppercase
print(text.upper())       # Output: PYTHON PROGRAMMING

# Convert to lowercase
print(text.lower())       # Output: python programming

# Capitalize first letter
print(text.capitalize())  # Output: Python programming

# Title case (capitalize first letter of each word)
print(text.title())       # Output: Python Programming

# Swap case (uppercase becomes lowercase and vice versa)
print(text.swapcase())    # Output: pYTHON pROGRAMMING
```

### Search Methods

```python
text = "Python is fun and Python is powerful"

# Check if a string starts with a specific prefix
print(text.startswith("Python"))  # Output: True

# Check if a string ends with a specific suffix
print(text.endswith("powerful"))  # Output: True

# Find the position of a substring
print(text.find("fun"))          # Output: 10
print(text.find("Java"))         # Output: -1 (not found)

# Count occurrences of a substring
print(text.count("Python"))      # Output: 2
```

### Modify Methods

```python
# Replace substrings
text = "Python is fun"
new_text = text.replace("fun", "awesome")
print(new_text)  # Output: Python is awesome

# Strip whitespace
text = "   Python   "
print(text.strip())    # Output: "Python"
print(text.lstrip())   # Output: "Python   "
print(text.rstrip())   # Output: "   Python"

# Join strings
words = ["Python", "is", "fun"]
sentence = " ".join(words)
print(sentence)  # Output: Python is fun

# Split string into a list
text = "Python,Java,C++,JavaScript"
languages = text.split(",")
print(languages)  # Output: ['Python', 'Java', 'C++', 'JavaScript']
```

## String Formatting

Python offers several ways to format strings:

### Formatted String Literals (f-strings)

Introduced in Python 3.6, f-strings provide an elegant way to embed expressions inside string literals:

```python
name = "Alice"
age = 25
message = f"My name is {name} and I am {age} years old."
print(message)  # Output: My name is Alice and I am 25 years old.

# You can also include expressions
price = 49.95
quantity = 5
total = f"Total: ${price * quantity:.2f}"
print(total)  # Output: Total: $249.75
```

### The `format()` Method

```python
name = "Bob"
age = 30
message = "My name is {} and I am {} years old.".format(name, age)
print(message)  # Output: My name is Bob and I am 30 years old.

# Using positional arguments
message = "My name is {0} and I am {1} years old.".format(name, age)
print(message)  # Output: My name is Bob and I am 30 years old.

# Using named arguments
message = "My name is {name} and I am {age} years old.".format(name=name, age=age)
print(message)  # Output: My name is Bob and I am 30 years old.
```

### C-style String Formatting

The older `%` operator can also be used for string formatting:

```python
name = "Charlie"
age = 35
message = "My name is %s and I am %d years old." % (name, age)
print(message)  # Output: My name is Charlie and I am 35 years old.
```

## Real-World Applications

### Example 1: Text Processing

Let's build a simple function that counts the occurrences of each word in a text:

```python
def count_words(text):
    # Convert to lowercase and remove punctuation
    for char in ".,!?;:":
        text = text.replace(char, "")
    
    # Split into words and count
    words = text.lower().split()
    word_count = {}
    
    for word in words:
        if word in word_count:
            word_count[word] += 1
        else:
            word_count[word] = 1
            
    return word_count

sample_text = "Python is amazing! Python is versatile and Python is fun to learn."
result = count_words(sample_text)
print(result)
# Output: {'python': 3, 'is': 3, 'amazing': 1, 'versatile': 1, 'and': 1, 'fun': 1, 'to': 1, 'learn': 1}
```

### Example 2: Creating a Username Generator

This example demonstrates a practical application for string operations by creating usernames from full names:

```python
def generate_username(full_name, birth_year):
    # Convert name to lowercase and remove spaces
    name_parts = full_name.lower().split()
    
    # Take first letter of first name and up to 7 characters of last name
    if len(name_parts) >= 2:
        first_initial = name_parts[0][0]
        last_name_part = name_parts[-1][:7]
        username = f"{first_initial}{last_name_part}{birth_year[-2:]}"
        return username
    else:
        return full_name.lower().replace(" ", "") + birth_year[-2:]

# Test cases
print(generate_username("John Doe", "1990"))         # Output: jdoe90
print(generate_username("Jane Smith", "1985"))       # Output: jsmith85
print(generate_username("Robert Williamson", "2002")) # Output: rwillia02
```

### Example 3: Email Validator

Here's a simple email validator using string operations:

```python
def is_valid_email(email):
    # Check for @ symbol
    if "@" not in email:
        return False
        
    # Split the email into username and domain
    username, domain = email.split("@", 1)
    
    # Check if username and domain are not empty
    if len(username) == 0 or len(domain) == 0:
        return False
        
    # Check if domain has at least one dot
    if "." not in domain:
        return False
        
    # Check if there's text after the last dot
    domain_parts = domain.split(".")
    if len(domain_parts[-1]) < 2:
        return False
        
    # All checks passed
    return True

# Test cases
print(is_valid_email("user@example.com"))     # Output: True
print(is_valid_email("invalid-email"))        # Output: False
print(is_valid_email("user@domain"))          # Output: False
print(is_valid_email("@domain.com"))          # Output: False
```

## Practice Exercises

1. **Name Formatter**: Write a function that takes a person's full name and returns it in the format "Last, First Middle" (e.g., "Smith, John Paul").

2. **Password Validator**: Create a function that checks if a password meets the following criteria:
   - At least 8 characters long
   - Contains at least one uppercase letter
   - Contains at least one lowercase letter
   - Contains at least one digit
   - Contains at least one special character (!@#$%^&*)

3. **URL Parser**: Write a function that takes a URL (e.g., "https://www.example.com/path/page?id=100") and extracts the protocol, domain, path, and query parameters.

4. **Text Statistics**: Create a function that takes a string of text and returns statistics about it (character count, word count, sentence count, average word length).
