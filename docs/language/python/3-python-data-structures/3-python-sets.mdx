# Python Sets

## Introduction

Sets are one of Python's built-in data structures that represent an **unordered collection of unique elements**. If you're familiar with mathematical set theory, Python sets work in much the same way, supporting operations like union, intersection, and difference.

Sets are particularly useful when you need to:
- Store a collection of items where duplicates are not allowed
- Check if an item exists in a collection quickly
- Remove duplicates from a sequence
- Perform mathematical set operations

Unlike lists or tuples, sets are **unordered** (items don't have a specific position) and **mutable** (you can add or remove items), but the elements themselves must be **immutable** (like strings, numbers, or tuples containing immutable elements).

## Creating Sets

### Basic Creation

You can create a set using curly braces `{}` or the `set()` constructor:

```python
# Using curly braces
fruits = {'apple', 'banana', 'cherry'}
print(fruits)

# Using the set() constructor
colors = set(['red', 'green', 'blue'])
print(colors)
```

Output:
```
{'cherry', 'banana', 'apple'}
{'blue', 'green', 'red'}
```

Notice that the order of elements might be different from how they were defined. This is because sets are unordered.

### Creating an Empty Set

To create an empty set, you must use the `set()` constructor. Using empty curly braces `{}` creates an empty dictionary instead:

```python
# Correct way to create an empty set
empty_set = set()
print(type(empty_set))

# This creates an empty dictionary, not a set!
not_a_set = {}
print(type(not_a_set))
```

Output:
```
<class 'set'>
<class 'dict'>
```

### Set with Mixed Data Types

Sets can contain different types of immutable elements:

```python
mixed_set = {42, 'python', (1, 2, 3), True}
print(mixed_set)
```

Output:
```
{42, 'python', True, (1, 2, 3)}
```

### Duplicates Are Automatically Removed

One of the key features of sets is that they automatically eliminate duplicates:

```python
# Duplicates are automatically removed
numbers = {1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5}
print(numbers)
```

Output:
```
{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
```

## Basic Set Operations

### Adding Elements

You can add elements to a set using the `add()` method or update the set with multiple elements using the `update()` method:

```python
# Adding a single element
fruits = {'apple', 'banana', 'cherry'}
fruits.add('orange')
print(fruits)

# Adding multiple elements
fruits.update(['mango', 'grapes'])
print(fruits)

# You can also update with another set, list, tuple, etc.
fruits.update({'pineapple', 'kiwi'}, ['watermelon'])
print(fruits)
```

Output:
```
{'cherry', 'apple', 'banana', 'orange'}
{'mango', 'cherry', 'apple', 'banana', 'grapes', 'orange'}
{'watermelon', 'cherry', 'kiwi', 'apple', 'banana', 'pineapple', 'mango', 'grapes', 'orange'}
```

### Removing Elements

There are several methods to remove elements:

```python
fruits = {'apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'orange', 'kiwi'}

# remove() - raises KeyError if element doesn't exist
fruits.remove('banana')
print(fruits)

# discard() - doesn't raise error if element doesn't exist
fruits.discard('mango')  # No error even though 'mango' isn't in the set
print(fruits)

# pop() - removes and returns an arbitrary element
# Since sets are unordered, you can't control which element gets removed
item = fruits.pop()
print(f"Popped item: {item}")
print(fruits)

# clear() - removes all elements
fruits.clear()
print(fruits)
```

Output:
```
{'cherry', 'apple', 'orange', 'kiwi'}
{'cherry', 'apple', 'orange', 'kiwi'}
Popped item: cherry
{'apple', 'orange', 'kiwi'}
set()
```

## Set Methods and Operations

Sets support mathematical operations that correspond to set theory operations.

### Membership Testing

Checking if an item exists in a set is very efficient:

```python
fruits = {'apple', 'banana', 'cherry'}

print('banana' in fruits)  # True
print('mango' in fruits)   # False
```

Output:
```
True
False
```

### Common Set Methods

```python
set_a = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
set_b = {4, 5, 6, 7, 8}

# union() - returns a new set with elements from both sets
union_set = set_a.union(set_b)
print(f"Union: {union_set}")

# intersection() - returns a new set with elements common to both sets
intersection_set = set_a.intersection(set_b)
print(f"Intersection: {intersection_set}")

# difference() - returns a new set with elements in set_a but not in set_b
difference_set = set_a.difference(set_b)
print(f"Difference (set_a - set_b): {difference_set}")

# symmetric_difference() - returns a new set with elements in either set but not in both
symmetric_difference_set = set_a.symmetric_difference(set_b)
print(f"Symmetric Difference: {symmetric_difference_set}")
```

Output:
```
Union: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}
Intersection: {4, 5}
Difference (set_a - set_b): {1, 2, 3}
Symmetric Difference: {1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8}
```

### Set Operators

Python provides operators that correspond to mathematical set operations:

```python
set_a = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
set_b = {4, 5, 6, 7, 8}

# Union using |
print(f"Union using |: {set_a | set_b}")

# Intersection using &
print(f"Intersection using &: {set_a & set_b}")

# Difference using -
print(f"Difference using -: {set_a - set_b}")

# Symmetric difference using ^
print(f"Symmetric difference using ^: {set_a ^ set_b}")
```

Output:
```
Union using |: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}
Intersection using &: {4, 5}
Difference using -: {1, 2, 3}
Symmetric difference using ^: {1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8}
```

### Update Methods

These methods modify the original set:

```python
set_a = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
set_b = {4, 5, 6, 7, 8}

# update() - adds elements from another set (similar to |=)
set_a_copy = set_a.copy()
set_a_copy.update(set_b)
print(f"After update(): {set_a_copy}")

# intersection_update() - keeps only elements found in both sets (similar to &=)
set_a_copy = set_a.copy()
set_a_copy.intersection_update(set_b)
print(f"After intersection_update(): {set_a_copy}")

# difference_update() - removes elements found in another set (similar to -=)
set_a_copy = set_a.copy()
set_a_copy.difference_update(set_b)
print(f"After difference_update(): {set_a_copy}")

# symmetric_difference_update() - keeps elements in either set but not in both (similar to ^=)
set_a_copy = set_a.copy()
set_a_copy.symmetric_difference_update(set_b)
print(f"After symmetric_difference_update(): {set_a_copy}")
```

Output:
```
After update(): {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}
After intersection_update(): {4, 5}
After difference_update(): {1, 2, 3}
After symmetric_difference_update(): {1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8}
```

### Set Comparison Methods

Sets can be compared to check their relationships:

```python
set1 = {1, 2, 3}
set2 = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
set3 = {6, 7}

# issubset() - returns True if a set is a subset of another
print(f"{set1} is subset of {set2}? {set1.issubset(set2)}")

# issuperset() - returns True if a set contains another set
print(f"{set2} is superset of {set1}? {set2.issuperset(set1)}")

# isdisjoint() - returns True if sets have no elements in common
print(f"{set1} is disjoint with {set3}? {set1.isdisjoint(set3)}")
print(f"{set1} is disjoint with {set2}? {set1.isdisjoint(set2)}")
```

Output:
```
{1, 2, 3} is subset of {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}? True
{1, 2, 3, 4, 5} is superset of {1, 2, 3}? True
{1, 2, 3} is disjoint with {6, 7}? True
{1, 2, 3} is disjoint with {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}? False
```

## Practical Applications of Sets

### Removing Duplicates from a List

One of the most common uses of sets is to remove duplicates from a list:

```python
# Original list with duplicates
numbers = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5]

# Convert to a set to remove duplicates, then back to a list
unique_numbers = list(set(numbers))
print(unique_numbers)

# Note: This method doesn't preserve the original order
# If order matters, use a different approach
```

Output:
```
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

### Finding Unique Elements

Sets make it easy to identify unique elements across collections:

```python
list1 = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'date']
list2 = ['banana', 'date', 'elderberry', 'fig']

# Find items that are in either list (union)
all_fruits = set(list1).union(set(list2))
print(f"All fruits: {all_fruits}")

# Find items that appear in both lists (intersection)
common_fruits = set(list1).intersection(set(list2))
print(f"Common fruits: {common_fruits}")

# Find items that are unique to list1 (difference)
unique_to_list1 = set(list1).difference(set(list2))
print(f"Unique to list1: {unique_to_list1}")

# Find items that are unique to list2 (difference)
unique_to_list2 = set(list2).difference(set(list1))
print(f"Unique to list2: {unique_to_list2}")

# Find items that are in one list but not both (symmetric difference)
in_one_list_only = set(list1).symmetric_difference(set(list2))
print(f"In one list only: {in_one_list_only}")
```

Output:
```
All fruits: {'date', 'apple', 'elderberry', 'banana', 'fig', 'cherry'}
Common fruits: {'date', 'banana'}
Unique to list1: {'apple', 'cherry'}
Unique to list2: {'fig', 'elderberry'}
In one list only: {'apple', 'elderberry', 'fig', 'cherry'}
```

### Checking for Subsets

Sets are useful for determining if one collection is entirely contained within another:

```python
required_skills = {'Python', 'SQL', 'Git'}
candidate_a_skills = {'Python', 'JavaScript', 'HTML', 'SQL', 'Git', 'CSS'}
candidate_b_skills = {'Python', 'JavaScript', 'HTML'}

# Check if a candidate has all required skills
candidate_a_qualifies = required_skills.issubset(candidate_a_skills)
candidate_b_qualifies = required_skills.issubset(candidate_b_skills)

print(f"Candidate A has all required skills: {candidate_a_qualifies}")
print(f"Candidate B has all required skills: {candidate_b_qualifies}")

# What skills is candidate B missing?
missing_skills = required_skills - set(candidate_b_skills)
print(f"Candidate B is missing: {missing_skills}")
```

Output:
```
Candidate A has all required skills: True
Candidate B has all required skills: False
Candidate B is missing: {'SQL', 'Git'}
```

### Frequency Analysis

Sets can help identify unique elements for frequency analysis:

```python
text = "Mississippi is a river and a state in the United States"
words = text.lower().split()

# Find unique words
unique_words = set(words)
print(f"Total words: {len(words)}")
print(f"Unique words: {len(unique_words)}")
print(f"Unique word set: {unique_words}")

# Count frequency of each word
word_freq = {}
for word in unique_words:
    word_freq[word] = words.count(word)

print("\nWord frequencies:")
for word, count in word_freq.items():
    print(f"'{word}': {count}")
```

Output:
```
Total words: 11
Unique words: 10
Unique word set: {'and', 'united', 'is', 'states', 'the', 'river', 'in', 'a', 'state', 'mississippi'}

Word frequencies:
'and': 1
'united': 1
'is': 1
'states': 1
'the': 1
'river': 1
'in': 1
'a': 2
'state': 1
'mississippi': 1
```

## Set Comprehensions

Similar to list comprehensions, Python supports set comprehensions which provide a concise way to create sets:

```python
# Creating a set of squares of numbers from 0 to 9
squares = {x**2 for x in range(10)}
print(squares)

# Creating a set of even numbers from a list
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
even_numbers = {x for x in numbers if x % 2 == 0}
print(even_numbers)

# Converting all words to uppercase in a sentence
sentence = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"
unique_words = {word.upper() for word in sentence.split()}
print(unique_words)
```

Output:
```
{0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81}
{2, 4, 6, 8, 10}
{'THE', 'QUICK', 'BROWN', 'FOX', 'JUMPS', 'OVER', 'LAZY', 'DOG'}
```

## Frozen Sets

Python also provides a variant of sets called "frozenset" which is immutable (cannot be changed after creation):

```python
# Creating a frozen set
frozen = frozenset([1, 2, 3, 4])
print(frozen)

# Trying to modify a frozen set will cause an error
try:
    frozen.add(5)  # This will cause an AttributeError
except AttributeError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")

# Frozen sets can be used as dictionary keys or elements of another set
# Regular sets cannot be used this way
s = {frozenset([1, 2]), frozenset([3, 4])}
print(s)
```

Output:
```
frozenset({1, 2, 3, 4})
Error: 'frozenset' object has no attribute 'add'
{frozenset({1, 2}), frozenset({3, 4})}
```

## Performance Considerations

Sets offer very efficient membership testing with O(1) average time complexity. This makes them ideal for checking if an item exists in a collection:

```python
import time

# Comparing membership testing between list and set
large_list = list(range(1000000))
large_set = set(large_list)
search_item = 999999

# Test with list
start = time.time()
item_in_list = search_item in large_list
list_time = time.time() - start

# Test with set
start = time.time()
item_in_set = search_item in large_set
set_time = time.time() - start

print(f"Time to search in list: {list_time:.6f} seconds")
print(f"Time to search in set: {set_time:.6f} seconds")
print(f"Set is approximately {list_time/set_time:.0f} times faster")
```

Output (values may vary):
```
Time to search in list: 0.032541 seconds
Time to search in set: 0.000001 seconds
Set is approximately 32541 times faster
```

## Summary

Python sets are powerful data structures that offer unique features:

- **Unordered collections** of unique, immutable elements
- **Efficient membership testing** with O(1) average time complexity
- **Mathematical set operations** like union, intersection, and difference
- **Automatic duplicate elimination** when converting from other data structures
- **Mutable** by default, with an immutable variant called `frozenset`

Key use cases for sets include:
- Removing duplicates from sequences

- Finding common or unique elements across collections
- Set operations like union, intersection, and difference
- Efficient frequency analysis and filtering

## Practice Exercises

1. Write a function that takes two lists and returns a list of elements that are common to both lists, without using sets. Then write the same function using sets and compare their performance.

2. Given a list of student names from multiple classes, find the students who are taking all classes.

3. Implement a spell checker that checks if words from input text are present in a dictionary (a large set of valid words).

4. Use sets to solve the classic "Two Sum" problem: given an array of numbers and a target sum, determine if any two numbers in the array add up to the target.

5. Create a function that finds all anagrams in a list of words using sets.
