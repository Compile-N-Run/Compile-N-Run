# Python Tuples

Tuples are one of the fundamental data structures in Python, providing an **immutable ordered collection** of elements. While they might seem similar to lists at first glance, their immutability (inability to change after creation) gives them unique properties and use cases that make them indispensable in Python programming.

## What are Tuples?

A tuple is an ordered collection of items that can contain elements of different data types. The key characteristics that define tuples are:

- **Immutable**: Once created, tuples cannot be modified
- **Ordered**: Elements maintain their order from creation
- **Indexed**: Elements can be accessed by their position
- **Allow duplicates**: Can contain multiple identical elements
- **Heterogeneous**: Can store different data types

Let's explore each of these aspects in detail.

## Creating Tuples

There are several ways to create tuples in Python:

### 1. Using parentheses `()`

```python
# Creating a tuple with multiple elements
fruits = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
print(fruits)

# Creating a tuple with mixed data types
mixed_tuple = (1, "Hello", 3.14, True)
print(mixed_tuple)
```

**Output:**
```
('apple', 'banana', 'cherry')
(1, 'Hello', 3.14, True)
```

### 2. Creating a tuple without parentheses

```python
# Tuple packing - elements are packed into a tuple
coordinates = 10.5, 20.8, 30.2
print(coordinates)
print(type(coordinates))
```

**Output:**
```
(10.5, 20.8, 30.2)
<class 'tuple'>
```

### 3. Creating a single-item tuple

To create a tuple with a single element, you need to include a trailing comma:

```python
# Without comma - not a tuple!
not_a_tuple = ("apple")
print(type(not_a_tuple))

# With comma - this is a tuple
single_item_tuple = ("apple",)
print(type(single_item_tuple))
print(single_item_tuple)
```

**Output:**
```
<class 'str'>
<class 'tuple'>
('apple',)
```

### 4. Creating an empty tuple

```python
empty_tuple = ()
print(empty_tuple)
print(type(empty_tuple))
```

**Output:**
```
()
<class 'tuple'>
```

### 5. Using the `tuple()` constructor

```python
# Convert a list to a tuple
list_to_tuple = tuple([1, 2, 3, 4])
print(list_to_tuple)

# Convert a string to a tuple
string_to_tuple = tuple("Python")
print(string_to_tuple)
```

**Output:**
```
(1, 2, 3, 4)
('P', 'y', 't', 'h', 'o', 'n')
```

## Accessing Tuple Elements

### 1. Using indexing

Tuples use zero-based indexing, just like lists:

```python
colors = ("red", "green", "blue", "yellow", "purple")

# Access the first element
print(colors[0])

# Access the third element
print(colors[2])

# Access the last element
print(colors[-1])

# Access the second-to-last element
print(colors[-2])
```

**Output:**
```
red
blue
purple
yellow
```

### 2. Slicing tuples

You can extract a portion of a tuple using slicing:

```python
numbers = (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)

# Get elements from index 2 to 5 (exclusive)
print(numbers[2:5])

# Get elements from beginning to index 4 (exclusive)
print(numbers[:4])

# Get elements from index 6 to the end
print(numbers[6:])

# Get every second element
print(numbers[::2])

# Reverse the tuple
print(numbers[::-1])
```

**Output:**
```
(2, 3, 4)
(0, 1, 2, 3)
(6, 7, 8, 9)
(0, 2, 4, 6, 8)
(9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0)
```

## Tuple Operations

### 1. Concatenation

You can combine tuples using the `+` operator:

```python
tuple1 = (1, 2, 3)
tuple2 = (4, 5, 6)
combined = tuple1 + tuple2
print(combined)
```

**Output:**
```
(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)
```

### 2. Repetition

You can repeat a tuple's elements using the `*` operator:

```python
repeated = ("Python",) * 3
print(repeated)
```

**Output:**
```
('Python', 'Python', 'Python')
```

### 3. Checking if an element exists

```python
fruits = ("apple", "banana", "cherry", "orange")
print("banana" in fruits)
print("grape" in fruits)
```

**Output:**
```
True
False
```

## Tuple Methods

Unlike lists, tuples have only two built-in methods due to their immutability:

### 1. `count()` - Count occurrences of an element

```python
numbers = (1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 2, 5)
print(numbers.count(2))
```

**Output:**
```
3
```

### 2. `index()` - Find the position of an element

```python
fruits = ("apple", "banana", "cherry", "orange")
print(fruits.index("cherry"))

# Using start and end parameters
mixed = (1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3)
print(mixed.index(1, 1))  # Find 1 starting from index 1
```

**Output:**
```
2
3
```

## Tuple Unpacking

One of the most powerful features of tuples is tuple unpacking, which allows you to assign the elements of a tuple to multiple variables:

```python
# Basic unpacking
coordinates = (10.5, 20.8, 30.2)
x, y, z = coordinates
print(f"x: {x}, y: {y}, z: {z}")

# Swapping values
a, b = 10, 20
print(f"Before: a = {a}, b = {b}")
a, b = b, a  # Tuple unpacking for swapping
print(f"After: a = {a}, b = {b}")

# Using * to collect remaining values
first, *middle, last = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
print(f"First: {first}, Middle: {middle}, Last: {last}")
```

**Output:**
```
x: 10.5, y: 20.8, z: 30.2
Before: a = 10, b = 20
After: a = 20, b = 10
First: 1, Middle: [2, 3, 4], Last: 5
```

## Immutability of Tuples

Tuples are immutable, which means once created, you cannot modify their content. Let's see what happens when we try to change a tuple:

```python
colors = ("red", "green", "blue")
try:
    colors[0] = "yellow"
except TypeError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
```

**Output:**
```
Error: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment
```

However, if a tuple contains mutable objects like lists, those objects can be modified:

```python
mixed_tuple = (1, 2, [3, 4])
print("Original tuple:", mixed_tuple)

# This works because we're not changing the tuple itself,
# but modifying the mutable list inside it
mixed_tuple[2][0] = 30
print("After modifying the list inside:", mixed_tuple)
```

**Output:**
```
Original tuple: (1, 2, [3, 4])
After modifying the list inside: (1, 2, [30, 4])
```

## When to Use Tuples vs Lists

Tuples are preferable over lists in the following scenarios:

1. **When you need immutability**:
   - For data that shouldn't change
   - For dictionary keys (lists can't be used as keys)
   
2. **For heterogeneous data structures**:
   - Representing database records
   - Returning multiple values from a function
   
3. **For performance**:
   - Tuples are slightly more efficient than lists
   - They use less memory and have faster instantiation

```python
# Example: Function returning multiple values as a tuple
def get_user_info():
    name = "Alice"
    age = 30
    is_active = True
    return name, age, is_active  # Implicitly returns a tuple

# Unpacking the tuple returned by the function
user_name, user_age, user_status = get_user_info()
print(f"Name: {user_name}, Age: {user_age}, Active: {user_status}")
```

**Output:**
```
Name: Alice, Age: 30, Active: True
```

## Real-World Applications of Tuples

### 1. Representing Fixed Data

```python
# RGB color values
red = (255, 0, 0)
green = (0, 255, 0)
blue = (0, 0, 255)

# Using the color tuple
def apply_color(color):
    r, g, b = color
    return f"RGB({r}, {g}, {b})"

print(apply_color(red))
```

**Output:**
```
RGB(255, 0, 0)
```

### 2. Geographic Coordinates

```python
# Latitude and longitude pairs
locations = [
    ("New York", (40.7128, -74.0060)),
    ("London", (51.5074, -0.1278)),
    ("Tokyo", (35.6895, 139.6917))
]

for city, (latitude, longitude) in locations:
    print(f"{city}: {latitude}° N, {longitude}° E")
```

**Output:**
```
New York: 40.7128° N, -74.006° E
London: 51.5074° N, -0.1278° E
Tokyo: 35.6895° N, 139.6917° E
```

### 3. Database Records

```python
# Each tuple represents a record (id, name, email, age)
users = [
    (1, "Alice", "alice@example.com", 28),
    (2, "Bob", "bob@example.com", 32),
    (3, "Charlie", "charlie@example.com", 25)
]

for user_id, name, email, age in users:
    print(f"ID: {user_id}, Name: {name}, Email: {email}, Age: {age}")
```

**Output:**
```
ID: 1, Name: Alice, Email: alice@example.com, Age: 28
ID: 2, Name: Bob, Email: bob@example.com, Age: 32
ID: 3, Name: Charlie, Email: charlie@example.com, Age: 25
```

### 4. Dictionary Keys

Since tuples are immutable, they can be used as dictionary keys:

```python
# Using tuples as dictionary keys for a sparse matrix
matrix = {
    (0, 0): 1,
    (0, 2): 3,
    (1, 1): 5,
    (2, 0): 7
}

for coords, value in matrix.items():
    row, col = coords
    print(f"Position ({row}, {col}): {value}")

# Retrieving a specific value
print(f"Value at (1, 1): {matrix.get((1, 1), 0)}")
print(f"Value at (1, 2): {matrix.get((1, 2), 0)}")  # Default to 0 if not found
```

**Output:**
```
Position (0, 0): 1
Position (0, 2): 3
Position (1, 1): 5
Position (2, 0): 7
Value at (1, 1): 5
Value at (1, 2): 0
```

## Converting Between Tuples and Other Types

### 1. Converting a tuple to a list

```python
tuple_data = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
list_data = list(tuple_data)
print(f"Tuple: {tuple_data}")
print(f"List: {list_data}")

# Now you can modify the list
list_data.append(6)
print(f"Modified list: {list_data}")

# Convert back to tuple
new_tuple = tuple(list_data)
print(f"New tuple: {new_tuple}")
```

**Output:**
```
Tuple: (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
List: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Modified list: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
New tuple: (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)
```

### 2. Converting a string to a tuple

```python
text = "Python"
char_tuple = tuple(text)
print(char_tuple)
```

**Output:**
```
('P', 'y', 't', 'h', 'o', 'n')
```

## Nested Tuples

Tuples can contain other tuples, creating nested data structures:

```python
# Representing a tic-tac-toe board
board = (
    ('X', 'O', 'X'),
    ('O', 'X', 'O'),
    ('X', 'O', 'X')
)

# Accessing elements in nested tuples
print(f"Center element: {board[1][1]}")

# Display the board
for row in board:
    print(' | '.join(row))
    if row != board[-1]:
        print('-' * 9)
```

**Output:**
```
Center element: X
X | O | X
---------
O | X | O
---------
X | O | X
```

## Summary

Tuples are powerful data structures in Python that serve specific purposes:

- **Immutable collections** that cannot be changed after creation
- **Ordered and indexed** like lists, but with fixed content
- Efficient for **representing fixed sets of data** where values shouldn't change
- Perfect for **returning multiple values** from functions
- More memory-efficient than lists for storing fixed data
- Can be used as **dictionary keys** unlike lists
- Support **unpacking** which simplifies working with multiple return values

Understanding when to use tuples versus lists is an important aspect of writing clean, efficient, and Pythonic code. When your data will not change and represents a logical grouping of values, tuples are often the best choice.

## Practice Exercises

1. Create a tuple containing the months of the year and print the summer months (June to August).

2. Write a function that takes a tuple of numbers and returns the sum, average, minimum, and maximum values as a tuple.

3. Create a function that converts Cartesian coordinates (x, y) to polar coordinates (radius, angle).

4. Implement a function that takes a list of tuples representing (name, age) pairs and returns a dictionary where names are keys and ages are values.

5. Write a program that stores information about books (title, author, publication year) in tuples and allows the user to search for books by any of these attributes.
