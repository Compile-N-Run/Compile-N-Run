# Python List Methods

Lists are one of the most versatile data structures in Python. They allow you to store collections of items, which can be of different types. To effectively work with lists, you need to understand the various methods Python provides for list manipulation.

## Introduction to List Methods

List methods are built-in functions that are specifically designed to work with lists. They allow you to add, remove, sort, and otherwise manipulate list elements. Understanding these methods is crucial for effective Python programming, as lists are used extensively in most Python applications.

Let's explore the most commonly used list methods with examples and explanations.

## Adding Elements to a List

### `append()` - Add an Element to the End

The `append()` method adds a single element to the end of a list.

```python
fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
fruits.append('orange')
print(fruits)  # Output: ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'orange']
```

### `insert()` - Add an Element at a Specific Position

The `insert()` method adds an element at a specified position.

```python
fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
fruits.insert(1, 'orange')  # Insert at index 1
print(fruits)  # Output: ['apple', 'orange', 'banana', 'cherry']
```

### `extend()` - Append Multiple Elements

The `extend()` method adds all elements from another iterable (like list, tuple, etc.) to the end of the list.

```python
fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
more_fruits = ['orange', 'mango']
fruits.extend(more_fruits)
print(fruits)  # Output: ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'orange', 'mango']
```

## Removing Elements from a List

### `remove()` - Remove a Specific Element

The `remove()` method removes the first occurrence of a specified value.

```python
fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'banana']
fruits.remove('banana')  # Removes only the first 'banana'
print(fruits)  # Output: ['apple', 'cherry', 'banana']
```

### `pop()` - Remove an Element by Index

The `pop()` method removes an element at a specified index and returns it.

```python
fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
removed_fruit = fruits.pop(1)  # Removes and returns 'banana'
print(removed_fruit)  # Output: 'banana'
print(fruits)  # Output: ['apple', 'cherry']

# If no index is specified, it removes and returns the last item
last_fruit = fruits.pop()  # Removes and returns 'cherry'
print(last_fruit)  # Output: 'cherry'
print(fruits)  # Output: ['apple']
```

### `clear()` - Remove All Elements

The `clear()` method removes all elements from the list.

```python
fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
fruits.clear()
print(fruits)  # Output: []
```

### `del` Statement - Delete Elements or the Entire List

While not a method, the `del` statement can remove items or delete the entire list.

```python
fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']

# Delete one item
del fruits[1]
print(fruits)  # Output: ['apple', 'cherry']

# Delete the entire list
del fruits
# print(fruits)  # This would raise an error as 'fruits' no longer exists
```

## Finding Elements in a List

### `index()` - Find the Index of an Element

The `index()` method returns the index of the first occurrence of a specified value.

```python
fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'banana']
position = fruits.index('banana')
print(position)  # Output: 1

# You can also specify a start and end index to search within
position = fruits.index('banana', 2)  # Start searching from index 2
print(position)  # Output: 3
```

### `count()` - Count Occurrences of an Element

The `count()` method returns the number of times a specified value appears in the list.

```python
fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'banana']
banana_count = fruits.count('banana')
print(banana_count)  # Output: 2
```

## Organizing List Elements

### `sort()` - Sort the List

The `sort()` method sorts the list in-place (modifies the original list).

```python
# Sort alphabetically
fruits = ['banana', 'cherry', 'apple']
fruits.sort()
print(fruits)  # Output: ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']

# Sort numerically
numbers = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2]
numbers.sort()
print(numbers)  # Output: [1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9]

# Sort in descending order
numbers.sort(reverse=True)
print(numbers)  # Output: [9, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 1]
```

You can also sort with a custom function using the `key` parameter:

```python
# Sort by string length
words = ['banana', 'pie', 'Washington', 'book']
words.sort(key=len)
print(words)  # Output: ['pie', 'book', 'banana', 'Washington']
```

### `reverse()` - Reverse the List

The `reverse()` method reverses the ordering of the elements in the list.

```python
fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
fruits.reverse()
print(fruits)  # Output: ['cherry', 'banana', 'apple']
```

## Creating Copies of Lists

### `copy()` - Create a Shallow Copy

The `copy()` method returns a shallow copy of the list.

```python
fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
fruits_copy = fruits.copy()
fruits_copy.append('orange')
print(fruits)      # Output: ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
print(fruits_copy) # Output: ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'orange']
```

## Real-world Applications

### Example 1: To-do List Manager

```python
def todo_manager():
    tasks = []
    
    # Add some initial tasks
    tasks.append("Finish homework")
    tasks.append("Buy groceries")
    tasks.append("Call mom")
    
    print("Current tasks:", tasks)
    
    # Complete a task
    completed_task = tasks.pop(0)
    print(f"Completed: {completed_task}")
    print("Remaining tasks:", tasks)
    
    # Add a high priority task
    tasks.insert(0, "Pay bills")
    print("Updated tasks (with high priority):", tasks)
    
    # Add several tasks at once
    more_tasks = ["Clean house", "Exercise"]
    tasks.extend(more_tasks)
    print("All tasks:", tasks)

todo_manager()
```

Output:
```
Current tasks: ['Finish homework', 'Buy groceries', 'Call mom']
Completed: Finish homework
Remaining tasks: ['Buy groceries', 'Call mom']
Updated tasks (with high priority): ['Pay bills', 'Buy groceries', 'Call mom']
All tasks: ['Pay bills', 'Buy groceries', 'Call mom', 'Clean house', 'Exercise']
```

### Example 2: Processing Student Scores

```python
def analyze_scores(scores):
    print(f"All scores: {scores}")
    
    # Find the highest and lowest scores
    scores.sort()
    lowest = scores[0]
    highest = scores[-1]
    print(f"Lowest score: {lowest}")
    print(f"Highest score: {highest}")
    
    # Calculate the average
    average = sum(scores) / len(scores)
    print(f"Average score: {average:.2f}")
    
    # Remove any failing scores (below 60)
    passing_scores = scores.copy()
    while passing_scores and passing_scores[0] < 60:
        passing_scores.pop(0)
    
    print(f"Passing scores: {passing_scores}")
    print(f"Number of passing students: {len(passing_scores)} out of {len(scores)}")

# Test with sample data
student_scores = [88, 72, 91, 45, 63, 94, 59]
analyze_scores(student_scores)
```

Output:
```
All scores: [88, 72, 91, 45, 63, 94, 59]
Lowest score: 45
Highest score: 94
Average score: 73.14
Passing scores: [63, 72, 88, 91, 94]
Number of passing students: 5 out of 7
```

## Summary

Python lists come with powerful built-in methods that make working with collections of data efficient and straightforward. The key methods we've covered include:

1. **Adding elements**: `append()`, `insert()`, `extend()`
2. **Removing elements**: `remove()`, `pop()`, `clear()`, `del`
3. **Finding elements**: `index()`, `count()`
4. **Organizing elements**: `sort()`, `reverse()`
5. **Creating copies**: `copy()`

Understanding these methods will help you manipulate lists effectively in your Python programs, from simple scripts to complex applications.

## Practice Exercises

1. Create a shopping list program that allows adding, removing, and viewing items.
2. Write a function to remove all duplicates from a list while preserving the original order.
3. Create a function that merges two sorted lists into a single sorted list without using `sort()`.
4. Implement a basic playlist manager that can add songs, remove songs, and shuffle the playlist.
