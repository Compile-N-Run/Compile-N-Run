# Python Writing Files

## Introduction

File writing is a fundamental skill in programming that allows your applications to store data permanently. Whether you need to save user inputs, log information, or export data for later use, Python provides robust and straightforward mechanisms for writing to files.

In this tutorial, we'll learn how to create new files, write content to them, and implement proper file handling techniques in Python. We'll start with the basics and gradually move to more advanced scenarios.

## The Basics of Writing Files in Python

### Opening a File for Writing

Before you can write to a file, you need to open it in the appropriate mode. Python provides several modes for file operations:

- `'w'` - Write mode (creates a new file or overwrites an existing one)
- `'a'` - Append mode (adds content to the end of an existing file or creates a new one if it doesn't exist)
- `'x'` - Exclusive creation mode (creates a new file, fails if the file already exists)

Here's how to open a file for writing:

```python
# Opening a file in write mode
file = open("sample.txt", "w")
file.write("Hello, Python File Handling!")
file.close()
```

### Using `with` Statement for Better File Handling

The recommended way to work with files in Python is using the `with` statement, which automatically handles file closure even if errors occur:

```python
# Better approach using with statement
with open("sample.txt", "w") as file:
    file.write("Hello, Python File Handling!")
# File is automatically closed when the block exits
```

## Writing Different Types of Data

### Writing Text Data

For simple text files, the `write()` method is straightforward:

```python
with open("example.txt", "w") as file:
    file.write("This is a single line of text.")
    
    # To write multiple lines
    file.write("\nThis is a second line.")
    file.write("\nThis is a third line.")
```

You can also use `writelines()` for writing multiple lines:

```python
with open("lines.txt", "w") as file:
    lines = ["First line\n", "Second line\n", "Third line\n"]
    file.writelines(lines)
```

Note that `writelines()` doesn't automatically add newline characters, so you'll need to include them if needed.

### Writing Numbers and Other Data Types

When writing numbers or other data types, convert them to strings first:

```python
with open("numbers.txt", "w") as file:
    file.write(str(42) + "\n")
    file.write(str(3.14159) + "\n")
    
    # Writing multiple values on one line
    age = 25
    name = "Alice"
    file.write(f"Name: {name}, Age: {age}\n")
```

## Appending to Files

If you want to add content to an existing file without overwriting it, use the append mode (`'a'`):

```python
# First, create or overwrite the file
with open("log.txt", "w") as file:
    file.write("Initial log entry\n")

# Later, append more content
with open("log.txt", "a") as file:
    file.write("Second log entry\n")
    file.write("Third log entry\n")
```

The output file `log.txt` will contain:
```
Initial log entry
Second log entry
Third log entry
```

## Writing Binary Data

For non-text files (like images, audio, or custom data formats), you should use binary mode by adding `'b'` to the file mode:

```python
# Writing binary data
data = bytes([65, 66, 67, 68, 69])  # ASCII values for ABCDE

with open("binary_file.bin", "wb") as file:
    file.write(data)
```

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: Creating a Simple Log File

```python
import datetime

def log_activity(message):
    with open("activity_log.txt", "a") as log_file:
        timestamp = datetime.datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")
        log_file.write(f"[{timestamp}] {message}\n")

# Usage:
log_activity("Application started")
log_activity("User logged in: john_doe")
log_activity("Database connection established")
log_activity("User logged out: john_doe")
log_activity("Application terminated")
```

The resulting `activity_log.txt` might look like:
```
[2023-07-20 14:32:45] Application started
[2023-07-20 14:32:46] User logged in: john_doe
[2023-07-20 14:32:47] Database connection established
[2023-07-20 14:33:15] User logged out: john_doe
[2023-07-20 14:33:16] Application terminated
```

### Example 2: Saving User Input to a File

```python
def get_user_details():
    name = input("Enter your name: ")
    age = input("Enter your age: ")
    country = input("Enter your country: ")
    
    with open("user_data.txt", "a") as user_file:
        user_file.write(f"Name: {name}, Age: {age}, Country: {country}\n")
    
    print("Information saved successfully!")

# Run the function to collect and save user data
get_user_details()
```

Sample input/output:
```
Enter your name: Maria Garcia
Enter your age: 28
Enter your country: Spain
Information saved successfully!
```

The content would be appended to `user_data.txt`:
```
Name: Maria Garcia, Age: 28, Country: Spain
```

### Example 3: Creating a CSV File

```python
def create_csv_report(data):
    with open("sales_report.csv", "w") as csv_file:
        # Write header
        csv_file.write("Product,Quantity,Price,Total\n")
        
        # Write data rows
        for product, quantity, price in data:
            total = quantity * price
            csv_file.write(f"{product},{quantity},{price:.2f},{total:.2f}\n")

# Sample data: (product, quantity, price)
sales_data = [
    ("Laptop", 5, 1200.00),
    ("Mouse", 10, 25.50),
    ("Keyboard", 7, 45.99),
    ("Monitor", 3, 199.99)
]

create_csv_report(sales_data)
```

The generated `sales_report.csv` would contain:
```
Product,Quantity,Price,Total
Laptop,5,1200.00,6000.00
Mouse,10,25.50,255.00
Keyboard,7,45.99,321.93
Monitor,3,199.99,599.97
```

## Best Practices and Common Pitfalls

### Always Close Your Files

While the `with` statement automatically closes files, if you're using the traditional `open()` approach, don't forget to close your files:

```python
file = open("important.txt", "w")
try:
    file.write("Critical data")
finally:
    file.close()  # Always executed, even if an error occurs
```

### Handle Exceptions

File operations can fail for various reasons (disk full, permission denied, etc.). Always implement proper error handling:

```python
try:
    with open("config.txt", "w") as file:
        file.write("settings = default\n")
        file.write("debug = False\n")
except IOError as e:
    print(f"Error writing to file: {e}")
```

### Use Proper File Paths

Be mindful of file paths, especially when your script might run from different directories:

```python
import os

# Create a file in the same directory as the script
script_dir = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))
file_path = os.path.join(script_dir, "output.txt")

with open(file_path, "w") as file:
    file.write("This file is in the same directory as the script")
```

## Summary

In this tutorial, we've covered how to:
- Open files in different write modes (`w`, `a`, `x`)
- Write text and binary data to files
- Use the `with` statement for safer file handling
- Handle exceptions when writing to files
- Create practical applications like logs and reports

File writing is an essential skill that allows your Python programs to persist data beyond program execution. By mastering these techniques, you'll be able to create applications that can store configurations, save user data, generate reports, and much more.

## Exercises

To practice your file writing skills, try these exercises:

1. Create a simple text editor program that can create new files and append text to them based on user input
2. Write a program that generates a daily report file with the current date in its filename
3. Create a logging decorator that can be applied to functions to log their execution to a file
4. Write a program that reads a CSV file, performs calculations on the data, and writes the results to a new file
5. Implement a simple key-value store that saves data to a file in a format of your choice
