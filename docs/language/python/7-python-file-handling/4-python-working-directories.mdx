# Python Working Directories

When working with files in Python, understanding how to manage and navigate directories is essential. This guide will walk you through working with directories in Python applications, covering everything from basic concepts to practical examples.

## Introduction to Working Directories

A **working directory** (or current directory) is the folder where your Python script is currently operating. When you use relative file paths (paths that don't start from the root of your file system), Python looks for those files relative to this working directory.

Understanding working directories is crucial because:

- File operations depend on the current working directory
- Paths can behave differently based on where your script is executed from
- Proper directory management makes your code more portable

## The `os` Module: Your Directory Management Tool

Python's built-in `os` module provides functions for interacting with the operating system, including directory operations. Let's explore the key functions:

### Getting the Current Working Directory

To find out which directory your Python script is currently working in:

```python
import os

# Get the current working directory
current_dir = os.getcwd()
print(f"Current working directory: {current_dir}")
```

**Output:**
```
Current working directory: C:\Users\username\projects\python_project
```

### Changing the Working Directory

You can change the working directory during script execution:

```python
import os

# Print the current directory
print(f"Starting directory: {os.getcwd()}")

# Change the working directory
os.chdir('../')  # Move up one directory

# Print the new current directory
print(f"New working directory: {os.getcwd()}")
```

**Output:**
```
Starting directory: C:\Users\username\projects\python_project
New working directory: C:\Users\username\projects
```

## Understanding File Paths

### Absolute vs. Relative Paths

1. **Absolute paths** start from the root directory of your file system:
   - Windows: `C:\folder\subfolder\file.txt`
   - Mac/Linux: `/home/user/folder/file.txt`

2. **Relative paths** are relative to the current working directory:
   - `data/file.txt` (a subfolder named "data" in the current directory)
   - `../data/file.txt` (a "data" folder in the parent directory)

### Creating Path Strings Correctly

The `os.path` module helps create proper file paths that work across different operating systems:

```python
import os

# Join path components (works on all operating systems)
data_folder = "data"
filename = "example.txt"

# Create a path
file_path = os.path.join(data_folder, filename)
print(f"Generated file path: {file_path}")

# Get the absolute path
abs_path = os.path.abspath(file_path)
print(f"Absolute path: {abs_path}")
```

**Output:**
```
Generated file path: data/example.txt
Absolute path: C:\Users\username\projects\python_project\data\example.txt
```

## Creating and Managing Directories

### Checking if a Directory Exists

Before working with a directory, you often need to check if it exists:

```python
import os

directory = "data"

if os.path.exists(directory) and os.path.isdir(directory):
    print(f"The directory '{directory}' exists")
else:
    print(f"The directory '{directory}' does not exist")
```

### Creating New Directories

You can create directories using `os.mkdir()` (for single directories) or `os.makedirs()` (for nested directories):

```python
import os

# Create a single directory
try:
    os.mkdir("new_folder")
    print("Directory 'new_folder' created")
except FileExistsError:
    print("Directory already exists")

# Create nested directories (creates parent directories if needed)
try:
    os.makedirs("parent_folder/child_folder/grandchild_folder")
    print("Nested directories created")
except FileExistsError:
    print("Directory path already exists")
```

### Listing Directory Contents

To see what's in a directory:

```python
import os

# List files and directories in the current directory
contents = os.listdir(".")
print("Directory contents:")
for item in contents:
    if os.path.isdir(item):
        print(f"📁 {item} (directory)")
    else:
        print(f"📄 {item} (file)")
```

## Real-World Application: Project File Organization

Let's build a script that creates a standard project structure for a new Python project:

```python
import os
import sys

def create_project_structure(project_name):
    """Create a standard Python project structure."""
    # Main project directory
    try:
        os.makedirs(project_name)
        print(f"Created project directory: {project_name}")
    except FileExistsError:
        print(f"WARNING: Project directory '{project_name}' already exists")
        return False
        
    # Create subdirectories
    directories = [
        f"{project_name}/src",
        f"{project_name}/tests",
        f"{project_name}/docs",
        f"{project_name}/data",
    ]
    
    for directory in directories:
        os.makedirs(directory)
        print(f"Created directory: {directory}")
    
    # Create basic files
    files = [
        (f"{project_name}/README.md", "# {}\n\nProject description goes here.".format(project_name)),
        (f"{project_name}/requirements.txt", "# Dependencies\npython>=3.6\n"),
        (f"{project_name}/src/__init__.py", ""),
        (f"{project_name}/tests/__init__.py", ""),
    ]
    
    for file_path, content in files:
        with open(file_path, 'w') as f:
            f.write(content)
        print(f"Created file: {file_path}")
    
    return True

if __name__ == "__main__":
    if len(sys.argv) != 2:
        print("Usage: python create_project.py <project_name>")
    else:
        project_name = sys.argv[1]
        create_project_structure(project_name)
        print(f"\nProject '{project_name}' initialized successfully!")
        print(f"Project location: {os.path.abspath(project_name)}")
```

You can run this script with:
```
python create_project.py my_new_project
```

This will create a standard project structure with source, test, documentation, and data directories, plus some starter files.

## Working with Temporary Directories

Sometimes you need temporary directories for your application. Python's `tempfile` module helps with this:

```python
import tempfile
import os

# Create a temporary directory
with tempfile.TemporaryDirectory() as temp_dir:
    print(f"Created temporary directory: {temp_dir}")
    
    # Create a file in the temporary directory
    temp_file_path = os.path.join(temp_dir, "temp_file.txt")
    with open(temp_file_path, "w") as f:
        f.write("This is temporary data")
    
    print(f"Wrote to temporary file: {temp_file_path}")
    
    # The directory and its contents will be automatically deleted
    # when the context manager exits
print("Temporary directory has been cleaned up")
```

## Best Practices for Working with Directories

1. **Use `os.path.join()` to create paths** instead of concatenating strings
2. **Always check if directories exist** before trying to access or modify them
3. **Handle exceptions** when performing directory operations
4. **Use absolute paths** when you need certainty about file locations
5. **Consider using `pathlib`** for more modern path handling (available in Python 3.4+)

### The Modern Alternative: `pathlib`

Python 3.4+ includes the `pathlib` module, which provides an object-oriented approach to file system paths:

```python
from pathlib import Path

# Get the current directory
current_dir = Path.cwd()
print(f"Current directory: {current_dir}")

# Create paths
data_dir = current_dir / "data"
file_path = data_dir / "example.txt"

print(f"Data directory path: {data_dir}")
print(f"File path: {file_path}")

# Create directory if it doesn't exist
data_dir.mkdir(exist_ok=True)

# Write to file
with open(file_path, 'w') as f:
    f.write("Hello from pathlib!")

# Check if path exists
if file_path.exists():
    print(f"File created successfully at: {file_path}")
```

## Summary

Working with directories in Python is straightforward once you understand the basic concepts:

- The working directory is where Python looks for files by default
- The `os` module provides functions for directory operations
- `os.path` helps you work with file paths in a platform-independent way
- You can create, navigate, and manage directories programmatically
- For newer Python versions, consider using `pathlib` for more elegant path handling

Understanding directory operations is essential for file I/O, data processing, and creating well-organized Python applications.

## Exercises

1. Write a script that lists all Python files (`.py` extension) in a directory and its subdirectories.
2. Create a program that organizes files in a directory by moving them to subdirectories based on their file extensions (e.g., `.jpg` files go to an "images" folder).
3. Write a function that backs up a directory by copying its contents to a new directory with the current date in its name.
