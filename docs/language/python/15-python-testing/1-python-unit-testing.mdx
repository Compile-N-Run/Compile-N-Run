# Python Unit Testing

## Introduction

Unit testing is a software testing method where individual units or components of code are tested in isolation. In Python, a "unit" typically refers to a function, method, or class. The main goal of unit testing is to verify that each part of your code works as expected, making it easier to identify and fix bugs early in the development process.

Why is unit testing important?

- **Early bug detection**: Catch bugs before they make it to production
- **Simplified debugging**: When tests fail, you know exactly where to look
- **Confidence in your code**: Well-tested code is more reliable
- **Documentation**: Tests demonstrate how your code is intended to work
- **Easier refactoring**: Tests ensure your changes don't break existing functionality

In this guide, we'll explore how to write effective unit tests in Python using both the built-in `unittest` framework and the popular third-party library `pytest`.

## Python's Built-in unittest Framework

Python comes with a built-in unit testing framework called `unittest`, inspired by Java's JUnit. Let's start by writing some simple tests.

### Basic Example

Let's say we have a simple function that adds two numbers:

```python
# math_operations.py
def add(a, b):
    return a + b
```

Now, let's write a test for this function:

```python
# test_math_operations.py
import unittest
from math_operations import add

class TestMathOperations(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_add(self):
        self.assertEqual(add(1, 2), 3)
        self.assertEqual(add(-1, 1), 0)
        self.assertEqual(add(-1, -1), -2)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

To run this test, you would execute:

```bash
python test_math_operations.py
```

Output:
```
.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ran 1 test in 0.001s

OK
```

The dot `.` indicates that the test passed. If a test fails, you'll see an `F` instead and an explanation of what went wrong.

### Understanding unittest Components

1. **TestCase**: The base class for all test cases
2. **Assertions**: Methods to check if the results are as expected
3. **Test Discovery**: The process of finding and running tests
4. **Test Fixtures**: Setup and teardown methods for preparing test environments

### Common Assertions in unittest

Here are some of the most commonly used assertions:

```python
# Various assertion types
def test_assertions_demo(self):
    # Test equality
    self.assertEqual(5, 5)
    
    # Test inequality
    self.assertNotEqual(5, 6)
    
    # Test boolean values
    self.assertTrue(True)
    self.assertFalse(False)
    
    # Test if an object is None
    self.assertIsNone(None)
    
    # Test if an object is not None
    x = 5
    self.assertIsNotNone(x)
    
    # Test if an item is in a container
    self.assertIn(2, [1, 2, 3])
    
    # Test if an item is not in a container
    self.assertNotIn(4, [1, 2, 3])
    
    # Test if values are approximately equal
    self.assertAlmostEqual(0.1 + 0.2, 0.3, places=7)
    
    # Test if code raises an exception
    with self.assertRaises(ZeroDivisionError):
        1 / 0
```

### Test Fixtures

Test fixtures are used to set up a consistent test environment. In `unittest`, you can use `setUp()` and `tearDown()` methods:

```python
import unittest
import tempfile
import os

class TestFileOperations(unittest.TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        # Create a temporary file before each test
        self.temp_file = tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(delete=False)
        self.temp_filename = self.temp_file.name
        self.temp_file.write(b"Hello, world!")
        self.temp_file.close()
        
    def tearDown(self):
        # Remove the temporary file after each test
        os.unlink(self.temp_filename)
        
    def test_read_file(self):
        with open(self.temp_filename, 'r') as f:
            content = f.read()
        self.assertEqual(content, "Hello, world!")
```

## Introduction to pytest

While `unittest` is powerful, `pytest` has become increasingly popular due to its simplicity and powerful features. Let's see how to use `pytest` for unit testing.

First, install pytest:

```bash
pip install pytest
```

### Basic pytest Example

Let's rewrite our addition function test using pytest:

```python
# test_math_operations_pytest.py
from math_operations import add

def test_add():
    assert add(1, 2) == 3
    assert add(-1, 1) == 0
    assert add(-1, -1) == -2
```

To run this test:

```bash
pytest test_math_operations_pytest.py
```

Output:
```
collected 1 item                                                                                                                                                           

test_math_operations_pytest.py .                                                                                                                                     [100%]

### pytest Features

1. **Simple Assertion Syntax**: Just use Python's `assert` statement
2. **Automatic Test Discovery**: pytest automatically finds test files and functions
3. **Detailed Failure Information**: Better output for test failures
4. **Fixtures**: More powerful and flexible than unittest fixtures
5. **Parameterized Testing**: Run the same test with different inputs
6. **Plugins Ecosystem**: Extend pytest functionality with plugins

### Fixtures in pytest

Fixtures in pytest are more flexible than in unittest:

```python
import pytest
import tempfile
import os

@pytest.fixture
def temp_file():
    # Setup
    temp = tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(delete=False)
    temp.write(b"Hello, world!")
    temp.close()
    
    # Provide the fixture value
    yield temp.name
    
    # Teardown
    os.unlink(temp.name)

def test_read_file(temp_file):
    with open(temp_file, 'r') as f:
        content = f.read()
    assert content == "Hello, world!"
```

### Parameterized Testing

One of pytest's most powerful features is parameterized testing, which allows you to run the same test with different inputs:

```python
import pytest
from math_operations import add

@pytest.mark.parametrize("a, b, expected", [
    (1, 2, 3),
    (-1, 1, 0),
    (-1, -1, -2),
    (0, 0, 0),
])
def test_add_parameterized(a, b, expected):
    assert add(a, b) == expected
```

## Real-World Unit Testing Example

Let's create a more comprehensive example with a `BankAccount` class:

```python
# bank_account.py
class InsufficientFundsError(Exception):
    pass

class BankAccount:
    def __init__(self, account_number, holder_name, initial_balance=0):
        self.account_number = account_number
        self.holder_name = holder_name
        self._balance = initial_balance
        
    @property
    def balance(self):
        return self._balance
        
    def deposit(self, amount):
        if amount <= 0:
            raise ValueError("Deposit amount must be positive")
        self._balance += amount
        return self._balance
        
    def withdraw(self, amount):
        if amount <= 0:
            raise ValueError("Withdrawal amount must be positive")
        if amount > self._balance:
            raise InsufficientFundsError("Insufficient funds for withdrawal")
        self._balance -= amount
        return self._balance
```

Now, let's write comprehensive tests for this class using pytest:

```python
# test_bank_account.py
import pytest
from bank_account import BankAccount, InsufficientFundsError

@pytest.fixture
def account():
    return BankAccount("123456", "John Doe", 1000)

def test_initialization():
    # Test default initialization
    account = BankAccount("123456", "John Doe")
    assert account.account_number == "123456"
    assert account.holder_name == "John Doe"
    assert account.balance == 0
    
    # Test initialization with initial balance
    account = BankAccount("123456", "John Doe", 1000)
    assert account.balance == 1000

def test_deposit(account):
    # Test successful deposit
    new_balance = account.deposit(500)
    assert new_balance == 1500
    assert account.balance == 1500
    
    # Test deposit validation
    with pytest.raises(ValueError):
        account.deposit(0)
    
    with pytest.raises(ValueError):
        account.deposit(-100)

def test_withdraw(account):
    # Test successful withdrawal
    new_balance = account.withdraw(500)
    assert new_balance == 500
    assert account.balance == 500
    
    # Test insufficient funds
    with pytest.raises(InsufficientFundsError):
        account.withdraw(1000)
    
    # Test withdrawal validation
    with pytest.raises(ValueError):
        account.withdraw(0)
    
    with pytest.raises(ValueError):
        account.withdraw(-100)
```

## Test Coverage

To ensure your tests are thoroughly checking your code, you can use coverage tools like `coverage.py`.

First, install it:

```bash
pip install pytest-cov
```

Then run your tests with coverage analysis:

```bash
pytest --cov=bank_account test_bank_account.py
```

Output:
```
collected 3 items                                                                                                                                                          

test_bank_account.py ...                                                                                                                                             [100%]

---------- coverage: platform linux, python 3.8.10-final-0 -----------
Name             Stmts   Miss  Cover
------------------------------------
bank_account.py     19      0   100%
------------------------------------
TOTAL               19      0   100%
```

This shows that our tests cover 100% of the code in `bank_account.py`.

## Testing Best Practices

1. **Write tests before code (TDD)**: This ensures your code is testable and meets requirements
2. **Test one thing per test**: Each test should verify a single functionality
3. **Keep tests simple**: Tests should be easy to understand and maintain
4. **Use clear naming**: Name your tests descriptively to understand what they're testing
5. **Aim for independence**: Tests shouldn't depend on each other
6. **Use fixtures for common setup**: Don't repeat setup code in every test
7. **Mock external dependencies**: Tests shouldn't rely on external services
8. **Run tests frequently**: Ideally with each code change
9. **Strive for high coverage**: Aim to test all code paths, but focus on logic complexity

## Mocking in Unit Tests

Mocking is the process of creating fake objects that simulate the behavior of real objects. This is useful when testing code that interacts with external systems like databases, APIs, or file systems.

Python has a built-in `unittest.mock` library:

```python
import unittest
from unittest.mock import patch
import requests
from my_app import fetch_user_data

class TestFetchUserData(unittest.TestCase):
    @patch('my_app.requests.get')
    def test_fetch_user_data(self, mock_get):
        # Setup the mock
        mock_response = unittest.mock.Mock()
        mock_response.status_code = 200
        mock_response.json.return_value = {'id': 1, 'name': 'John Doe'}
        mock_get.return_value = mock_response
        
        # Call the function that uses requests.get
        result = fetch_user_data(1)
        
        # Verify the function made the right requests
        mock_get.assert_called_once_with('https://api.example.com/users/1')
        
        # Verify the function processed the data correctly
        self.assertEqual(result, {'id': 1, 'name': 'John Doe'})
```

## Summary

Unit testing is a critical part of the software development process. In Python, you can use the built-in `unittest` framework or the more flexible `pytest` library to write and run tests. By following best practices and maintaining good test coverage, you can ensure your code works correctly and remains maintainable as your project grows.

Key takeaways:
- Unit tests validate individual components of your code
- Python offers both built-in `unittest` and third-party `pytest` frameworks
- Good tests are independent, focused, and maintainable
- Fixtures help set up consistent test environments
- Mocking helps isolate code from external dependencies
- Test coverage tools help ensure comprehensive testing
