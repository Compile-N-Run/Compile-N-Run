# Python Debugging

## Introduction

Debugging is an essential skill for any programmer. It's the process of finding and resolving bugs (errors or problems that prevent correct operation) within computer programs. In Python development, effective debugging can save you hours of frustration and help you build more reliable applications.

In this guide, we'll explore various debugging techniques in Python, from simple print statements to using integrated debugging tools. Whether you're troubleshooting a small script or a complex application, these skills will help you identify and fix issues efficiently.

## Understanding Errors in Python

Before diving into debugging techniques, let's understand the common types of errors you might encounter in Python:

### 1. Syntax Errors

These occur when the Python parser is unable to understand your code due to incorrect syntax.

```python
# Syntax error example
if True
    print("This will cause an error")
```

Output:
```
  File "<stdin>", line 1
    if True
          ^
SyntaxError: expected ':'
```

### 2. Runtime Errors (Exceptions)

These occur during program execution. Python provides many built-in exceptions like `TypeError`, `ValueError`, `IndexError`, etc.

```python
# Runtime error example
numbers = [1, 2, 3]
print(numbers[5])  # Trying to access index that doesn't exist
```

Output:
```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
IndexError: list index out of range
```

### 3. Logical Errors

These are the trickiest bugs, where code runs without raising exceptions but produces incorrect results due to flawed logic.

```python
# Logical error example
def calculate_average(numbers):
    total = 0
    for num in numbers:
        total += num
    return total  # Forgot to divide by length
    
print(calculate_average([10, 20, 30]))  # Returns 60 instead of 20
```

## Basic Debugging Techniques

### Print Statements

The simplest debugging technique is to use `print()` statements to inspect values at different points in your code.

```python
def complex_calculation(a, b, c):
    print(f"Inputs: a={a}, b={b}, c={c}")
    
    intermediate = a * b
    print(f"Intermediate result: {intermediate}")
    
    final_result = intermediate / c
    print(f"Final result: {final_result}")
    
    return final_result

result = complex_calculation(10, 5, 2)
print(f"Function returned: {result}")
```

Output:
```
Inputs: a=10, b=5, c=2
Intermediate result: 50
Final result: 25.0
Function returned: 25.0
```

### Using assert Statements

The `assert` statement is useful for checking assumptions during development.

```python
def get_positive_number(num):
    assert num > 0, f"Expected positive number, got {num}"
    return num

# This will work
try:
    print(get_positive_number(5))
except AssertionError as e:
    print(e)

# This will raise an AssertionError
try:
    print(get_positive_number(-5))
except AssertionError as e:
    print(e)
```

Output:
```
5
Expected positive number, got -5
```

### Logging

For more advanced applications, using the `logging` module is better than `print()` statements:

```python
import logging

# Configure logging
logging.basicConfig(
    level=logging.DEBUG,
    format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s'
)

def divide_numbers(a, b):
    logging.debug(f"Dividing {a} by {b}")
    if b == 0:
        logging.error("Division by zero!")
        return None
    result = a / b
    logging.info(f"Result: {result}")
    return result

divide_numbers(10, 2)
divide_numbers(10, 0)
```

Output:
```
2023-11-10 15:30:45,123 - DEBUG - Dividing 10 by 2
2023-11-10 15:30:45,124 - INFO - Result: 5.0
2023-11-10 15:30:45,125 - DEBUG - Dividing 10 by 0
2023-11-10 15:30:45,126 - ERROR - Division by zero!
```

## Python's Built-in Debugger: pdb

Python includes a built-in debugger module called `pdb` that allows you to set breakpoints, step through code, and inspect variables.

### Basic pdb Usage

```python
import pdb

def factorial(n):
    if n <= 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n-1)

n = 5
pdb.set_trace()  # Set a breakpoint
result = factorial(n)
print(f"The factorial of {n} is {result}")
```

When you run this code, it will pause at the breakpoint, and you'll enter the interactive debugger. Here are some common pdb commands:

- `n` (next): Execute the current line and move to the next line
- `s` (step): Step into a function call
- `c` (continue): Continue execution until the next breakpoint
- `p expression`: Print the value of an expression
- `q` (quit): Quit the debugger

### Using Breakpoint() Function

In Python 3.7+, you can use the simpler `breakpoint()` function:

```python
def analyze_data(data):
    total = sum(data)
    average = total / len(data)
    breakpoint()  # Equivalent to pdb.set_trace()
    return {
        'total': total,
        'average': average,
        'max': max(data),
        'min': min(data)
    }

sample_data = [12, 5, 8, 15, 10]
results = analyze_data(sample_data)
print(results)
```

## Debugging with IDEs

Modern IDEs provide powerful graphical debugging interfaces that make the process much easier.

### Visual Studio Code

VS Code with the Python extension offers:
- Breakpoints that can be set with a click
- Variable inspection
- Call stack viewing
- Watch expressions

Here's how to set up a basic debug configuration in VS Code:

1. Create a `.vscode/launch.json` file:
```json
{
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
        {
            "name": "Python: Current File",
            "type": "python",
            "request": "launch",
            "program": "${file}",
            "console": "integratedTerminal"
        }
    ]
}
```

2. Set breakpoints by clicking in the gutter next to line numbers
3. Start debugging using F5 or the Debug menu

### PyCharm

PyCharm provides similar features with an even more comprehensive debugging experience:
- Conditional breakpoints
- Evaluate expressions
- Change variable values during debugging

## Advanced Debugging Techniques

### Using try-except for Debugging

You can use exception handling to identify where errors occur:

```python
def risky_operation(data):
    try:
        result = process_data(data)
        return result
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error occurred: {e}")
        print(f"Error type: {type(e).__name__}")
        import traceback
        traceback.print_exc()
        return None
        
def process_data(data):
    # This will raise a TypeError if data isn't a list
    return [item * 2 for item in data]

# This will work
print(risky_operation([1, 2, 3]))

# This will catch and report the error
print(risky_operation(10))
```

### Post-mortem Debugging

When your program crashes with an exception, you can analyze the state at the time of the crash:

```python
import pdb

def faulty_function():
    x = 10
    y = 0
    return x / y  # Will raise ZeroDivisionError

try:
    faulty_function()
except:
    pdb.post_mortem()
```

This will launch the debugger at the point where the exception occurred.

### Using Decorators for Debugging

Creating debugging decorators can help trace function calls:

```python
def debug_decorator(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        args_repr = [repr(a) for a in args]
        kwargs_repr = [f"{k}={v!r}" for k, v in kwargs.items()]
        signature = ", ".join(args_repr + kwargs_repr)
        print(f"Calling {func.__name__}({signature})")
        
        try:
            result = func(*args, **kwargs)
            print(f"{func.__name__} returned {result!r}")
            return result
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"{func.__name__} raised {type(e).__name__}: {e}")
            raise
            
    return wrapper

@debug_decorator
def divide(a, b):
    return a / b

print(divide(10, 5))
try:
    print(divide(10, 0))
except:
    pass
```

Output:
```
Calling divide(10, 5)
divide returned 2.0
2.0
Calling divide(10, 0)
divide raised ZeroDivisionError: division by zero
```

## Real-world Debugging Example

Let's explore a more complex example to demonstrate debugging a real application. We'll create a simple Flask API with a bug, then debug it.

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

# Database simulation
users = {
    1: {"name": "John", "email": "john@example.com"},
    2: {"name": "Sarah", "email": "sarah@example.com"}
}

@app.route("/user/<int:user_id>")
def get_user(user_id):
    # Bug: Not handling case when user doesn't exist
    return jsonify(users[user_id])

@app.route("/user", methods=["POST"])
def create_user():
    data = request.json
    
    # Debug print
    print(f"Received data: {data}")
    
    # Validation
    if "name" not in data or "email" not in data:
        return jsonify({"error": "Missing required fields"}), 400
        
    # Create new user
    user_id = max(users.keys()) + 1
    users[user_id] = {"name": data["name"], "email": data["email"]}
    
    # Debug assertion
    assert user_id in users, f"User {user_id} was not added properly"
    
    return jsonify({"id": user_id, "name": data["name"]}), 201

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True)  # Flask's debug mode
```

The bug in this application is that `/user/<user_id>` doesn't handle the case when a user doesn't exist. We can fix it:

```python
@app.route("/user/<int:user_id>")
def get_user(user_id):
    # Fixed: Handle case when user doesn't exist
    if user_id not in users:
        return jsonify({"error": "User not found"}), 404
    return jsonify(users[user_id])
```

This example demonstrates:
1. Using print statements for API debugging
2. Assertions to catch logical errors
3. Flask's debug mode for development
4. Error handling to prevent crashes

## Common Debugging Pitfalls and Tips

### Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Debugging without a plan**: Randomly changing code can create more bugs
2. **Ignoring error messages**: Python's error messages provide valuable clues
3. **Overcomplicating**: Start with the simplest explanation for a bug
4. **Not isolating the problem**: Create minimal test cases that reproduce the issue

### Best Practices

1. **Test incrementally**: Write small pieces of code and test frequently
2. **Use version control**: So you can revert to working states
3. **Comment your debugging code**: So you remember to remove it later
4. **Document bugs and fixes**: Create a knowledge base for future reference

## Practice Exercises

1. **Bug Hunt**: Take the following code with bugs and fix it:
   ```python
   def calculate_grades(scores):
       grades = []
       for score in scores:
           if score >= 90:
               grades.append("A")
           elif score >= 80:
               grades.append("B")
           elif score >= 70:
               grades.append("C")
           elif score >= 60:
               grades.append("D")
           else:
               grades.append("F")
       return grade  # Bug: undefined variable
   
   student_scores = [85, 92, 78, 65, 55]
   print(calculate_grades(student_scores))
   ```

2. **Debugging Practice**: Create a Flask application that reads data from a file. Introduce a bug (like using a non-existent file), then use debugging techniques to identify and fix the issue.

3. **Custom Debugger**: Create a custom debugging decorator that logs function execution time and parameters to a file.

Happy debugging!
