# Python Conditional Statements

## Introduction

Conditional statements are the decision-makers in programming. They allow your program to behave differently based on different conditions, essentially enabling your code to make decisions. In Python, these decisions are primarily implemented using `if`, `elif` (short for "else if"), and `else` statements.

Think of conditional statements as the crossroads in your code's journey. Based on certain conditions, your program will take different paths, executing specific blocks of code while skipping others.

## Basic Syntax of Conditional Statements

### The `if` Statement

The most fundamental conditional statement in Python is the `if` statement. It evaluates a condition and executes a block of code if that condition is `True`.

```python
if condition:
    # Code to execute if the condition is True
```

Here's a simple example:

```python
age = 18

if age >= 18:
    print("You are eligible to vote!")
```

Output:
```
You are eligible to vote!
```

In this example, the code checks if `age` is greater than or equal to 18. Since the condition is `True`, the print statement executes.

### The `else` Statement

The `else` statement provides an alternative block of code to execute when the `if` condition is `False`.

```python
if condition:
    # Code to execute if the condition is True
else:
    # Code to execute if the condition is False
```

Let's extend our voting example:

```python
age = 16

if age >= 18:
    print("You are eligible to vote!")
else:
    print("Sorry, you are not eligible to vote yet.")
```

Output:
```
Sorry, you are not eligible to vote yet.
```

### The `elif` Statement

Short for "else if," the `elif` statement allows you to check multiple conditions in sequence.

```python
if condition1:
    # Code to execute if condition1 is True
elif condition2:
    # Code to execute if condition1 is False and condition2 is True
else:
    # Code to execute if both condition1 and condition2 are False
```

Example with multiple conditions:

```python
score = 85

if score >= 90:
    print("Grade: A")
elif score >= 80:
    print("Grade: B")
elif score >= 70:
    print("Grade: C")
elif score >= 60:
    print("Grade: D")
else:
    print("Grade: F")
```

Output:
```
Grade: B
```

## Nested Conditional Statements

You can place conditional statements inside other conditional statements, creating nested conditions.

```python
temperature = 25
humidity = 80

if temperature > 30:
    print("It's hot outside!")
    if humidity > 60:
        print("And it's humid too!")
else:
    print("Temperature is moderate.")
    if humidity > 60:
        print("But it's quite humid.")
```

Output:
```
Temperature is moderate.
But it's quite humid.
```

## Logical Operators with Conditionals

Python provides logical operators to combine multiple conditions:

- `and`: Both conditions must be `True`
- `or`: At least one condition must be `True`
- `not`: Inverts the condition (makes `True` into `False` and vice versa)

```python
username = "admin"
password = "12345"

if username == "admin" and password == "12345":
    print("Login successful")
else:
    print("Invalid credentials")
```

Output:
```
Login successful
```

Using `or`:

```python
day = "Saturday"

if day == "Saturday" or day == "Sunday":
    print("It's the weekend!")
else:
    print("It's a weekday.")
```

Output:
```
It's the weekend!
```

Using `not`:

```python
is_raining = False

if not is_raining:
    print("No need for an umbrella!")
else:
    print("Take an umbrella!")
```

Output:
```
No need for an umbrella!
```

## Conditional Expressions (Ternary Operator)

Python offers a shorthand way to write simple conditional statements using the ternary operator:

```python
# Syntax: value_if_true if condition else value_if_false
```

Example:

```python
age = 20
status = "Adult" if age >= 18 else "Minor"
print(status)
```

Output:
```
Adult
```

This is equivalent to:

```python
age = 20
if age >= 18:
    status = "Adult"
else:
    status = "Minor"
print(status)
```

## Real-World Applications

### 1. Authentication System

```python
def authenticate_user():
    username = input("Enter username: ")
    password = input("Enter password: ")
    
    stored_username = "user123"
    stored_password = "pass456"
    
    if username == stored_username and password == stored_password:
        print("Authentication successful!")
        return True
    else:
        print("Invalid username or password!")
        return False

# Testing the function
authenticate_user()
```

If you enter "user123" as username and "pass456" as password, the output will be:
```
Authentication successful!
```

Otherwise:
```
Invalid username or password!
```

### 2. Temperature Converter with Validation

```python
def convert_temperature():
    temp_str = input("Enter temperature (e.g., '32F' or '0C'): ")
    
    if len(temp_str) < 2:
        print("Invalid format. Use format like '32F' or '0C'.")
        return
    
    try:
        temp = float(temp_str[:-1])
        unit = temp_str[-1].upper()
        
        if unit == 'C':
            result = (temp * 9/5) + 32
            print(f"{temp}°C is equal to {result:.1f}°F")
        elif unit == 'F':
            result = (temp - 32) * 5/9
            print(f"{temp}°F is equal to {result:.1f}°C")
        else:
            print("Invalid unit. Use 'C' for Celsius or 'F' for Fahrenheit.")
    except ValueError:
        print("Invalid temperature. Please enter a number followed by 'C' or 'F'.")

# Testing the function
convert_temperature()
```

If you enter "32F", the output will be:
```
32.0°F is equal to 0.0°C
```

### 3. Simple Menu System

```python
def display_menu():
    print("\n=== Main Menu ===")
    print("1. View Profile")
    print("2. Edit Settings")
    print("3. Help")
    print("4. Exit")
    
    choice = input("\nEnter your choice (1-4): ")
    
    if choice == '1':
        print("Viewing your profile...")
    elif choice == '2':
        print("Opening settings menu...")
    elif choice == '3':
        print("Displaying help documentation...")
    elif choice == '4':
        print("Exiting program. Goodbye!")
    else:
        print("Invalid choice. Please select a number between 1 and 4.")

# Testing the function
display_menu()
```

## Additional Techniques

### Using `in` with Conditionals

The `in` operator checks if a value exists in a sequence (like a list, tuple, or string):

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

if "banana" in fruits:
    print("Yes, banana is a fruit!")
```

Output:
```
Yes, banana is a fruit!
```

### Truth Value Testing

In Python, values are inherently considered `True` or `False` in a boolean context:

- Empty sequences (lists, tuples, strings, etc.) are considered `False`
- Zero in any numeric type is considered `False`
- `None` is considered `False`
- Everything else is generally considered `True`

```python
# Examples
if []:
    print("This won't print because an empty list is False")
    
if 0:
    print("This won't print because 0 is False")
    
if "Hello":
    print("This will print because a non-empty string is True")
```

Output:
```
This will print because a non-empty string is True
```

## Common Pitfalls and Best Practices

### 1. Using `==` vs. `is`

The `==` operator compares values, while `is` compares identities (if they're the same object):

```python
a = [1, 2, 3]
b = [1, 2, 3]

print(a == b)  # True - same values
print(a is b)  # False - different objects
```

Output:
```
True
False
```

### 2. Be Careful with Mutable Default Arguments

```python
# Problematic
def add_item(item, list=[]):
    list.append(item)
    return list

print(add_item("apple"))  # ['apple']
print(add_item("banana"))  # ['apple', 'banana'] (not what you might expect)

# Better approach
def add_item_better(item, list=None):
    if list is None:
        list = []
    list.append(item)
    return list

print(add_item_better("apple"))  # ['apple']
print(add_item_better("banana"))  # ['banana']
```

### 3. Using Multiple Conditions Efficiently

```python
# Less efficient (evaluates all conditions)
if x > 0 and x < 10 and x % 2 == 0:
    print("x is a positive even number less than 10")

# More efficient (short-circuit evaluation)
if 0 < x < 10 and x % 2 == 0:
    print("x is a positive even number less than 10")
```

## Summary

Conditional statements are fundamental building blocks in Python programming that allow your code to make decisions based on different conditions:

- **`if`** statements execute code when a condition is true
- **`elif`** statements provide additional conditions to check
- **`else`** statements provide a fallback when no conditions are met
- Logical operators (**`and`**, **`or`**, **`not`**) allow combining or inverting conditions
- The ternary operator provides a concise way to write simple conditional expressions

Mastering conditional statements is essential for writing dynamic and responsive programs that can adapt to different inputs and situations.
