# Python For Loop

## Introduction

Loops are fundamental programming constructs that allow us to execute a block of code multiple times. In Python, the `for` loop is one of the most commonly used loop structures. It provides an elegant way to iterate over sequences (such as lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets, or strings) and other iterable objects.

Unlike `for` loops in languages like C or Java that typically iterate over numeric ranges, Python's `for` loop is designed to work with the iterator protocol, making it more versatile and easier to use.

## Basic Syntax

The basic syntax of a Python `for` loop is:

```python
for element in iterable:
    # Code block to be executed for each element
```

Where:
- `element` is a variable that takes the value of the item inside the iterable for each iteration
- `iterable` is a collection of objects like lists, tuples, strings, etc.
- The indented code block is executed once for each item in the iterable

## Simple For Loop Examples

### Iterating Through a List

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
```

**Output:**
```
apple
banana
cherry
```

In this example, the variable `fruit` takes on each value in the `fruits` list, and the `print` statement is executed for each value.

### Iterating Through a String

Strings in Python are iterable sequences of characters:

```python
message = "Hello"
for character in message:
    print(character)
```

**Output:**
```
H
e
l
l
o
```

## The `range()` Function

The `range()` function generates a sequence of numbers, which is commonly used with `for` loops when you need to repeat an action a specific number of times.

### Basic Range

```python
for i in range(5):
    print(i)
```

**Output:**
```
0
1
2
3
4
```

Note that `range(5)` produces numbers from 0 to 4 (not including 5).

### Range with Start and Stop

```python
for i in range(2, 6):
    print(i)
```

**Output:**
```
2
3
4
5
```

### Range with Step

You can also specify a step value:

```python
for i in range(1, 10, 2):
    print(i)
```

**Output:**
```
1
3
5
7
9
```

## Nested For Loops

You can place a loop inside another loop to create nested loops:

```python
for i in range(1, 4):
    for j in range(1, 4):
        print(f"({i}, {j})", end=" ")
    print()  # Print a newline after each inner loop completes
```

**Output:**
```
(1, 1) (1, 2) (1, 3) 
(2, 1) (2, 2) (2, 3) 
(3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 3) 
```

## Loop Control Statements

### The `break` Statement

The `break` statement terminates the loop prematurely:

```python
for i in range(1, 10):
    if i == 5:
        break
    print(i, end=" ")
```

**Output:**
```
1 2 3 4 
```

### The `continue` Statement

The `continue` statement skips the current iteration and proceeds to the next one:

```python
for i in range(1, 6):
    if i == 3:
        continue
    print(i, end=" ")
```

**Output:**
```
1 2 4 5 
```

### The `else` Clause

Python allows an optional `else` clause with a `for` loop. The `else` block is executed when the loop completes normally (not terminated by a `break`):

```python
for i in range(1, 6):
    print(i, end=" ")
else:
    print("\nLoop completed successfully!")
```

**Output:**
```
1 2 3 4 5 
Loop completed successfully!
```

If the loop is exited with a `break`, the `else` block is not executed:

```python
for i in range(1, 6):
    if i == 3:
        break
    print(i, end=" ")
else:
    print("\nThis won't be printed!")
```

**Output:**
```
1 2 
```

## Advanced For Loop Techniques

### Using `enumerate()`

The `enumerate()` function adds a counter to an iterable:

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for index, fruit in enumerate(fruits):
    print(f"{index}: {fruit}")
```

**Output:**
```
0: apple
1: banana
2: cherry
```

### Using `zip()`

The `zip()` function allows you to iterate through multiple iterables in parallel:

```python
names = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"]
ages = [25, 30, 35]
for name, age in zip(names, ages):
    print(f"{name} is {age} years old")
```

**Output:**
```
Alice is 25 years old
Bob is 30 years old
Charlie is 35 years old
```

### List Comprehension

List comprehensions provide a concise way to create lists using a `for` loop in a single line:

```python
# Create a list of squares from 0 to 9
squares = [x**2 for x in range(10)]
print(squares)
```

**Output:**
```
[0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81]
```

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: Finding Prime Numbers

A function to check if a number is prime using a `for` loop:

```python
def is_prime(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    if n <= 3:
        return True
    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:
        return False
    
    i = 5
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        i += 6
    return True

# Print all prime numbers below 20
for num in range(1, 20):
    if is_prime(num):
        print(num, end=" ")
```

**Output:**
```
2 3 5 7 11 13 17 19 
```

### Example 2: File Processing

Using a `for` loop to read and process a file line by line:

```python
# Assuming you have a file named "sample.txt" with multiple lines
try:
    with open("sample.txt", "r") as file:
        line_number = 1
        for line in file:
            print(f"Line {line_number}: {line.strip()}")
            line_number += 1
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("The file doesn't exist.")
```

### Example 3: Dictionary Iteration

Iterating through a dictionary:

```python
student_scores = {
    "Alice": 85,
    "Bob": 92,
    "Charlie": 78,
    "David": 95
}

# Iterate through keys
for student in student_scores:
    print(student)

print("\n---\n")

# Iterate through key-value pairs
for student, score in student_scores.items():
    print(f"{student}'s score: {score}")

print("\n---\n")

# Iterate through values only
for score in student_scores.values():
    print(score)
```

**Output:**
```
Alice
Bob
Charlie
David

---

Alice's score: 85
Bob's score: 92
Charlie's score: 78
David's score: 95

---

85
92
78
95
```

## Summary

Python's `for` loop is a powerful and versatile tool for iteration that:

- Iterates over any iterable object (lists, tuples, strings, dictionaries, etc.)
- Can be used with the `range()` function to repeat code a specific number of times
- Can be controlled with `break`, `continue`, and `else` clauses
- Can be nested for more complex iterations
- Works well with helper functions like `enumerate()` and `zip()`

Understanding and mastering the `for` loop is essential for writing efficient Python code and solving a wide range of programming problems.
