# Python Break and Continue Statements

When working with loops in Python, there are situations where you might want to:
- Skip the current iteration and move to the next one
- Exit the loop completely before its normal completion

Python provides two special statements for these situations: `continue` and `break`. These statements give you more fine-grained control over your loops, making your code more efficient and expressive.

## The `break` Statement

The `break` statement allows you to exit a loop immediately, regardless of the loop condition.

### How `break` Works

When Python encounters a `break` statement:
1. It immediately terminates the loop containing it
2. Program control flows to the statement immediately after the loop
3. If the `break` is inside nested loops, it only exits from the innermost loop

### Basic Example of `break`

```python
for number in range(1, 10):
    if number == 5:
        print("Found 5! Breaking the loop...")
        break
    print(f"Current number: {number}")
    
print("Loop ended")
```

Output:
```
Current number: 1
Current number: 2
Current number: 3
Current number: 4
Found 5! Breaking the loop...
Loop ended
```

Notice how the loop exits as soon as `number` equals 5, and the program continues with the statements after the loop.

## The `continue` Statement

The `continue` statement skips the rest of the code inside the current loop iteration and jumps to the next iteration.

### How `continue` Works

When Python encounters a `continue` statement:
1. It skips the remaining code in the current loop iteration
2. Control returns to the top of the loop for the next iteration
3. The loop condition is re-evaluated as usual

### Basic Example of `continue`

```python
for number in range(1, 10):
    if number % 2 == 0:  # If number is even
        continue  # Skip the rest of the loop for even numbers
    print(f"Current number: {number}")
    
print("Loop ended")
```

Output:
```
Current number: 1
Current number: 3
Current number: 5
Current number: 7
Current number: 9
Loop ended
```

In this example, the `continue` statement skips printing even numbers, so only odd numbers are displayed.

## Practical Applications

### Example 1: Input Validation with `break`

Here's how you might use `break` to validate user input:

```python
while True:
    user_input = input("Enter a positive number (or 'q' to quit): ")
    
    if user_input.lower() == 'q':
        print("Exiting the program...")
        break
    
    try:
        number = float(user_input)
        if number <= 0:
            print("Please enter a POSITIVE number.")
        else:
            print(f"You entered: {number}")
    except ValueError:
        print("That's not a valid number. Try again.")

print("Program terminated.")
```

Sample Output:
```
Enter a positive number (or 'q' to quit): -5
Please enter a POSITIVE number.
Enter a positive number (or 'q' to quit): hello
That's not a valid number. Try again.
Enter a positive number (or 'q' to quit): 10.5
You entered: 10.5
Enter a positive number (or 'q' to quit): q
Exiting the program...
Program terminated.
```

### Example 2: Processing a List with `continue`

Here's how you might use `continue` to filter items while processing a list:

```python
def process_scores(scores):
    passing_scores = []
    
    for score in scores:
        # Skip invalid scores
        if score < 0 or score > 100:
            print(f"Invalid score detected: {score}. Skipping.")
            continue
            
        # Skip failing scores
        if score < 60:
            continue
            
        # Process passing scores
        passing_scores.append(score)
    
    if passing_scores:
        average = sum(passing_scores) / len(passing_scores)
        return f"Average of passing scores: {average:.2f}"
    else:
        return "No passing scores found."

# Test the function
test_scores = [75, 90, -5, 45, 110, 60, 82]
result = process_scores(test_scores)
print(result)
```

Output:
```
Invalid score detected: -5. Skipping.
Invalid score detected: 110. Skipping.
Average of passing scores: 76.75
```

## Using `break` and `continue` with `else` in Loops

Python has a unique feature where you can use an `else` clause with loops. The `else` block executes when the loop completes normally (without encountering a `break`).

```python
for number in range(2, 10):
    for x in range(2, number):
        if number % x == 0:
            print(f"{number} equals {x} * {number//x}")
            break
    else:
        # This runs if no break occurred (number is prime)
        print(f"{number} is a prime number")
```

Output:
```
2 is a prime number
3 is a prime number
4 equals 2 * 2
5 is a prime number
6 equals 2 * 3
7 is a prime number
8 equals 2 * 4
9 equals 3 * 3
```

## Common Pitfalls and Best Practices

### Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Infinite Loops**: Be careful when using `continue` in `while` loops. Ensure your loop condition eventually becomes `False`.

```python
# Problematic code - infinite loop!
counter = 0
while counter < 5:
    if counter < 3:
        continue  # Counter never increases if less than 3!
    counter += 1
```

2. **Missing Loop Termination**: Ensure loops with `break` will eventually terminate.

### Best Practices

1. **Use Comments**: Always document why you're using `break` or `continue`.

2. **Limit Usage**: Excessive use of `break` and `continue` can make code harder to read.

3. **Consider Alternatives**: Sometimes restructuring your loop logic is clearer than using `break` or `continue`.

```python
# Instead of:
for item in items:
    if not some_condition(item):
        continue
    # process item...

# Consider:
for item in items:
    if some_condition(item):
        # process item...
```

## Summary

- **`break`** immediately exits the loop entirely
- **`continue`** skips the current iteration and moves to the next one
- These statements help you control loop flow with greater precision
- When combined with conditions, they make your loops more efficient and expressive
- The loop's `else` clause executes only if the loop completes normally (without `break`)

## Practice Exercises

1. Write a program that asks the user for numbers until they enter 0, but skips negative numbers.

2. Create a program that looks for the first palindrome word in a list of words.

3. Implement a simple calculator that continues until the user enters "exit".

4. Write a program that generates random numbers until it gets a number divisible by both 3 and 5.
