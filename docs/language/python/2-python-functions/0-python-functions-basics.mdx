# Python Functions Basics

## Introduction

Functions are one of the most important building blocks in Python programming. They allow you to organize your code into reusable blocks, making your programs more modular, maintainable, and easier to understand. Think of functions as mini-programs within your main program that perform specific tasks.

In this tutorial, you'll learn:
- What functions are and why they're important
- How to define and call your own functions
- Working with parameters and return values
- Function scope basics

## What Are Functions?

A function is a block of organized, reusable code that performs a specific task. Instead of writing the same code multiple times, you can create a function once and call it whenever you need that functionality.

Python has many built-in functions that you've likely already used, such as `print()`, `len()`, and `input()`. These built-in functions make common tasks easier, but the real power comes when you create your own functions tailored to your specific needs.

## Defining a Function

The basic syntax for defining a function in Python uses the `def` keyword:

```python
def function_name(parameters):
    """Docstring explaining what the function does"""
    # Code block
    # More code
    return value  # Optional
```

Let's break down the components:

1. `def` keyword: Signals that you're defining a function
2. `function_name`: A descriptive name for your function (follow variable naming rules)
3. `parameters`: Optional inputs that the function can accept
4. `docstring`: A comment describing what the function does (good practice)
5. Code block: The indented statements that run when the function is called
6. `return`: Optional statement that exits the function and returns a value

## Your First Function

Let's create a simple function that greets a user:

```python
def greet():
    """Print a greeting message"""
    print("Hello! Welcome to Python functions.")
```

To use this function, you need to call it:

```python
greet()  # Call the function
```

Output:
```
Hello! Welcome to Python functions.
```

This simple example demonstrates the basic structure, but functions become much more powerful when we add parameters and return values.

## Function Parameters

Parameters allow you to pass information to functions. They act as variables inside the function:

```python
def greet_person(name):
    """Greet a specific person"""
    print(f"Hello, {name}! Nice to meet you.")

# Call the function with an argument
greet_person("Alex")
greet_person("Taylor")
```

Output:
```
Hello, Alex! Nice to meet you.
Hello, Taylor! Nice to meet you.
```

You can define multiple parameters by separating them with commas:

```python
def describe_pet(animal_type, pet_name):
    """Display information about a pet"""
    print(f"I have a {animal_type} named {pet_name}.")

describe_pet("dog", "Rex")
describe_pet("cat", "Whiskers")
```

Output:
```
I have a dog named Rex.
I have a cat named Whiskers.
```

### Default Parameter Values

You can set default values for parameters, which are used when no argument is provided:

```python
def greet_with_message(name, message="Good day"):
    """Greet a person with a custom or default message"""
    print(f"{message}, {name}!")

greet_with_message("Jamie")  # Uses default message
greet_with_message("Casey", "Welcome back")  # Uses custom message
```

Output:
```
Good day, Jamie!
Welcome back, Casey!
```

## Return Values

Functions can send back results using the `return` statement:

```python
def add_numbers(a, b):
    """Add two numbers and return the result"""
    sum_result = a + b
    return sum_result

# Store the returned value in a variable
result = add_numbers(5, 3)
print(f"The sum is: {result}")

# Use the returned value directly in an expression
print(f"Double the sum: {add_numbers(5, 3) * 2}")
```

Output:
```
The sum is: 8
Double the sum: 16
```

A function stops executing when it reaches a `return` statement. You can have multiple `return` statements in a function, but only one will execute based on conditions:

```python
def get_absolute(number):
    """Return the absolute value of a number"""
    if number >= 0:
        return number
    else:
        return -number

print(get_absolute(5))
print(get_absolute(-7))
```

Output:
```
5
7
```

## Function Scope

Variables defined inside a function have a local scope, meaning they can only be accessed within that function:

```python
def calculate_area():
    """Calculate the area of a rectangle"""
    length = 10
    width = 5
    area = length * width
    print(f"Area inside function: {area}")

calculate_area()

# This would cause an error as 'area' is not defined outside the function
# print(f"Area outside function: {area}")
```

Output:
```
Area inside function: 50
```

Variables defined outside any function have a global scope and can be accessed inside functions:

```python
message = "Hello, world!"

def display_message():
    """Display the global message"""
    print(message)

display_message()
```

Output:
```
Hello, world!
```

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: Temperature Converter

```python
def celsius_to_fahrenheit(celsius):
    """Convert Celsius to Fahrenheit"""
    fahrenheit = (celsius * 9/5) + 32
    return fahrenheit

def fahrenheit_to_celsius(fahrenheit):
    """Convert Fahrenheit to Celsius"""
    celsius = (fahrenheit - 32) * 5/9
    return celsius

# Test the functions
temp_c = 25
temp_f = celsius_to_fahrenheit(temp_c)
print(f"{temp_c}°C is equal to {temp_f:.1f}°F")

temp_f = 98.6
temp_c = fahrenheit_to_celsius(temp_f)
print(f"{temp_f}°F is equal to {temp_c:.1f}°C")
```

Output:
```
25°C is equal to 77.0°F
98.6°F is equal to 37.0°C
```

### Example 2: Simple Calculator

```python
def calculator(num1, num2, operation):
    """Perform basic arithmetic operations"""
    if operation == "add":
        return num1 + num2
    elif operation == "subtract":
        return num1 - num2
    elif operation == "multiply":
        return num1 * num2
    elif operation == "divide":
        if num2 != 0:  # Avoid division by zero
            return num1 / num2
        else:
            return "Error: Division by zero"
    else:
        return "Error: Unknown operation"

# Test the calculator
print(calculator(10, 5, "add"))      # Addition
print(calculator(10, 5, "subtract")) # Subtraction
print(calculator(10, 5, "multiply")) # Multiplication
print(calculator(10, 5, "divide"))   # Division
print(calculator(10, 0, "divide"))   # Division by zero
```

Output:
```
15
5
50
2.0
Error: Division by zero
```

### Example 3: Password Validator

```python
def is_valid_password(password):
    """
    Check if a password meets security criteria:
    - At least 8 characters long
    - Contains at least one digit
    - Contains at least one uppercase letter
    """
    if len(password) < 8:
        return False
    
    has_digit = False
    has_uppercase = False
    
    for char in password:
        if char.isdigit():
            has_digit = True
        if char.isupper():
            has_uppercase = True
    
    return has_digit and has_uppercase

# Test passwords
passwords = ["abc123", "Password123", "hello", "SECUREPASS", "Secure123"]

for pwd in passwords:
    if is_valid_password(pwd):
        print(f"'{pwd}' is a valid password")
    else:
        print(f"'{pwd}' is NOT a valid password")
```

Output:
```
'abc123' is NOT a valid password
'Password123' is a valid password
'hello' is NOT a valid password
'SECUREPASS' is NOT a valid password
'Secure123' is a valid password
```
