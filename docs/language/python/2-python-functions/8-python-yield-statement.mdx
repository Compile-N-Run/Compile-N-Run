# Python Yield Statement

## Introduction

When working with large datasets or sequences in Python, memory efficiency becomes crucial. The `yield` statement offers an elegant solution by enabling you to create **generators** - special iterators that generate values on-the-fly instead of storing them all in memory at once.

In this tutorial, you'll learn how the `yield` statement works, how it differs from regular `return` statements, and how to leverage generators to write more memory-efficient and cleaner code.

## What is the Yield Statement?

The `yield` statement is used within a function to turn it into a generator function. Unlike a regular function that returns a value and terminates, a generator function:

- Returns a generator object
- Pauses execution when it reaches a `yield` statement
- Saves its state (local variables, position in code)
- Resumes from where it left off when called again

This "pause and resume" behavior makes generators perfect for working with large sequences or infinite streams of data.

## Basic Syntax of Yield

Here's the basic syntax of a generator function using `yield`:

```python
def generator_function():
    # Some code
    yield value1
    # More code
    yield value2
    # And so on
```

## Yield vs Return: Understanding the Difference

To understand what makes `yield` special, let's compare it with the regular `return` statement:

```python
# Function with return
def return_numbers():
    numbers = []
    for i in range(1, 6):
        numbers.append(i)
    return numbers

# Function with yield
def yield_numbers():
    for i in range(1, 6):
        yield i

# Using return function
print("Using return:")
result = return_numbers()
print(result)  # All numbers at once

# Using yield function
print("\nUsing yield:")
gen = yield_numbers()
print(next(gen))  # One number at a time
print(next(gen))
print(next(gen))
```

**Output:**
```
Using return:
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

Using yield:
1
2
3
```

Key differences:
1. The `return` function builds the entire list in memory before returning
2. The `yield` function generates each value on demand
3. The generator object maintains its state between calls to `next()`

## How Generators Work Behind the Scenes

When you call a generator function, it doesn't execute the function body immediately. Instead, it returns a generator object that implements the iterator protocol:

```python
def simple_generator():
    print("First yield")
    yield 1
    print("Second yield")
    yield 2
    print("Third yield")
    yield 3

# Create generator object
gen = simple_generator()
print(type(gen))

# Nothing is printed until we start iterating
print("\nStarting iteration:")
print(next(gen))  # Executes until first yield
print(next(gen))  # Continues from previous position
print(next(gen))  # Continues again
```

**Output:**
```
<class 'generator'>

Starting iteration:
First yield
1
Second yield
2
Third yield
3
```

If you call `next(gen)` one more time, you'll get a `StopIteration` exception, which is how Python signals the end of an iterator.

## Common Use Cases for Yield

### 1. Processing Large Files

Generators are perfect for reading large files line by line without loading the entire file into memory:

```python
def read_large_file(file_path):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        for line in file:
            yield line.strip()

# Usage example
def count_lines(file_path):
    count = 0
    for line in read_large_file(file_path):
        count += 1
    return count

# This processes a large file efficiently without loading it all into memory
```

### 2. Infinite Sequences

You can create infinite sequences that would be impossible to store in memory:

```python
def fibonacci():
    a, b = 0, 1
    while True:
        yield a
        a, b = b, a + b

# Get first 10 fibonacci numbers
fib = fibonacci()
for _ in range(10):
    print(next(fib), end=" ")
```

**Output:**
```
0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 
```

### 3. Pipelining Data Processing

Generators can be used to create data processing pipelines:

```python
def read_data(file_path):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as f:
        for line in f:
            yield line.strip()

def parse_data(lines):
    for line in lines:
        # Assume comma-separated values
        yield line.split(',')

def filter_data(records):
    for record in records:
        if len(record) >= 2 and record[1].isdigit() and int(record[1]) > 30:
            yield record

# Usage example (assuming you have a data.csv file)
# pipeline = filter_data(parse_data(read_data('data.csv')))
# for record in pipeline:
#     print(record)
```

## Generator Expressions

Similar to list comprehensions, Python provides a concise way to create generators called generator expressions:

```python
# List comprehension (creates entire list in memory)
numbers_list = [x*x for x in range(1000000)]

# Generator expression (creates generator object)
numbers_gen = (x*x for x in range(1000000))

# Compare memory usage
import sys
print(f"List size: {sys.getsizeof(numbers_list)} bytes")
print(f"Generator size: {sys.getsizeof(numbers_gen)} bytes")

# We can iterate over the generator
for i, num in enumerate(numbers_gen):
    if i < 5:
        print(num, end=" ")
    else:
        break
```

**Output (sizes may vary):**
```
List size: 8448728 bytes
Generator size: 112 bytes
0 1 4 9 16 
```

The memory difference is significant!

## Advanced Generator Features

### Sending Values to Generators with .send()

Generators can receive values from outside using the `.send()` method:

```python
def echo_generator():
    while True:
        received = yield
        print(f"Received: {received}")

g = echo_generator()
next(g)  # Prime the generator
g.send("Hello")
g.send("World")
```

**Output:**
```
Received: Hello
Received: World
```

### Two-way Communication

You can both receive and send values with generators:

```python
def compute_average():
    count = 0
    total = 0
    average = 0
    
    while True:
        # Yield current average, then receive next value
        value = yield average
        
        if value is not None:
            count += 1
            total += value
            average = total / count

# Use the generator
avg_gen = compute_average()
next(avg_gen)  # Start the generator (returns 0)

print(avg_gen.send(10))  # Send 10, get average
print(avg_gen.send(20))  # Send 20, get new average
print(avg_gen.send(30))  # Send 30, get new average
```

**Output:**
```
10.0
15.0
20.0
```

## Real-World Example: Batch Processing

Here's a practical example of using generators for batch processing:

```python
def data_source(items):
    """Simulate fetching data from a source"""
    for item in items:
        yield item

def process_batches(data, batch_size=3):
    """Process data in batches"""
    batch = []
    
    for item in data:
        batch.append(item)
        
        if len(batch) >= batch_size:
            yield batch
            batch = []
            
    # Don't forget the last incomplete batch
    if batch:
        yield batch

# Sample data
all_data = range(1, 11)  # Numbers 1-10

# Create processing pipeline
source = data_source(all_data)
batches = process_batches(source, batch_size=3)

# Process each batch
for i, batch in enumerate(batches, 1):
    print(f"Processing batch {i}: {batch}")
    # Do something with the batch
```

**Output:**
```
Processing batch 1: [1, 2, 3]
Processing batch 2: [4, 5, 6]
Processing batch 3: [7, 8, 9]
Processing batch 4: [10]
```

This approach is memory-efficient even with very large datasets, as it only keeps one batch in memory at a time.

## Best Practices for Using Yield

1. **Use generators for large sequences**: When dealing with large amounts of data, generators help reduce memory usage
2. **Use generators for calculated sequences**: When each item requires calculation, generators compute values on demand
3. **Use generators for infinite sequences**: For potentially infinite streams of data (like monitoring systems)
4. **Keep generator functions focused**: Each generator should have a single responsibility
5. **Consider using generator expressions** for simple cases where a full function isn't needed

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Trying to reuse generators**: Once a generator is exhausted, you need to recreate it to use it again
2. **Accessing generator values by index**: Generators don't support indexing - you have to iterate through them
3. **Forgetting that generators are single-use**: You can't reset or rewind a generator to the beginning

## Summary

The `yield` statement is a powerful tool in Python that enables you to:

- Create generator functions that produce values on-demand
- Process large datasets efficiently with minimal memory usage
- Build data pipelines that process information incrementally
- Create infinite sequences that would be impossible with regular collections

Generators represent a fundamental shift in how data is processed: from "compute everything at once" to "compute only what you need, when you need it."

## Exercises

1. Write a generator function that produces the first n prime numbers
2. Create a generator that reads a CSV file and yields each row as a dictionary
3. Build a data processing pipeline using multiple generators that:
   - Reads numbers from a file
   - Filters out non-numeric values
   - Converts them to integers
   - Yields only the even numbers
4. Implement a windowing generator that, given a list and window size, yields overlapping sublists of the specified window size
