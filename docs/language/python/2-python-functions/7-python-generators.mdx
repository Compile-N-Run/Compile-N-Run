# Python Generators

## Introduction

Have you ever needed to work with a large sequence of values in Python but worried about memory consumption? Python generators offer an elegant solution to this problem. Generators are special functions that allow you to create iterators in a simple and clean way.

Unlike regular functions that return a value and complete their execution, generators yield a sequence of values over time. This makes them incredibly memory-efficient for working with large datasets and creating data pipelines.

In this tutorial, we'll explore Python generators in depth, from basic concepts to practical applications.

## What Are Generators?

A generator is a special type of function that returns a lazy iterator. Instead of computing all values at once and storing them in memory, generators produce items one at a time and only when requested. This "lazy evaluation" approach can save significant memory resources.

The key difference between a regular function and a generator function is that a generator uses the `yield` keyword instead of `return`. When a generator function is called, it returns a generator object without executing the function body. The code within the generator function only runs when the `next()` method is called on the generator object.

## Creating Your First Generator

Let's create a simple generator function:

```python
def simple_generator():
    print("First yield")
    yield 1
    print("Second yield")
    yield 2
    print("Third yield")
    yield 3
```

To use this generator, we need to create a generator object and then iterate through it:

```python
# Create a generator object
gen = simple_generator()

# Get the first value
print(next(gen))  # Outputs: First yield, then 1

# Get the second value
print(next(gen))  # Outputs: Second yield, then 2

# Get the third value
print(next(gen))  # Outputs: Third yield, then 3

# If we try to get another value, it will raise StopIteration
# print(next(gen))  # StopIteration error
```

### Output:
```
First yield
1
Second yield
2
Third yield
3
```

Notice that the print statements inside the generator are only executed when `next()` is called. The generator "remembers" where it left off each time.

## Generator Expressions

Similar to list comprehensions, Python provides generator expressions for creating generators in a concise way:

```python
# List comprehension - creates the entire list in memory
numbers_list = [x * x for x in range(10)]
print(numbers_list)

# Generator expression - creates a generator object
numbers_generator = (x * x for x in range(10))
print(numbers_generator)

# Iterating through the generator
for num in numbers_generator:
    print(num, end=' ')
```

### Output:
```
[0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81]
<generator object <genexpr> at 0x...>
0 1 4 9 16 25 36 49 64 81 
```

Notice that the generator expression uses parentheses `()` instead of square brackets `[]`.

## Why Use Generators?

There are several compelling reasons to use generators:

1. **Memory Efficiency**: Generators produce values on-the-fly without storing the entire sequence in memory.
2. **Infinite Sequences**: You can represent infinite sequences (like an endless stream of data).
3. **Pipelining**: Generators can be used to create data pipelines where data flows through multiple transformations.
4. **Improved Performance**: For large datasets, generators can provide better performance by avoiding the need to load everything into memory at once.

## Memory Efficiency Example

Let's compare memory usage between a list and a generator when working with large sequences:

```python
import sys

# Create a list of 1 million numbers
big_list = [i for i in range(1000000)]
print(f"List size: {sys.getsizeof(big_list) / (1024 * 1024):.2f} MB")

# Create a generator for 1 million numbers
big_generator = (i for i in range(1000000))
print(f"Generator size: {sys.getsizeof(big_generator) / 1024:.2f} KB")
```

### Output:
```
List size: 8.39 MB
Generator size: 0.11 KB
```

The difference is dramatic! The generator object is thousands of times smaller because it doesn't store all the values at once.

## Creating Infinite Sequences

Generators make it simple to create infinite sequences - something impossible with regular lists:

```python
def fibonacci_generator():
    a, b = 0, 1
    while True:
        yield a
        a, b = b, a + b

# Create a generator for Fibonacci numbers
fib = fibonacci_generator()

# Get the first 10 Fibonacci numbers
print("First 10 Fibonacci numbers:")
for _ in range(10):
    print(next(fib), end=' ')
```

### Output:
```
First 10 Fibonacci numbers:
0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 
```

This generator could theoretically produce Fibonacci numbers forever without running out of memory!

## The `yield` Statement in Depth

The `yield` statement is what makes generators special. When a `yield` statement is executed:

1. The current state of the function is saved
2. The yielded value is returned to the caller
3. When `next()` is called again, execution resumes after the yield statement

This behavior allows generators to maintain state between calls:

```python
def counter_generator():
    count = 0
    while True:
        updated_value = yield count
        if updated_value is not None:
            count = updated_value
        else:
            count += 1

# Create the counter generator
counter = counter_generator()

# Get the initial value
print(next(counter))  # 0

# Get the next values
print(next(counter))  # 1
print(next(counter))  # 2

# Update the counter value
print(counter.send(10))  # 10

# Continue counting from the new value
print(next(counter))  # 11
print(next(counter))  # 12
```

### Output:
```
0
1
2
10
11
12
```

The `send()` method allows us to pass a value back to the generator, which becomes the result of the `yield` expression.

## Generator Methods

Generators have several special methods:

- `next()`: Gets the next value from the generator
- `send()`: Sends a value to the generator
- `throw()`: Raises an exception inside the generator
- `close()`: Closes the generator

Here's an example of the `close()` method:

```python
def closeable_generator():
    try:
        yield 1
        yield 2
        yield 3
    finally:
        print("Generator closed!")

gen = closeable_generator()
print(next(gen))  # 1
print(next(gen))  # 2
gen.close()  # Closes the generator, executing the finally block
```

### Output:
```
1
2
Generator closed!
```

## Practical Applications

Let's look at some real-world applications of generators:

### 1. Processing Large Files

Generators are perfect for processing large files without loading them entirely into memory:

```python
def read_large_file(file_path):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        for line in file:
            yield line.strip()

# Usage example (commented out as we don't have the actual file)
# for line in read_large_file('very_large_file.txt'):
#     if 'important info' in line:
#         print(line)
```

### 2. Data Pipeline

Generators can be used to create efficient data pipelines:

```python
def read_data(file_path):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        for line in file:
            yield line.strip()

def parse_data(lines):
    for line in lines:
        # Assume each line is a comma-separated string
        yield line.split(',')

def filter_data(rows):
    for row in rows:
        if len(row) >= 2 and int(row[1]) > 100:
            yield row

def transform_data(rows):
    for row in rows:
        yield {
            'name': row[0],
            'value': int(row[1]),
            'category': row[2] if len(row) > 2 else 'Unknown'
        }

# Create a complete pipeline (this is efficient and doesn't load all data at once)
# Usage example:
# data_source = read_data('data.csv')
# parsed_data = parse_data(data_source)
# filtered_data = filter_data(parsed_data)
# results = transform_data(filtered_data)
#
# for item in results:
#     print(item)
```

### 3. Custom Iteration Logic

Generators are useful for implementing custom iteration logic:

```python
def alternating_items(*iterables):
    """
    Alternates items from multiple iterables until all are exhausted.
    """
    iterators = [iter(iterable) for iterable in iterables]
    active_iterators = len(iterators)
    
    while active_iterators > 0:
        for i, iterator in enumerate(iterators):
            try:
                yield next(iterator)
            except StopIteration:
                active_iterators -= 1
                iterators[i] = iter([])  # Replace with empty iterator

# Example usage
letters = ['a', 'b', 'c']
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
symbols = ['!', '@', '#']

for item in alternating_items(letters, numbers, symbols):
    print(item, end=' ')
```

### Output:
```
a 1 ! b 2 @ c 3 # 4 
```

## Generator Chaining

One powerful feature of generators is that they can be chained together to create complex data processing pipelines:

```python
def numbers():
    for i in range(1, 11):
        yield i

def square(nums):
    for num in nums:
        yield num * num

def convert_to_string(nums):
    for num in nums:
        yield f"The number is: {num}"

# Chain the generators
number_pipeline = convert_to_string(square(numbers()))

for item in number_pipeline:
    print(item)
```

### Output:
```
The number is: 1
The number is: 4
The number is: 9
The number is: 16
The number is: 25
The number is: 36
The number is: 49
The number is: 64
The number is: 81
The number is: 100
```

## Yield From

Python 3.3 introduced the `yield from` expression, which simplifies generator delegation:

```python
def subgenerator():
    yield 1
    yield 2
    yield 3

def main_generator():
    yield 'Start'
    # Instead of:
    # for item in subgenerator():
    #     yield item
    yield from subgenerator()
    yield 'End'

for item in main_generator():
    print(item)
```

### Output:
```
Start
1
2
3
End
```

`yield from` is not just a shortcut for a for loop - it also properly handles the values sent to the generator and exceptions.

## Summary

Python generators are a powerful feature that enables you to:

- Create memory-efficient iterators
- Process large datasets without loading everything into memory
- Create infinite sequences
- Build efficient data processing pipelines
- Maintain state between iterations

Generators use the `yield` statement to produce values one at a time, allowing for lazy evaluation of sequences. This makes them perfect for situations where you need to work with large amounts of data or create complex iteration patterns.

## Practice Exercises

1. Create a generator function that produces the first n prime numbers.
2. Write a generator function that reads a CSV file and yields each row as a dictionary.
3. Implement a generator-based solution to the classic "FizzBuzz" problem.
4. Create a generator that yields all possible combinations of elements from two lists.
5. Build a data processing pipeline using generators that reads a log file, filters lines containing errors, and extracts the timestamp and error message.
