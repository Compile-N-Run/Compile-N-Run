# Python Lambda Functions

## Introduction

Lambda functions are one of Python's most elegant features, providing a way to create small, anonymous functions on-the-fly. While regular functions are defined using the `def` keyword, lambda functions are defined using the `lambda` keyword and don't require a name. They are perfect for simple operations where a full function definition would be overly verbose.

In this tutorial, we'll explore what lambda functions are, how they work, and when to use them in your Python code.

## What are Lambda Functions?

A lambda function is a small, anonymous function that can take any number of arguments but can only have one expression. These functions are also called "anonymous functions" because they don't have a name like regular functions defined with `def`.

### Basic Syntax

The syntax of a lambda function is:

```python
lambda arguments: expression
```

Where:
- `lambda` is the keyword that defines the function
- `arguments` are the input parameters (can be multiple, separated by commas)
- `expression` is a single expression that is evaluated and returned

## Creating Your First Lambda Function

Let's start with a simple example to understand how lambda functions work:

```python
# Regular function to square a number
def square(x):
    return x * x

# Equivalent lambda function
square_lambda = lambda x: x * x

# Let's test both functions
print(square(5))      # Output: 25
print(square_lambda(5))  # Output: 25
```

In this example, both functions do exactly the same thing - they square the input number. However, the lambda function is more concise.

## When to Use Lambda Functions

Lambda functions are most useful in situations where:

1. You need a simple function for a short period of time
2. You want to pass a function as an argument to another function
3. You need to define a function inside another function

### Example 1: Lambda with Built-in Functions

Lambda functions work great with Python's built-in functions like `map()`, `filter()`, and `sorted()`.

#### Using lambda with `map()`

The `map()` function applies a function to each item in an iterable:

```python
# Using a regular function with map
def double(x):
    return x * 2

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
doubled_numbers = list(map(double, numbers))
print(doubled_numbers)  # Output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]

# Using lambda with map
doubled_numbers_lambda = list(map(lambda x: x * 2, numbers))
print(doubled_numbers_lambda)  # Output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```

#### Using lambda with `filter()`

The `filter()` function creates a list of elements for which a function returns true:

```python
# Get even numbers using a regular function
def is_even(x):
    return x % 2 == 0

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
even_numbers = list(filter(is_even, numbers))
print(even_numbers)  # Output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]

# Get even numbers using lambda
even_numbers_lambda = list(filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, numbers))
print(even_numbers_lambda)  # Output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```

#### Using lambda with `sorted()`

The `sorted()` function can take a key function to specify how to sort:

```python
# Sort a list of tuples by the second item
pairs = [(1, 'one'), (3, 'three'), (2, 'two'), (4, 'four')]
sorted_pairs = sorted(pairs, key=lambda pair: pair[1])
print(sorted_pairs)  # Output: [(4, 'four'), (1, 'one'), (3, 'three'), (2, 'two')]
```

### Example 2: Lambda Functions in Customized Sorting

Let's sort a list of dictionaries by a specific key:

```python
students = [
    {'name': 'Alice', 'grade': 88},
    {'name': 'Bob', 'grade': 92},
    {'name': 'Charlie', 'grade': 85},
    {'name': 'David', 'grade': 79}
]

# Sort by grade in descending order
sorted_students = sorted(students, key=lambda student: student['grade'], reverse=True)
print(sorted_students)
# Output: [
#   {'name': 'Bob', 'grade': 92},
#   {'name': 'Alice', 'grade': 88},
#   {'name': 'Charlie', 'grade': 85},
#   {'name': 'David', 'grade': 79}
# ]
```

## Multiple Arguments in Lambda Functions

Lambda functions can take multiple arguments, just like regular functions:

```python
# Regular function with multiple arguments
def add(x, y):
    return x + y

# Equivalent lambda function
add_lambda = lambda x, y: x + y

print(add(3, 5))       # Output: 8
print(add_lambda(3, 5))  # Output: 8
```

You can even use default arguments:

```python
greet = lambda name, greeting="Hello": f"{greeting}, {name}!"
print(greet("Alice"))           # Output: Hello, Alice!
print(greet("Bob", "Hi there"))  # Output: Hi there, Bob!
```

## Lambda Functions with Conditionals

Although lambda functions are limited to a single expression, you can include conditional expressions:

```python
# Using a conditional expression in a lambda function
get_status = lambda score: "Pass" if score >= 60 else "Fail"

print(get_status(75))  # Output: Pass
print(get_status(45))  # Output: Fail
```

## Real-world Applications

### Application 1: Data Processing Pipeline

Lambda functions are excellent for data processing workflows:

```python
data = [
    {"name": "Alice", "age": 25, "salary": 60000},
    {"name": "Bob", "age": 30, "salary": 75000},
    {"name": "Charlie", "age": 35, "salary": 90000},
    {"name": "David", "age": 40, "salary": 100000}
]

# Create a pipeline to:
# 1. Filter employees over 30
# 2. Calculate their bonuses (10% of salary)
# 3. Format the result as a string

result = list(map(
    lambda emp: f"{emp['name']}'s bonus is ${emp['salary'] * 0.1:.2f}",
    filter(lambda emp: emp['age'] > 30, data)
))

for item in result:
    print(item)

# Output:
# Charlie's bonus is $9000.00
# David's bonus is $10000.00
```

### Application 2: GUI Event Handlers

Lambda functions are often used in GUI programming for event handlers:

```python
import tkinter as tk

window = tk.Tk()
window.title("Lambda in GUI")

# Using lambda as a button click handler
button1 = tk.Button(window, text="Click me!", 
                    command=lambda: print("Button was clicked!"))
button1.pack()

# This is just an example, in a real application you'd include:
# window.mainloop()
```

## Limitations of Lambda Functions

While powerful, lambda functions have some limitations:

1. They can only contain expressions, not statements
2. They are limited to a single expression
3. They cannot contain assignments or `assert` statements
4. They are less readable for complex operations
5. They don't have a name, which can make debugging harder

## When to Avoid Lambda Functions

You should use regular functions instead of lambda functions when:

1. The function logic is complex
2. The same function is used in multiple places
3. You need documentation or type hints
4. You need to include error handling

## Best Practices

1. **Keep it simple**: Use lambda functions for simple operations
2. **Readability**: If a lambda becomes complex, convert it to a regular function
3. **Naming**: When assigning a lambda to a variable, consider using a regular function instead
4. **Single use**: Lambda functions shine when used as throwaway functions

## Summary

Lambda functions are a powerful feature in Python that allows you to write small, anonymous functions with a concise syntax. They are particularly useful when working with built-in functions like `map()`, `filter()`, and `sorted()`, or when you need a quick, throwaway function.

Remember that while lambda functions can make your code more compact, they should be used judiciously. For complex logic or reusable functions, regular function definitions are usually more appropriate.

## Practice Exercises

1. Write a lambda function to convert a temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit (formula: F = C * 9/5 + 32)
2. Use `filter()` and a lambda function to extract all strings that start with 'a' from a list
3. Sort a list of words by their length using a lambda function
4. Create a lambda function that checks if a number is both even and positive
5. Use `map()` and a lambda to convert a list of dictionaries to a list of names
