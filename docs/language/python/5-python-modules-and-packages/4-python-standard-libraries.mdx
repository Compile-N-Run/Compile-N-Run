# Python Standard Libraries

## Introduction

Python's power lies not just in its simple syntax and ease of learning, but also in its rich collection of built-in libraries. Python Standard Libraries are pre-installed modules that come bundled with your Python installation, offering solutions for common programming tasks without requiring additional downloads.

These libraries enable you to perform complex operations like file manipulation, mathematical calculations, web interactions, and much more with just a few lines of code. For beginners, this means you have powerful tools at your fingertips from day one!

## What are Python Standard Libraries?

Python Standard Libraries are a collection of modules and packages that provide a wide range of functionality. Unlike third-party libraries that need to be installed separately, standard libraries are ready to use as soon as you install Python.

Think of them as Python's toolbox - tools for various tasks already organized and ready when you need them.

## Key Features of Python Standard Libraries

- **Pre-installed**: No additional installation required
- **Cross-platform**: Work consistently across different operating systems
- **Well-documented**: Comprehensive documentation available
- **Tested and reliable**: Maintained by the Python development community
- **Cover a vast range of functionalities**: From basic operations to complex tasks

## Common Python Standard Libraries

Let's explore some of the most commonly used standard libraries:

### 1. `math` - Mathematical Functions

The `math` module provides access to mathematical functions defined by the C standard.

```python
import math

# Calculate square root
result = math.sqrt(16)
print(f"Square root of 16 is: {result}")

# Calculate factorial
factorial = math.factorial(5)
print(f"Factorial of 5 is: {factorial}")

# Value of pi
print(f"Value of pi: {math.pi}")
```

Output:
```
Square root of 16 is: 4.0
Factorial of 5 is: 120
Value of pi: 3.141592653589793
```

### 2. `random` - Generate Random Numbers

The `random` module provides functions for generating random numbers, selecting random items, and shuffling sequences.

```python
import random

# Generate a random integer between 1 and 10
rand_int = random.randint(1, 10)
print(f"Random integer: {rand_int}")

# Select a random element from a list
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "date", "elderberry"]
random_fruit = random.choice(fruits)
print(f"Randomly selected fruit: {random_fruit}")

# Shuffle a list
random.shuffle(fruits)
print(f"Shuffled list: {fruits}")
```

Output (will vary as it's random):
```
Random integer: 7
Randomly selected fruit: cherry
Shuffled list: ['date', 'elderberry', 'banana', 'cherry', 'apple']
```

### 3. `datetime` - Date and Time Handling

The `datetime` module supplies classes for manipulating dates and times.

```python
import datetime

# Get current date and time
now = datetime.datetime.now()
print(f"Current date and time: {now}")

# Create a specific date
specific_date = datetime.datetime(2023, 12, 31, 23, 59, 59)
print(f"New Year's Eve: {specific_date}")

# Calculate time difference
time_difference = specific_date - now
print(f"Days until New Year's Eve: {time_difference.days}")
```

Output (will vary based on current date):
```
Current date and time: 2023-08-15 14:30:22.456789
New Year's Eve: 2023-12-31 23:59:59
Days until New Year's Eve: 138
```

### 4. `os` - Operating System Interface

The `os` module provides functions for interacting with the operating system.

```python
import os

# Get current working directory
current_dir = os.getcwd()
print(f"Current working directory: {current_dir}")

# List files in directory
files = os.listdir('.')
print(f"Files in current directory: {files}")

# Create a new directory (if it doesn't exist)
try:
    os.mkdir('new_folder')
    print("Directory 'new_folder' created")
except FileExistsError:
    print("Directory already exists")
```

Output (will vary based on your system):
```
Current working directory: C:\Users\username\Projects
Files in current directory: ['main.py', 'data.txt', 'images']
Directory 'new_folder' created
```

### 5. `json` - JSON Encoder and Decoder

The `json` module enables you to work with JSON data.

```python
import json

# Convert Python dictionary to JSON string
user_data = {
    "name": "John Doe",
    "age": 30,
    "is_active": True,
    "courses": ["Python", "JavaScript", "Machine Learning"]
}

json_string = json.dumps(user_data, indent=4)
print(f"JSON string:\n{json_string}")

# Convert JSON string back to Python object
parsed_data = json.loads(json_string)
print(f"\nParsed name: {parsed_data['name']}")
print(f"Courses: {parsed_data['courses']}")
```

Output:
```
JSON string:
{
    "name": "John Doe",
    "age": 30,
    "is_active": true,
    "courses": [
        "Python",
        "JavaScript",
        "Machine Learning"
    ]
}

Parsed name: John Doe
Courses: ['Python', 'JavaScript', 'Machine Learning']
```

### 6. `re` - Regular Expressions

The `re` module provides regular expression matching operations.

```python
import re

# Match pattern in text
text = "Contact us at info@example.com or support@company.org"
pattern = r'[\w\.-]+@[\w\.-]+'  # Simple email pattern

emails = re.findall(pattern, text)
print(f"Found emails: {emails}")

# Replace pattern
new_text = re.sub(pattern, "[EMAIL]", text)
print(f"Text after replacement: {new_text}")
```

Output:
```
Found emails: ['info@example.com', 'support@company.org']
Text after replacement: Contact us at [EMAIL] or [EMAIL]
```

## Real-World Applications

Let's explore some practical applications using combinations of standard libraries:

### Example 1: Weather Data Logger

This example demonstrates how to create a simple program that logs temperature data with timestamps:

```python
import random
import datetime
import json
import os

def generate_temperature():
    """Generate a random temperature between 15°C and 35°C"""
    return round(random.uniform(15.0, 35.0), 1)

def log_temperature(days=7):
    """Log temperature data for specified number of days"""
    # Create data directory if it doesn't exist
    if not os.path.exists('data'):
        os.mkdir('data')
    
    # Generate temperature readings
    temperature_data = []
    start_date = datetime.datetime.now()
    
    for day in range(days):
        # Generate 3 readings per day
        day_date = start_date + datetime.timedelta(days=day)
        daily_readings = []
        
        for hour in [8, 14, 20]:  # Morning, afternoon, evening
            reading_time = day_date.replace(hour=hour, minute=0, second=0)
            daily_readings.append({
                "time": reading_time.strftime("%H:%M"),
                "temperature": generate_temperature()
            })
        
        temperature_data.append({
            "date": day_date.strftime("%Y-%m-%d"),
            "readings": daily_readings
        })
    
    # Save data to file
    with open('data/temperature_log.json', 'w') as f:
        json.dump(temperature_data, f, indent=4)
    
    return temperature_data

# Generate and display temperature log
temp_data = log_temperature(3)  # 3 days of data
print(json.dumps(temp_data, indent=2))
print(f"\nData saved to 'data/temperature_log.json'")
```

Output (will vary due to random values):
```
[
  {
    "date": "2023-08-15",
    "readings": [
      {
        "time": "08:00",
        "temperature": 18.2
      },
      {
        "time": "14:00",
        "temperature": 27.5
      },
      {
        "time": "20:00",
        "temperature": 22.8
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    "date": "2023-08-16",
    "readings": [
      {
        "time": "08:00",
        "temperature": 17.9
      },
      {
        "time": "14:00",
        "temperature": 29.1
      },
      {
        "time": "20:00",
        "temperature": 23.4
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    "date": "2023-08-17",
    "readings": [
      {
        "time": "08:00",
        "temperature": 19.5
      },
      {
        "time": "14:00",
        "temperature": 31.2
      },
      {
        "time": "20:00",
        "temperature": 24.3
      }
    ]
  }
]

Data saved to 'data/temperature_log.json'
```

### Example 2: Simple File Backup Tool

This example shows how to create a basic file backup utility:

```python
import os
import shutil
import datetime
import zipfile

def create_backup(source_dir, target_dir=None):
    """Create a backup of a directory"""
    # Set default backup directory if not specified
    if target_dir is None:
        target_dir = os.path.join(os.getcwd(), "backups")
    
    # Create backup directory if it doesn't exist
    if not os.path.exists(target_dir):
        os.mkdir(target_dir)
    
    # Generate backup filename with timestamp
    timestamp = datetime.datetime.now().strftime("%Y%m%d_%H%M%S")
    source_name = os.path.basename(source_dir)
    backup_filename = f"{source_name}_{timestamp}.zip"
    backup_path = os.path.join(target_dir, backup_filename)
    
    # Create zip archive
    with zipfile.ZipFile(backup_path, 'w') as zipf:
        for root, dirs, files in os.walk(source_dir):
            for file in files:
                file_path = os.path.join(root, file)
                # Add file to zip with relative path
                arcname = os.path.relpath(file_path, os.path.dirname(source_dir))
                zipf.write(file_path, arcname)
    
    return backup_path

# Example usage
try:
    # Replace with an actual directory you want to back up
    source_directory = "sample_data"
    
    # Create sample directory with files for demonstration
    if not os.path.exists(source_directory):
        os.mkdir(source_directory)
        
        # Create sample files
        with open(os.path.join(source_directory, "file1.txt"), 'w') as f:
            f.write("This is sample file 1")
        with open(os.path.join(source_directory, "file2.txt"), 'w') as f:
            f.write("This is sample file 2")
            
        # Create a subdirectory with a file
        subdir = os.path.join(source_directory, "subfolder")
        os.mkdir(subdir)
        with open(os.path.join(subdir, "file3.txt"), 'w') as f:
            f.write("This is sample file in subfolder")
            
    backup_file = create_backup(source_directory)
    print(f"Backup created successfully: {backup_file}")
    
    # Show backup contents
    print("\nBackup contents:")
    with zipfile.ZipFile(backup_file, 'r') as zipf:
        for item in zipf.namelist():
            print(f" - {item}")
            
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error creating backup: {e}")
```

Output:
```
Backup created successfully: backups/sample_data_20230815_152230.zip

Backup contents:
 - sample_data/file1.txt
 - sample_data/file2.txt
 - sample_data/subfolder/file3.txt
```

## How to Find and Use Standard Libraries

1. **Check the Documentation**: The official Python documentation provides comprehensive information about all standard libraries: [Python Standard Library Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html).

2. **Use Help in Python**:
   ```python
   import math
   help(math)  # Get information about the math module
   ```

3. **Use dir() Function**:
   ```python
   import datetime
   dir(datetime)  # List all attributes and methods in the datetime module
   ```

## Best Practices for Using Standard Libraries

1. **Import Only What You Need**: Use specific imports to avoid namespace pollution.
   ```python
   # Good practice
   from math import sqrt, pi
   # Instead of
   # import math
   ```

2. **Follow Naming Conventions**: When importing modules, follow standard Python naming practices.
   ```python
   import datetime as dt  # Common abbreviation
   ```

3. **Understand the Version Differences**: Some libraries may behave differently across Python versions.

4. **Check for Alternatives**: Sometimes there are newer, better alternatives to older standard libraries.
   ```python
   # Modern way
   from pathlib import Path
   path = Path("folder/file.txt")
   
   # Older way
   import os
   path = os.path.join("folder", "file.txt")
   ```
