# Python Importing Modules

Python's power and flexibility come largely from its extensive module system. Modules allow you to organize code into reusable components, making your programs more manageable and maintainable. In this guide, we'll explore how to import and use modules in Python.

## What are Python Modules?

A Python module is simply a file containing Python code. It can define functions, classes, and variables that you can use in other Python programs. Modules help organize related code into separate files, making it easier to maintain and reuse.

## The Import Statement

The basic way to use a module in your code is with the `import` statement:

```python
import math

# Now you can use functions from the math module
radius = 5
area = math.pi * (radius ** 2)
print(f"The area of a circle with radius {radius} is: {area}")
```

Output:
```
The area of a circle with radius 5 is: 78.53981633974483
```

When you import a module, you access its contents using dot notation: `module_name.item_name`.

## Importing Specific Items from a Module

If you only need specific functions or variables from a module, you can import just those items:

```python
from math import pi, sqrt

# Now you can use pi and sqrt directly without the math. prefix
radius = 5
area = pi * (radius ** 2)
print(f"The area of a circle with radius {radius} is: {area}")
print(f"The square root of 16 is: {sqrt(16)}")
```

Output:
```
The area of a circle with radius 5 is: 78.53981633974483
The square root of 16 is: 4.0
```

## Importing All Items from a Module

You can import everything from a module using the `*` wildcard, but this is generally not recommended as it can cause naming conflicts and makes it unclear where functions are coming from:

```python
from math import *

# Now you can use all math functions directly
print(f"Pi is approximately {pi}")
print(f"The cosine of 0 is: {cos(0)}")
```

Output:
```
Pi is approximately 3.141592653589793
The cosine of 0 is: 1.0
```

:::caution
Importing everything with `*` is discouraged in production code as it can lead to unexpected name conflicts and make code harder to understand.
:::

## Renaming Modules during Import

You can give a module a different name when importing it using the `as` keyword:

```python
import math as m

# Now you can use the shorter alias 'm'
radius = 5
area = m.pi * (radius ** 2)
print(f"The area of a circle with radius {radius} is: {area}")
```

Output:
```
The area of a circle with radius 5 is: 78.53981633974483
```

This is particularly useful for modules with long names or to avoid naming conflicts.

## Renaming Specific Items during Import

You can also rename specific items you import from a module:

```python
from math import pi as PI, sqrt as square_root

radius = 5
area = PI * (radius ** 2)
print(f"The area of a circle with radius {radius} is: {area}")
print(f"The square root of 16 is: {square_root(16)}")
```

Output:
```
The area of a circle with radius 5 is: 78.53981633974483
The square root of 16 is: 4.0
```

## Common Built-in Modules

Python comes with a rich standard library. Here are some commonly used built-in modules:

1. **math** - Mathematical functions
2. **random** - Random number generation
3. **datetime** - Date and time handling
4. **os** - Operating system interfaces
5. **sys** - System-specific parameters and functions
6. **json** - JSON encoding and decoding

Let's see a few practical examples:

### Working with Dates

```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# Get current date and time
now = datetime.now()
print(f"Current date and time: {now}")

# Add 5 days to current date
future_date = now + timedelta(days=5)
print(f"Date 5 days from now: {future_date}")

# Format a date as a string
formatted_date = now.strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")
print(f"Formatted date: {formatted_date}")
```

Output:
```
Current date and time: 2023-05-20 14:35:27.345612
Date 5 days from now: 2023-05-25 14:35:27.345612
Formatted date: 2023-05-20 14:35:27
```

### Working with Random Numbers

```python
import random

# Generate a random number between 1 and 10
random_number = random.randint(1, 10)
print(f"Random number between 1 and 10: {random_number}")

# Choose a random element from a list
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "date", "elderberry"]
random_fruit = random.choice(fruits)
print(f"Randomly selected fruit: {random_fruit}")

# Shuffle a list
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
random.shuffle(numbers)
print(f"Shuffled list: {numbers}")
```

Output (will vary each time you run it):
```
Random number between 1 and 10: 7
Randomly selected fruit: cherry
Shuffled list: [3, 1, 5, 2, 4]
```

### Working with Files and Directories

```python
import os

# Get current working directory
current_dir = os.getcwd()
print(f"Current directory: {current_dir}")

# List files in the current directory
files = os.listdir()
print(f"Files in current directory: {files}")

# Check if a file exists
file_exists = os.path.exists("example.txt")
print(f"Does 'example.txt' exist? {file_exists}")
```

Output (will vary based on your system):
```
Current directory: /home/user/projects
Files in current directory: ['main.py', 'data.csv', 'README.md']
Does 'example.txt' exist? False
```

## Finding Module Locations

Python looks for modules in several places. To see where Python searches for modules, you can check the `sys.path` list:

```python
import sys

print("Python searches for modules in these locations:")
for path in sys.path:
    print(f"- {path}")
```

Output (will vary based on your Python installation):
```
Python searches for modules in these locations:
- /home/user/projects
- /usr/lib/python3.9
- /usr/lib/python3.9/lib-dynload
- /usr/local/lib/python3.9/dist-packages
- /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages
```

## Creating and Importing Your Own Modules

You can create your own modules by simply writing Python code in a file with a `.py` extension.

Let's create a simple module called `calculator.py`:

```python
# calculator.py
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

def subtract(a, b):
    return a - b

def multiply(a, b):
    return a * b

def divide(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        raise ValueError("Cannot divide by zero")
    return a / b

PI = 3.14159
```

Now, in another Python file in the same directory, you can import and use your module:

```python
# main.py
import calculator

# Use functions from your custom module
result = calculator.add(5, 3)
print(f"5 + 3 = {result}")

result = calculator.multiply(4, 2)
print(f"4 × 2 = {result}")

print(f"Pi from my calculator module: {calculator.PI}")
```

Output:
```
5 + 3 = 8
4 × 2 = 8
Pi from my calculator module: 3.14159
```

You can also import specific functions from your module:

```python
# main.py
from calculator import add, multiply, PI

# Use functions directly
result = add(5, 3)
print(f"5 + 3 = {result}")

result = multiply(4, 2)
print(f"4 × 2 = {result}")

print(f"Pi from my calculator module: {PI}")
```

## The `if __name__ == "__main__"` Pattern

A common pattern in Python modules is to include code that runs only when the module is executed directly (not when it's imported). This allows a file to serve as both a module and a standalone script:

```python
# calculator.py
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

def subtract(a, b):
    return a - b

# This code only runs when calculator.py is executed directly
if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("Testing calculator module...")
    print(f"2 + 3 = {add(2, 3)}")
    print(f"5 - 2 = {subtract(5, 2)}")
```

When you run `calculator.py` directly:
```
Testing calculator module...
2 + 3 = 5
5 - 2 = 3
```

But when you import it into another file, the test code doesn't run.

## Module Search Path

Python looks for modules in the following places, in order:

1. The directory containing the input script (or the current directory if no file is specified)
2. `PYTHONPATH` (an environment variable containing directories)
3. The installation-dependent default directories (site-packages, etc.)

You can modify the search path by appending to `sys.path`:

```python
import sys

# Add a custom directory to the Python path
sys.path.append('/path/to/your/modules')

# Now you can import modules from that directory
import custom_module
```

## Summary

Understanding how to import and use modules is essential for Python development:

- **Basic imports**: `import module_name`
- **Specific imports**: `from module_name import item1, item2`
- **Aliasing**: `import module_name as alias` or `from module_name import item as alias`
- **Creating your own modules**: Create a `.py` file and import it
- **The `if __name__ == "__main__"` pattern**: Separate module code from script code

Modules allow you to organize your code, reuse functionality, and take advantage of Python's extensive standard library and third-party packages. As your projects grow in size and complexity, effective use of modules will become increasingly important.

## Exercises

1. Import the `datetime` module and print the current date in the format "YYYY-MM-DD".
2. Create a module called `geometry.py` with functions to calculate the area and perimeter of a rectangle, then import and use those functions in another file.
3. Use the `random` module to generate a list of 10 random numbers between 1 and 100.
4. Import the `os` and `sys` modules and write a program that prints your operating system name and Python version.
5. Create a module with a function that converts temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit, using the `if __name__ == "__main__"` pattern to include test cases.
