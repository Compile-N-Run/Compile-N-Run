# User Experience Monitoring

## Introduction

User Experience Monitoring (UX Monitoring) is a critical aspect of modern application observability that focuses on measuring and analyzing the performance of applications from the end-user's perspective. Unlike traditional backend monitoring, UX monitoring helps you understand how users actually experience your application in terms of speed, reliability, and overall satisfaction.

In this guide, we'll explore how to implement User Experience Monitoring using Grafana and related tools, enabling you to:

- Track real user interactions with your applications
- Measure key frontend performance metrics
- Identify and resolve user-impacting issues quickly
- Correlate frontend issues with backend problems

## Key Concepts in User Experience Monitoring

### The Frontend Monitoring Gap

Traditional monitoring often focuses on infrastructure and backend services, leaving a significant gap in understanding the actual user experience. UX Monitoring bridges this gap by providing visibility into:

- Page load times
- Frontend errors
- User interactions
- Navigation patterns
- Browser/device performance

### Core UX Metrics

The foundation of effective UX monitoring is tracking the right metrics. These typically include:

1. **Web Vitals**
   - Largest Contentful Paint (LCP): Measures loading performance
   - First Input Delay (FID): Measures interactivity
   - Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS): Measures visual stability

2. **Application Performance Metrics**
   - Time to First Byte (TTFB)
   - Time to Interactive (TTI)
   - First Contentful Paint (FCP)
   - Total Blocking Time (TBT)

3. **User Behavior Metrics**
   - Session duration
   - Error rate
   - Conversion rate
   - Bounce rate

### Real User Monitoring vs. Synthetic Monitoring

UX Monitoring can be divided into two complementary approaches:
