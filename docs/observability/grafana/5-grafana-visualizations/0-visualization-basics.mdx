# Visualization Basics

## Introduction

Data visualization is the graphical representation of information and data. In Grafana, visualizations are the building blocks of dashboards that transform your raw data into meaningful, actionable insights. This guide introduces you to visualization fundamentals in Grafana and helps you understand how to choose the right visualization type for your data.

- Highlighting outliers and anomalies
- Communicating complex information in an accessible format
- Supporting data-driven decision making
