# Panel Types Overview

## Introduction

Panels are the fundamental building blocks of any Grafana dashboard. Each panel represents a specific visualization of your data, helping you to interpret metrics and logs effectively. Whether you're monitoring system performance, analyzing business metrics, or visualizing IoT data, choosing the right panel type is crucial for creating informative and actionable dashboards.

In this guide, we'll explore the various panel types available in Grafana, their specific use cases, and how to select the most appropriate visualization for your data storytelling needs.

## What Are Grafana Panels?

A panel in Grafana is a visual representation of your data. Each panel connects to a data source, applies queries to extract specific metrics, and then visualizes that data in a format that helps you derive insights.

Every panel in Grafana follows this basic workflow:

## Core Panel Types

### Time Series Panel

The Time Series panel is perhaps the most commonly used visualization in Grafana. It displays time series data as a line, bar, or points.

**Use cases:**
- Server CPU and memory usage over time
- Application response times
- User activity metrics

**Example configuration:**

```javascript
{
  "datasource": "Prometheus",
  "targets": [
    {
      "expr": "rate(http_requests_total[5m])",
      "legendFormat": "HTTP Requests"
    }
  ],
  "type": "timeseries",
  "options": {
    "legend": {
      "calcs": ["mean", "max"],
      "displayMode": "table",
      "placement": "bottom"
    }
  }
}
```

### Gauge Panel

Gauge panels show a single value in a radial gauge, helping you to quickly identify if a metric is within expected thresholds.

**Use cases:**
- Disk space utilization
- SLA compliance
- Performance against targets

**Example configuration:**

```javascript
{
  "datasource": "Prometheus",
  "targets": [
    {
      "expr": "(node_filesystem_avail_bytes / node_filesystem_size_bytes) * 100",
      "legendFormat": "Disk Space Available"
    }
  ],
  "type": "gauge",
  "options": {
    "thresholds": {
      "steps": [
        { "value": null, "color": "red" },
        { "value": 20, "color": "orange" },
        { "value": 50, "color": "green" }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

      "refId": "A"
    }
  ],
  "type": "table",
  "options": {
    "showHeader": true,
    "sortBy": [
      {
        "displayName": "last_login",
        "desc": true
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Heatmap Panel

Heatmaps visualize data in a matrix format where individual values are represented as colors.

  }
}
```

## Choosing the Right Panel Type

Selecting the appropriate panel type depends on several factors:

1. **Data type**: Time-series data works best with line graphs, while categorical data might be better visualized using bar or pie charts.

2. **Question you're answering**: 
   - "How has this changed over time?" → Time series
   - "What's the current status?" → Gauge or Stat
   - "How does X compare to Y?" → Bar chart
   - "What's the composition of this total?" → Pie chart

3. **Dashboard context**: Consider how this panel fits with other panels on your dashboard. Are you telling a coherent story?

4. **Audience**: Technical users might prefer detailed graphs, while executives might prefer summarized stats and gauges.

Here's a decision flow to help choose the right panel:

You can set thresholds to change colors based on value ranges:

```javascript
"thresholds": {
  "mode": "absolute",
  "steps": [
    { "color": "green", "value": null },
    { "color": "yellow", "value": 70 },
    { "color": "red", "value": 90 }
  ]
}
```

### Unit Formatting

Properly formatted units make your panels more readable:

```javascript
"fieldConfig": {
  "defaults": {
    "unit": "bytes"
  }
}
```

Common units include:
- `short` (general numbers)
- `percent` (0-100%)
- `bytes` (data sizes)
- `ms` (milliseconds)
- `s` (seconds)
- `dateTimeFromNow` (relative time)

### Value Mapping

Map specific values to readable text:

```javascript
"mappings": [
  {
    "type": "value",
    "options": {
      "0": { "text": "Offline", "color": "red" },
      "1": { "text": "Online", "color": "green" }
    }
  }
]
```

## Advanced Panel Features

### Panel Linking

Link panels to other dashboards or external resources:

```javascript
"links": [
  {
    "title": "View Details",
    "url": "/d/abc123/detailed-metrics?var-server=${__series.name}"
  }
]
```

### Data Transformations

Transform your data before visualization:

```javascript
"transformations": [
  {
    "id": "organize",
    "options": {
      "excludeByName": {
        "time": true
      },
      "renameByName": {
        "value": "CPU Usage"
      }
    }
  }
]
```

### Repeat Panels

Create dynamic dashboards by repeating panels:

```javascript
"repeat": "server",
"repeatDirection": "h"
```

## Summary

Grafana offers a rich variety of panel types to visualize your data effectively. The key to creating insightful dashboards is selecting the right visualization for your specific data and use case:

- **Time Series panels** excel at showing changes over time
