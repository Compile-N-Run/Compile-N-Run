          "type": "linear"
        },
        "showPoints": "never",
        "spanNulls": true,
        "stacking": {
          "group": "A",
          "mode": "none"
        }
      },
      "mappings": [],
      "thresholds": {
        "mode": "absolute",
        "steps": [
          {
            "color": "green",
            "value": null
          },
          {
            "color": "red",
            "value": 80
          }
        ]
      },
      "unit": "short"
    }
  },
  "targets": [
    {
      "expr": "rate(node_cpu_seconds_total{mode=\"user\"}[1m])",
      "interval": "",
      "legendFormat": "{{cpu}}",
      "refId": "A"
    }
  ],
  "title": "CPU Usage",
  "type": "timeseries"
}
```

## Explore Mode

Explore is a powerful feature that allows ad-hoc querying and exploration of your data:

- **Data Source Selector** - Choose which data source to query
- **Query Editor** - Write and edit queries
- **Run Button** - Execute the query
- **Time Range** - Select the time window
- **Results Panel** - View query results

## Visualization Types

Grafana offers many visualization types to represent your data effectively:

### Common Visualization Types

- **Time Series** - For time-based line, area or bar charts
- **Gauge** - Display single values with thresholds
- **Stat** - Show single values with optional sparklines
- **Bar Chart** - Compare values across categories
- **Pie Chart** - Show proportions of a whole
- **Table** - Display data in tabular format
- **Heatmap** - Visualize data density
- **Logs** - Display log data with filtering options

Here's a diagram showing the relationship between data sources, panels, and dashboards:

    style D fill:#f9f9f9,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

## Creating Your First Dashboard

Let's walk through a simple example of creating a basic dashboard:

1. Click the "+" icon in the side menu and select "Dashboard"
2. Click "Add new panel" to add a visualization
3. Select a data source (e.g., Prometheus, InfluxDB)
4. Write a query in the query editor:

```sql
SELECT mean("cpu_usage_idle") FROM "system" WHERE $timeFilter GROUP BY time($__interval) fill(null)
```

5. Select your visualization type (e.g., Time Series)
6. Configure visualization options like axes, legends, and colors
7. Add a title for your panel, such as "CPU Usage"
8. Click "Save" to add the panel to your dashboard
9. Add additional panels as needed
10. Save the dashboard with a descriptive name

## Working with Variables

Variables make your dashboards dynamic and interactive:

```
$server = prod-app-01, prod-app-02, prod-app-03
$interval = 1m, 5m, 10m, 30m, 1h, 6h, 12h, 1d
```

When used in queries, these can be referenced like:

```sql
SELECT mean("cpu_usage_idle") FROM "system" WHERE "host" = '$server' AND $timeFilter GROUP BY time($interval) fill(null)
```

The user can then select different values from dropdown menus at the top of the dashboard.

## Practical Application: System Monitoring Dashboard

A common use case for Grafana is system monitoring. Here's a simple structure for such a dashboard:

1. **Server Overview Panel** - Key metrics at a glance
   - CPU usage
   - Memory usage
   - Disk space
   - Network traffic

2. **Detailed CPU Metrics Panel** - Breakdown of CPU usage
   - User time
   - System time
   - I/O wait
   - CPU load

3. **Memory Panel** - Memory allocation visualization
   - Used memory
   - Free memory
   - Cached memory
   - Swap usage

4. **Disk I/O Panel** - Storage performance metrics
   - Read/Write operations
   - Throughput
   - Latency

## Keyboard Shortcuts

Grafana provides keyboard shortcuts to increase productivity:

- `d` + `b` - Open/close side menu
- `d` + `h` - Go to Home dashboard
- `d` + `p` - Open Dashboard picker
- `d` + `s` - Open Search
- `esc` - Exit panel edit/view mode
- `e` - Toggle panel edit mode (when panel is focused)
