{
  "dashboard": {
    "id": null,
    "title": "My First Dashboard",
    "tags": ["demo", "getting-started"],
    "timezone": "browser",
    "panels": [
      {
        "id": 1,
        "type": "graph",
        "title": "CPU Usage",
        "datasource": "Prometheus",
        "targets": [
          {
            "expr": "rate(node_cpu_seconds_total{mode=\"user\"}[1m])",
            "legendFormat": "{{instance}} - CPU User",
            "refId": "A"
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "refresh": "10s"
  }
}
```

### Grafana Metrics (Prometheus)

Grafana Cloud includes a hosted Prometheus service for metric collection and storage:

- Scalable time-series database for metrics

Example of sending metrics to Grafana Cloud using Prometheus:

```bash
# Example Prometheus configuration to remote_write to Grafana Cloud
global:
  scrape_interval: 15s

scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'node'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:9100']

remote_write:
  - url: https://prometheus-prod-10-prod-us-east-0.grafana.net/api/prom/push
    basic_auth:
      username: '12345'
      password: 'your-grafana-cloud-api-key'
```

### Grafana Logs (Loki)

Grafana Cloud includes Loki, a log aggregation system designed to work seamlessly with Grafana:

- Efficient log storage using labels
- LogQL query language for searching and filtering logs
- Integration with existing logging agents
- Correlation between logs and metrics

Example of sending logs to Grafana Cloud using Promtail:

```yaml
# promtail-config.yaml
server:
  http_listen_port: 9080

positions:
  filename: /tmp/positions.yaml

clients:
  - url: https://logs-prod-us-central1.grafana.net/loki/api/v1/push
    basic_auth:
      username: '12345'
      password: 'your-grafana-cloud-api-key'

scrape_configs:
  - job_name: system
    static_configs:
      - targets:
          - localhost
        labels:
          job: varlogs
          __path__: /var/log/*log
```

### Grafana Traces (Tempo)

Grafana Cloud Tempo provides distributed tracing capabilities:

- OpenTelemetry and Jaeger compatible
- Trace visualization and analysis
- Service graphs and dependency mapping
- Integration with metrics and logs for context

Example of sending traces to Grafana Cloud using OpenTelemetry:

```javascript
// Example code for setting up OpenTelemetry with Grafana Tempo in a Node.js application
const { NodeTracerProvider } = require('@opentelemetry/node');
const { SimpleSpanProcessor } = require('@opentelemetry/tracing');
const { CollectorTraceExporter } = require('@opentelemetry/exporter-collector');

const provider = new NodeTracerProvider();

const exporter = new CollectorTraceExporter({
  serviceName: 'my-service',
  url: 'https://tempo-us-central1.grafana.net:443/api/traces',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Basic ' + Buffer.from('12345:your-grafana-cloud-api-key').toString('base64')
  }
});

provider.addSpanProcessor(new SimpleSpanProcessor(exporter));
provider.register();
```

### Synthetic Monitoring

Grafana Cloud includes synthetic monitoring to proactively check the availability and performance of your applications:

- HTTP checks for API endpoints
- Browser checks for web applications
- Global probe locations
- Integration with alerting system

Here's how to define a basic HTTP check:

```javascript
// Example synthetic monitoring HTTP check configuration
{
  "job": "My API Check",
  "target": "https://api.example.com/health",
  "frequency": 60000,
  "timeout": 3000,
  "probes": [
    "Europe-Frankfurt",
    "NorthAmerica-NewYork"
  ],
  "settings": {
    "http": {
      "method": "GET",
      "headers": {
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
      },
      "validStatusCodes": [200],
      "validHTTPVersions": ["HTTP/1.1", "HTTP/2.0"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Practical Use Cases

### Monitoring Kubernetes Clusters

Grafana Cloud is particularly well-suited for monitoring Kubernetes environments:

1. Install the Grafana Agent on your Kubernetes cluster:

```bash
helm repo add grafana https://grafana.github.io/helm-charts
helm repo update
helm install grafana-agent grafana/grafana-agent \
  --set grafana.cloud.apiKey=your-api-key \
  --set grafana.cloud.instanceId=your-instance-id
```

2. Configure the agent to collect metrics, logs, and traces from your cluster
3. Use pre-built Kubernetes dashboards in Grafana Cloud
4. Set up alerts for common Kubernetes issues like pod restarts or resource constraints

### Application Performance Monitoring

Implement comprehensive application monitoring:

1. Instrument your application with OpenTelemetry to collect traces
2. Configure log shipping to Loki for application logs
3. Set up custom metrics using Prometheus client libraries
4. Create dashboards that combine all three signals:

```javascript
// Example dashboard layout for a service
{
  "title": "User Service Dashboard",
  "panels": [
    {
      "title": "Request Rate",
      "type": "graph",
      "gridPos": {"x": 0, "y": 0, "w": 12, "h": 8},
      "targets": [
        {
          "expr": "sum(rate(http_requests_total{service=\"user\"}[5m])) by (endpoint)",
          "datasource": "Prometheus"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "title": "Error Logs",
      "type": "logs",
      "gridPos": {"x": 12, "y": 0, "w": 12, "h": 8},
      "targets": [
        {
          "expr": "{app=\"user-service\"} |= \"ERROR\"",
          "datasource": "Loki"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "title": "Service Latency",
      "type": "trace",
      "gridPos": {"x": 0, "y": 8, "w": 24, "h": 8},
      "targets": [
        {
          "query": "service.name=\"user-service\"",
          "datasource": "Tempo"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```
