# Label Filter Expressions

## Introduction

Label filter expressions are a fundamental component of LogQL, Grafana Loki's query language. They allow you to narrow down your log data based on metadata labels attached to your logs. Understanding how to craft effective label filter expressions is essential for efficiently querying and analyzing your log data in Loki.

In this guide, we'll explore the syntax and capabilities of label filter expressions, providing practical examples to help you master this important aspect of LogQL.

## What Are Labels in Loki?

Before diving into filter expressions, let's understand what labels are:

Labels in Loki are key-value pairs that are attached to log streams. They act as metadata that helps categorize and identify your logs. For example:

- `app="frontend"`
- `environment="production"`
- `server="us-west1"`

These labels provide context about where logs are coming from and make it possible to query specific subsets of your log data.

## Basic Label Filter Syntax

The basic syntax for a label filter expression in LogQL is:

```logql
{label="value"}
```

This will match all log streams that have the exact label and value specified. Let's look at some examples:

```logql
{app="frontend"}
```

This query returns all logs from streams labeled with `app="frontend"`.

```logql
{environment="production", server="us-west1"}
```

This query returns logs that match both conditions, retrieving production logs from the us-west1 server.

## Label Matching Operators

LogQL supports various operators for more flexible label matching:

| Operator | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `=` | Exact match | `{app="frontend"}` |
| `!=` | Not equal | `{app!="backend"}` |
| `=~` | Regex match | `{app=~"front.*"}` |
| `!~` | Regex not match | `{app!~"back.*"}` |

### Examples:

#### Exact Match

```logql
{app="frontend"}
```

Matches logs where the app label equals exactly "frontend".

#### Negative Match

```logql
{app!="backend"}
```

Matches logs where the app label is not "backend".

#### Regex Match

```logql
{app=~"front.*"}
```

Matches logs where the app label starts with "front" (e.g., "frontend", "frontapi").

#### Regex Negative Match

```logql
{app!~"test.*"}
```

Matches logs where the app label does not start with "test".

## Combining Multiple Label Filters

You can combine multiple label expressions to create more specific queries:

```logql
{app="frontend", environment="production", server=~"us-.*"}
```

This query matches logs from:
- App labeled as "frontend"
- Environment labeled as "production"
- Server matching the regex pattern "us-.*" (any server starting with "us-")

## Label Existence Checks

Sometimes you want to check if a label exists or doesn't exist, regardless of its value:

### Check if Label Exists

There isn't a direct operator for this, but you can use regex to achieve the same result:

```logql
{app=~".+"}
```

This matches logs where the "app" label exists with any non-empty value.

### Check if Label Doesn't Exist

Similarly, to check if a label doesn't exist or has an empty value:

```logql
{app!~".+"}
```

## Case Sensitivity

By default, label matching in LogQL is case-sensitive. To perform case-insensitive matching, you can use regex with the `(?i)` flag:

```logql
{app=~"(?i)frontend"}
```

This will match "frontend", "Frontend", "FRONTEND", etc.

## Escaping Special Characters

When your label values contain special characters, you need to escape them properly:

```logql
{app="front-end:v1.2"}
```

For regex operators, remember to escape special characters like `.`, `+`, `*`, etc.:

```logql
{version=~"1\\.2\\..*"}
```

This matches versions starting with "1.2.".

## Practical Examples

Let's explore some real-world examples to see label filters in action:

### Example 1: Filtering application logs in different environments

```logql
{app="payment-service", environment=~"(staging|production)"}
```

This query fetches logs from the payment service in either staging or production environments.

### Example 2: Troubleshooting specific error sources

```logql
{app="user-service", level="error", component!~"health-check.*"}
```

This finds error logs from the user service, excluding health check components.

### Example 3: Analyzing regional performance

```logql
{app="api-gateway", region=~"eu-.*", status_code=~"5.."}
```

This locates 5xx error status codes from API gateways in European regions.

## Performance Considerations

Label filters are evaluated first in LogQL queries, so they're crucial for performance. Consider these tips:

1. **Be as specific as possible** with your label filters to reduce the amount of data processed.
2. **Prefer exact match over regex** when possible, as regex operations are more computationally expensive.
3. **Filter on high-cardinality labels first** to narrow down the dataset early.

For example, this query is more efficient:

```logql
{app="frontend", environment="production"} |= "error"
```

Than filtering on the log content first:

```logql
{} |= "error" |= "frontend" |= "production"
```

## Label Filters vs. Line Filters

It's important to understand the difference between label filters (which we've covered) and line filters in LogQL:

- **Label filters** `{app="frontend"}` operate on metadata and are processed first.
- **Line filters** `|= "error"` operate on log content and are processed after label filtering.

A complete query might look like:

```logql
{app="frontend", environment="production"} |= "error" != "health check"
```

This first uses label filters to select logs from the production frontend, then filters for lines containing "error" but not "health check".

## Summary

Label filter expressions are a powerful feature of LogQL that allow you to efficiently query and analyze your logs in Grafana Loki. Key points to remember:

- Labels are key-value metadata pairs attached to log streams
- Basic syntax is `{label="value"}`
- Available operators include `=` (equals), `!=` (not equals), `=~` (regex match), and `!~` (regex not match)
- Multiple label filters are combined with commas, creating an AND condition
- Label filters are processed before line filters for better performance

By mastering label filter expressions, you'll be able to construct more effective and efficient LogQL queries, helping you better understand and troubleshoot your applications.

## Exercises

1. Write a label filter expression to match logs from either the "frontend" or "backend" applications in the "production" environment.
2. Create a query to find error logs from any service except for the "monitoring" service.
3. Write a query to find logs from servers in the "us-east" region with IDs between 1 and 5.
