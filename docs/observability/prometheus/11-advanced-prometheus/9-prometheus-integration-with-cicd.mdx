# Prometheus Integration with CI/CD

## Introduction

Monitoring your applications is just as important as deploying them. By integrating Prometheus with your Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines, you can automate monitoring setup alongside your application deployments. This ensures that every new release is automatically monitored, performance metrics are tracked across deployments, and any regressions are quickly identified.

In this guide, we'll explore how to seamlessly incorporate Prometheus monitoring into your CI/CD workflow, allowing you to build observability into your delivery pipeline rather than treating it as an afterthought.

## Understanding the Integration Points

Before diving into implementation, let's understand where Prometheus fits in a CI/CD pipeline:

    subgraph "CI Pipeline"
        A[Code Commit] --> B[Build]
        B --> C[Unit Tests]
        C --> D[Integration Tests]
        D --> E[Create Artifacts]
    end
    
    subgraph "CD Pipeline"
        E --> F[Deploy to Staging]
        F --> G[Deploy to Production]
    end

        L[Update Prometheus Config] -.-> G
        M[Deploy Exporters] -.-> G
        N[Activate Alerts] -.-> G
        O[Apply Production Dashboards] -.-> G
    end
