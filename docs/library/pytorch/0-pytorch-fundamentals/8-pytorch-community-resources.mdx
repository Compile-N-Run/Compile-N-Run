## Learning Resources

### PyTorch Tutorials and Examples

PyTorch offers comprehensive [tutorials](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/) covering various topics:

1. **Beginner tutorials**: Basic operations, autograd, neural networks
2. **Intermediate tutorials**: Custom datasets, data loading, visualization
3. **Advanced tutorials**: Deployment, distributed training, quantization

The tutorials provide code snippets that you can run directly:

```python
# Example from PyTorch tutorials on creating a simple neural network
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F

class SimpleNet(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SimpleNet, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(784, 128)  # Input layer to hidden layer
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(128, 64)   # Hidden layer to hidden layer
        self.fc3 = nn.Linear(64, 10)    # Hidden layer to output layer
        
    def forward(self, x):
        x = x.view(-1, 784)  # Reshape input
        x = F.relu(self.fc1(x))  # First layer with ReLU activation
        x = F.relu(self.fc2(x))  # Second layer with ReLU activation
        x = self.fc3(x)          # Output layer
        return F.log_softmax(x, dim=1)  # Log softmax for output

# Create an instance of the model
model = SimpleNet()
print(model)
```

Output:
```
SimpleNet(
  (fc1): Linear(in_features=784, out_features=128, bias=True)
  (fc2): Linear(in_features=128, out_features=64, bias=True)
  (fc3): Linear(in_features=64, out_features=10, bias=True)
)
```

Let's see how to use TorchVision to load a pre-trained model:

```python
import torch
import torchvision.models as models

# Load a pre-trained ResNet model
resnet = models.resnet18(pretrained=True)

# Set the model to evaluation mode
resnet.eval()

print(f"Model architecture: {resnet.__class__.__name__}")
print(f"Number of parameters: {sum(p.numel() for p in resnet.parameters())}")
```

Output:
```
Model architecture: ResNet
Number of parameters: 11689512
```

### Hugging Face ðŸ¤—

[Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/) provides PyTorch implementations of state-of-the-art NLP models:

```python
# Using Hugging Face transformers with PyTorch
from transformers import BertModel, BertTokenizer

# Load pre-trained model and tokenizer
tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')
model = BertModel.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')

# Tokenize input text
text = "Hello, how are you? I am learning PyTorch!"
encoded_input = tokenizer(text, return_tensors='pt')  # 'pt' returns PyTorch tensors

# Get model outputs
with torch.no_grad():
    output = model(**encoded_input)

# Print shape of the last hidden state
print(f"Output shape: {output.last_hidden_state.shape}")
```

Output:
```
Output shape: torch.Size([1, 11, 768])
```

## Real-World Application: Getting Help from the Community

Let's say you're struggling with a specific issue in PyTorch. Here's how you can effectively get help:

1. **Define your problem clearly**:
```python
# Problem: I'm trying to implement transfer learning but getting this error
import torch
import torchvision.models as models

model = models.resnet18(pretrained=True)

# Error occurs when I try to modify the final layer
# TypeError: 'int' object is not callable
num_features = model.fc(512)  # This is incorrect
```

2. **Correct approach after community help**:
```python
# Correct implementation based on community feedback
import torch
import torchvision.models as models

model = models.resnet18(pretrained=True)

# Get the number of input features to the final fully connected layer
num_features = model.fc.in_features

# Replace the final fully connected layer
num_classes = 10  # Example: 10 output classes
model.fc = torch.nn.Linear(num_features, num_classes)

print(f"Modified final layer: {model.fc}")
```

Output:
```
Modified final layer: Linear(in_features=512, out_features=10, bias=True)
```
