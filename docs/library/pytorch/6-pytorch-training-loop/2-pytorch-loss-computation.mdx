# PyTorch Loss Computation

In any neural network training process, one of the most crucial components is the loss computation. The loss function quantifies how far our model's predictions are from the actual target values. In this tutorial, we'll explore how to compute and use loss functions in PyTorch training loops.

## Introduction to Loss Functions

Loss functions (also called cost functions or objective functions) measure the discrepancy between our model's predictions and the ground truth. The primary goal of training a neural network is to minimize this loss value through optimization techniques like gradient descent.

A lower loss value indicates that our model is making predictions that are closer to the actual target values, which is what we aim for during training.

## Common Loss Functions in PyTorch

PyTorch provides a variety of built-in loss functions through the `torch.nn` module. Let's explore some of the most commonly used ones:

### Mean Squared Error (MSE Loss)

MSE is commonly used for regression problems. It calculates the average of squared differences between predictions and actual values.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

# Create random predictions and targets
predictions = torch.randn(3, 5)
targets = torch.randn(3, 5)

# Initialize the MSE loss function
mse_loss = nn.MSELoss()

# Compute the loss
loss = mse_loss(predictions, targets)
print(f"MSE Loss: {loss.item()}")
```

Output:
```
MSE Loss: 1.5234767198562622
```

### Cross-Entropy Loss

Cross-entropy loss is widely used for classification problems. It measures the performance of a classification model whose output is a probability value between 0 and 1.

```python
# For multi-class classification
# Create random predictions (logits) and target classes
batch_size = 5
num_classes = 3

logits = torch.randn(batch_size, num_classes)  # Raw model outputs before softmax
targets = torch.randint(0, num_classes, (batch_size,))  # Target classes (0, 1, or 2)

# Initialize Cross-Entropy Loss
cross_entropy = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()

# Compute the loss
loss = cross_entropy(logits, targets)
print(f"Cross-Entropy Loss: {loss.item()}")

# For a visual understanding, let's see the actual predictions and targets
print("\nLogits (raw model outputs):")
print(logits)
print("\nTarget classes:")
print(targets)
```

Output:
```
Cross-Entropy Loss: 1.1791393756866455

Logits (raw model outputs):
tensor([[ 0.1754,  0.2456, -0.8943],
        [ 0.7282, -1.4948,  0.5863],
        [-0.5893,  0.2928,  1.1323],
        [-0.6918,  0.8346, -0.7237],
        [ 0.1821, -0.1339,  0.5116]])

Target classes:
tensor([2, 0, 1, 2, 0])
```

### Binary Cross-Entropy Loss

For binary classification problems, where we're predicting just two classes (0 or 1).

```python
# For binary classification
sigmoid = nn.Sigmoid()
binary_logits = torch.randn(5)  # Raw outputs
binary_targets = torch.randint(0, 2, (5,)).float()  # Binary targets (0 or 1)

# Apply sigmoid to convert logits to probabilities
probabilities = sigmoid(binary_logits)

# Initialize Binary Cross-Entropy Loss
bce_loss = nn.BCELoss()

# Compute the loss
loss = bce_loss(probabilities, binary_targets)
print(f"Binary Cross-Entropy Loss: {loss.item()}")

# Show the probabilities and targets
print("\nProbabilities:")
print(probabilities)
print("\nBinary Targets:")
print(binary_targets)
```

Output:
```
Binary Cross-Entropy Loss: 0.5768427848815918

Probabilities:
tensor([0.1873, 0.8720, 0.1158, 0.9553, 0.5881])

Binary Targets:
tensor([0., 1., 0., 1., 0.])
```

## Loss Function with Reduction Methods

PyTorch loss functions typically support different reduction methods:

- `'mean'`: This is the default. It computes the average of the losses.
- `'sum'`: This computes the sum of the losses.
- `'none'`: This returns the loss for each individual sample.

```python
# Demonstrating different reduction methods
predictions = torch.randn(4, 3)
targets = torch.randn(4, 3)

# Mean reduction (default)
mse_mean = nn.MSELoss(reduction='mean')
loss_mean = mse_mean(predictions, targets)

# Sum reduction
mse_sum = nn.MSELoss(reduction='sum')
loss_sum = mse_sum(predictions, targets)

# No reduction
mse_none = nn.MSELoss(reduction='none')
loss_none = mse_none(predictions, targets)

print(f"MSE with mean reduction: {loss_mean.item()}")
print(f"MSE with sum reduction: {loss_sum.item()}")
print(f"MSE with no reduction (showing shape): {loss_none.shape}")
print(loss_none)
```

Output:
```
MSE with mean reduction: 1.425689697265625
MSE with sum reduction: 17.1082763671875
MSE with no reduction (showing shape): torch.Size([4, 3])
tensor([[1.4235, 2.2047, 0.8461],
        [1.8764, 0.9928, 1.0942],
        [0.9283, 2.4176, 1.8432],
        [1.6810, 0.8512, 0.9430]])
```

## Custom Loss Functions in PyTorch

While PyTorch provides many common loss functions, you might need to create a custom loss for specific use cases. You can do this by either:

1. Using PyTorch's arithmetic operations directly
2. Creating a subclass of `nn.Module`

### Method 1: Direct Computation

```python
# Example: A weighted MSE loss
def weighted_mse_loss(pred, target, weight=2.0):
    return torch.mean(weight * (pred - target) ** 2)

# Use the custom loss
predictions = torch.randn(3, 5)
targets = torch.randn(3, 5)

loss = weighted_mse_loss(predictions, targets)
print(f"Custom Weighted MSE Loss: {loss.item()}")
```

Output:
```
Custom Weighted MSE Loss: 3.1265437602996826
```

### Method 2: Creating a Loss Class

```python
# Creating a custom loss function as a module
class WeightedMSELoss(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, weight=2.0):
        super(WeightedMSELoss, self).__init__()
        self.weight = weight
        
    def forward(self, pred, target):
        return torch.mean(self.weight * (pred - target) ** 2)

# Use the custom loss class
predictions = torch.randn(3, 5)
targets = torch.randn(3, 5)

criterion = WeightedMSELoss(weight=3.0)
loss = criterion(predictions, targets)
print(f"Class-based Custom Weighted MSE Loss: {loss.item()}")
```

Output:
```
Class-based Custom Weighted MSE Loss: 4.587297916412354
```

## Integrating Loss Computation in a Training Loop

Now that we understand loss functions, let's see how they fit into a complete training loop:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

# Define a simple model
class SimpleModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SimpleModel, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(10, 5)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(5, 1)
        self.relu = nn.ReLU()
        
    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.relu(self.fc1(x))
        x = self.fc2(x)
        return x

# Create model, loss function, and optimizer
model = SimpleModel()
criterion = nn.MSELoss()
optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)

# Generate some fake data
X_train = torch.randn(100, 10)
y_train = torch.randn(100, 1)

# Training loop
num_epochs = 5
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    # Forward pass
    outputs = model(X_train)
    
    # Compute loss
    loss = criterion(outputs, y_train)
    
    # Backward and optimize
    optimizer.zero_grad()  # Clear previous gradients
    loss.backward()        # Compute gradients
    optimizer.step()       # Update parameters
    
    # Print progress
    if (epoch + 1) % 1 == 0:
        print(f'Epoch [{epoch+1}/{num_epochs}], Loss: {loss.item():.4f}')
```

Output:
```
Epoch [1/5], Loss: 1.4812
Epoch [2/5], Loss: 1.3542
Epoch [3/5], Loss: 1.2437
Epoch [4/5], Loss: 1.1465
Epoch [5/5], Loss: 1.0606
```

## Practical Example: Image Classification with MNIST

Let's implement a more practical example using the MNIST dataset for image classification:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
import torchvision
import torchvision.transforms as transforms
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader

# Device configuration
device = torch.device('cuda' if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'cpu')

# Hyperparameters
input_size = 784  # 28x28
hidden_size = 500
num_classes = 10
num_epochs = 2
batch_size = 100
learning_rate = 0.001

# MNIST dataset (only load a small subset for demonstration)
train_dataset = torchvision.datasets.MNIST(
    root='./data', 
    train=True,
    transform=transforms.ToTensor(),
    download=True
)

# Take just 1000 samples for quick demonstration
train_dataset = torch.utils.data.Subset(train_dataset, range(1000))

train_loader = DataLoader(
    dataset=train_dataset, 
    batch_size=batch_size, 
    shuffle=True
)

# Neural Network Model
class NeuralNet(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, num_classes):
        super(NeuralNet, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(input_size, hidden_size) 
        self.relu = nn.ReLU()
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(hidden_size, num_classes)  
    
    def forward(self, x):
        out = self.fc1(x)
        out = self.relu(out)
        out = self.fc2(out)
        return out

model = NeuralNet(input_size, hidden_size, num_classes).to(device)

# Loss and optimizer
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=learning_rate)  

# Training loop
total_step = len(train_loader)
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    for i, (images, labels) in enumerate(train_loader):
        # Reshape images to (batch_size, input_size)
        images = images.reshape(-1, input_size).to(device)
        labels = labels.to(device)
        
        # Forward pass
        outputs = model(images)
        
        # Compute loss
        loss = criterion(outputs, labels)
        
        # Backward and optimize
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
        
        # Print progress
        if (i+1) % 5 == 0:
            print(f'Epoch [{epoch+1}/{num_epochs}], Step [{i+1}/{total_step}], Loss: {loss.item():.4f}')
```

Output:
```
Epoch [1/2], Step [5/10], Loss: 1.8934
Epoch [1/2], Step [10/10], Loss: 1.7456
Epoch [2/2], Step [5/10], Loss: 1.5321
Epoch [2/2], Step [10/10], Loss: 1.3890
```

## Handling Class Imbalance with Weighted Loss

In real-world problems, we often encounter imbalanced datasets where some classes have many more samples than others. PyTorch allows you to specify weights for different classes:

```python
# Example of using weighted CrossEntropyLoss
# Class weights (giving more importance to under-represented classes)
class_weights = torch.tensor([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])

# Create weighted loss function
weighted_criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss(weight=class_weights)

# Example data
logits = torch.randn(5, 3)  # 5 samples, 3 classes
targets = torch.randint(0, 3, (5,))  # Random targets between 0-2

# Compute weighted loss
weighted_loss = weighted_criterion(logits, targets)
print(f"Weighted Cross-Entropy Loss: {weighted_loss.item()}")
```

Output:
```
Weighted Cross-Entropy Loss: 2.3576798439025879
```

## Loss Visualization in Training

Visualizing loss over time can provide insights into your model's learning process:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

# Simulate a training process
epochs = 100
train_losses = []
val_losses = []

# Generate some mock loss values
for i in range(epochs):
    train_losses.append(np.exp(-0.05 * i) + 0.2 + 0.1 * np.random.random())
    val_losses.append(np.exp(-0.03 * i) + 0.4 + 0.1 * np.random.random())

# Plotting
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 5))
plt.plot(range(epochs), train_losses, label='Training Loss')
plt.plot(range(epochs), val_losses, label='Validation Loss')
plt.xlabel('Epoch')
plt.ylabel('Loss')
plt.title('Training and Validation Loss Over Time')
plt.legend()
plt.grid(True)
# plt.show()  # Uncomment in your local environment to display the plot
```
