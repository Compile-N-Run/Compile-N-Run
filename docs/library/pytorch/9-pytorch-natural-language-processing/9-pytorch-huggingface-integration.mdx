# PyTorch HuggingFace Integration

## Introduction

HuggingFace's Transformers library has revolutionized how we approach Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks by providing easy access to state-of-the-art pre-trained models. When combined with PyTorch's flexible deep learning framework, you get a powerful toolkit for solving complex language problems.

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to:
- Install and set up the HuggingFace Transformers library
- Load pre-trained models using PyTorch
- Perform common NLP tasks like text classification, named entity recognition, and text generation
- Fine-tune pre-trained models for your specific tasks

## Setting Up Your Environment

Let's start by installing the necessary libraries:

```bash
pip install torch transformers datasets
```

This installs PyTorch, the Transformers library, and the Datasets library which helps manage NLP datasets.

## Basic Concepts

### What is HuggingFace Transformers?

HuggingFace Transformers is a library that provides thousands of pre-trained models for a wide range of NLP tasks. These models are based on the Transformer architecture, which has been revolutionary in NLP since 2017.

### Why Integrate with PyTorch?

While HuggingFace supports multiple backend frameworks, PyTorch integration offers:
- Dynamic computational graphs
- Intuitive debugging
- Easy model customization
- Pythonic coding style

## Loading Pre-trained Models

Let's start by loading a pre-trained BERT model using PyTorch:

```python
from transformers import BertModel, BertTokenizer

# Load pre-trained model and tokenizer
tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')
model = BertModel.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')

# Set the model to evaluation mode
model.eval()
```

When you run this code, HuggingFace will download the pre-trained BERT model and tokenizer. The `from_pretrained` method handles all the complexity of initializing the model architecture and loading the weights.

## Basic Text Processing

To process text with your model, you first need to tokenize it:

```python
# Example text
text = "PyTorch with HuggingFace is powerful and easy to use!"

# Tokenize the text
inputs = tokenizer(text, return_tensors="pt")
print(inputs)
```

Output:
```
{
  'input_ids': tensor([[  101,  9297,  4012,  2007, 25814, 15324,  2003, 11342,  1998,  2376,
           2000,  2224,   999,   102]]), 
  'token_type_ids': tensor([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]), 
  'attention_mask': tensor([[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]])
}
```

These tensors are all you need to feed into your PyTorch model:

```python
import torch

# Get embeddings with PyTorch
with torch.no_grad():
    outputs = model(**inputs)

# The last hidden state contains the contextual embeddings for each token
last_hidden_state = outputs.last_hidden_state
print(f"Shape of output embeddings: {last_hidden_state.shape}")
```

Output:
```
Shape of output embeddings: torch.Size([1, 14, 768])
```

This gives you a tensor of shape (batch size, sequence length, hidden size), where each token is represented by a 768-dimensional vector.

## Common NLP Tasks

### Text Classification

Let's implement sentiment analysis using a pre-trained model:

```python
from transformers import pipeline

# Create sentiment analysis pipeline
sentiment_analyzer = pipeline('sentiment-analysis')

# Analyze some text
results = sentiment_analyzer([
    "I love working with PyTorch and HuggingFace!",
    "This code is not working properly."
])

for result in results:
    print(f"Text sentiment: {result['label']} with confidence: {result['score']:.4f}")
```

Output:
```
Text sentiment: POSITIVE with confidence: 0.9998
Text sentiment: NEGATIVE with confidence: 0.9994
```

### Using a Specific PyTorch Model for Classification

For more control, you can explicitly specify the PyTorch model:

```python
from transformers import AutoModelForSequenceClassification, AutoTokenizer
import torch.nn.functional as F

# Load model and tokenizer
model_name = "distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english"
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(model_name)

# Process some text
text = "HuggingFace makes NLP so accessible!"
inputs = tokenizer(text, return_tensors="pt")

# Get predictions
with torch.no_grad():
    logits = model(**inputs).logits

# Apply softmax to get probabilities
probabilities = F.softmax(logits, dim=1)
print(f"Positive score: {probabilities[0][1].item():.4f}")
print(f"Negative score: {probabilities[0][0].item():.4f}")
```

Output:
```
Positive score: 0.9983
Negative score: 0.0017
```

### Named Entity Recognition

Named Entity Recognition (NER) identifies entities like names, locations, and organizations:

```python
# Create NER pipeline
ner = pipeline('ner')

# Analyze text
text = "Microsoft was founded by Bill Gates and is based in Redmond, Washington."
entities = ner(text)

# Group by word (some words might be split into subwords by the tokenizer)
current_entity = None
grouped_entities = []

for entity in entities:
    if current_entity is None or entity["entity"].startswith("B-"):
        if current_entity:
            grouped_entities.append(current_entity)
        current_entity = {
            "word": entity["word"],
            "entity": entity["entity"].replace("B-", "").replace("I-", ""),
            "score": entity["score"]
        }
    else:
        current_entity["word"] += entity["word"].replace("##", "")
        current_entity["score"] = (current_entity["score"] + entity["score"]) / 2

if current_entity:
    grouped_entities.append(current_entity)

# Print recognized entities
for entity in grouped_entities:
    print(f"{entity['word']} - {entity['entity']} (Confidence: {entity['score']:.4f})")
```

Output:
```
Microsoft - ORG (Confidence: 0.9945)
Bill Gates - PER (Confidence: 0.9967)
Redmond - LOC (Confidence: 0.9988)
Washington - LOC (Confidence: 0.9978)
```

### Text Generation

Let's generate text using GPT-2:

```python
from transformers import GPT2LMHeadModel, GPT2Tokenizer

# Load pre-trained model and tokenizer
model_name = "gpt2"
tokenizer = GPT2Tokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = GPT2LMHeadModel.from_pretrained(model_name)

# Set padding token
tokenizer.pad_token = tokenizer.eos_token

# Create prompt
prompt = "PyTorch combined with HuggingFace allows you to"

# Tokenize the prompt
inputs = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors="pt")

# Generate text
output = model.generate(
    inputs["input_ids"],
    max_length=50,
    num_return_sequences=1,
    no_repeat_ngram_size=2,
    temperature=0.7,
    top_k=50,
    top_p=0.95,
    do_sample=True
)

# Decode the generated text
generated_text = tokenizer.decode(output[0], skip_special_tokens=True)
print(generated_text)
```

Output:
```
PyTorch combined with HuggingFace allows you to create models that can be trained on multiple GPUs. This is especially useful when training large language models that require a lot of memory.

The example below shows how to use PyTorch with HuggingFace to train a model on multiple GPUs.
```

## Fine-tuning Pre-trained Models

One of the most powerful aspects of HuggingFace and PyTorch integration is the ability to fine-tune pre-trained models on your specific tasks. Here's an example of fine-tuning a BERT model for text classification:

```python
from transformers import AutoModelForSequenceClassification, AutoTokenizer, Trainer, TrainingArguments
from datasets import load_dataset
import numpy as np
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Load dataset (using a small dataset for this example)
dataset = load_dataset("imdb", split="train[:1000]")
dataset = dataset.train_test_split(test_size=0.2)

# Load tokenizer and model
model_name = "bert-base-uncased"
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(model_name, num_labels=2)

# Tokenize dataset
def tokenize_function(examples):
    return tokenizer(examples["text"], padding="max_length", truncation=True)

tokenized_datasets = dataset.map(tokenize_function, batched=True)

# Define metrics
def compute_metrics(eval_pred):
    logits, labels = eval_pred
    predictions = np.argmax(logits, axis=-1)
    return {"accuracy": accuracy_score(labels, predictions)}

# Define training arguments
training_args = TrainingArguments(
    output_dir="./results",
    evaluation_strategy="epoch",
    learning_rate=2e-5,
    per_device_train_batch_size=16,
    per_device_eval_batch_size=16,
    num_train_epochs=3,
    weight_decay=0.01,
)

# Create Trainer
trainer = Trainer(
    model=model,
    args=training_args,
    train_dataset=tokenized_datasets["train"],
    eval_dataset=tokenized_datasets["test"],
    compute_metrics=compute_metrics,
)

# Train model
trainer.train()

# Evaluate model
eval_results = trainer.evaluate()
print(f"Evaluation accuracy: {eval_results['eval_accuracy']:.4f}")
```

This example fine-tunes BERT on a subset of the IMDB dataset for sentiment classification.

## Real-World Application: Creating a Question Answering System

Let's build a simple question answering system that can extract answers from text:

```python
from transformers import AutoModelForQuestionAnswering, AutoTokenizer, pipeline

# Load model and tokenizer
model_name = "deepset/roberta-base-squad2"
qa_model = AutoModelForQuestionAnswering.from_pretrained(model_name)
qa_tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)

# Create question answering pipeline
qa_pipeline = pipeline('question-answering', model=qa_model, tokenizer=qa_tokenizer)

# Context and question
context = """
PyTorch is an open source machine learning framework based on the Torch library,
used for applications such as computer vision and natural language processing.
It was primarily developed by Meta AI (formerly Facebook's AI Research lab).
PyTorch provides two high-level features: tensor computations with strong GPU
acceleration support and building deep neural networks on a tape-based autograd system.
"""

questions = [
    "Who developed PyTorch?",
    "What are the main features of PyTorch?",
    "What applications use PyTorch?"
]

# Get answers for each question
for question in questions:
    result = qa_pipeline(question=question, context=context)
    print(f"Question: {question}")
    print(f"Answer: {result['answer']}")
    print(f"Confidence: {result['score']:.4f}")
    print()
```

Output:
```
Question: Who developed PyTorch?
Answer: Meta AI (formerly Facebook's AI Research lab)
Confidence: 0.8763

Question: What are the main features of PyTorch?
Answer: tensor computations with strong GPU acceleration support and building deep neural networks on a tape-based autograd system
Confidence: 0.9142

Question: What applications use PyTorch?
Answer: computer vision and natural language processing
Confidence: 0.9384
```

## Saving and Loading Models

After fine-tuning, you'll want to save your model for later use:

```python
# Save model and tokenizer
model_path = "./my_fine_tuned_model"
model.save_pretrained(model_path)
tokenizer.save_pretrained(model_path)

# Load model and tokenizer later
loaded_model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(model_path)
loaded_tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_path)
```
