# PyTorch GRU Models

## Introduction

Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) are a type of recurrent neural network architecture that has gained popularity for sequential data processing tasks, particularly in Natural Language Processing (NLP). Introduced by Cho et al. in 2014, GRUs are designed to solve the vanishing gradient problem that traditional RNNs face when dealing with long sequences.

In this tutorial, we'll dive into:
- What GRUs are and how they work
- How GRUs compare to LSTMs and vanilla RNNs
- Implementing GRU models in PyTorch
- Building practical NLP applications using GRUs

By the end of this guide, you'll have a solid understanding of GRU models and be able to implement them for your own NLP tasks.

## Understanding Gated Recurrent Units

### The Basics of GRUs

GRUs are designed to capture dependencies of different time scales adaptively. Unlike vanilla RNNs, which can struggle with longer sequences, GRUs use update and reset gates to control the flow of information.

Here's a simplified diagram of a GRU cell:

1. **Update Gate (z)**: Decides how much of the previous memory to keep
2. **Reset Gate (r)**: Determines how to combine new input with previous memory
3. **Current Memory Content (h̃)**: Candidate activation
4. **Final Memory (h)**: Combination of previous memory and new content

The mathematical representation of GRUs can be expressed as:

```
z_t = σ(W_z·[h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_z)
r_t = σ(W_r·[h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_r)
h̃_t = tanh(W·[r_t * h_{t-1}, x_t] + b)
h_t = (1 - z_t) * h_{t-1} + z_t * h̃_t
```

Where:
- σ represents the sigmoid function
- * denotes element-wise multiplication
- [a, b] is the concatenation of vectors a and b

### GRU vs LSTM vs RNN

Let's compare GRUs with other recurrent architectures:

| Feature | Vanilla RNN | LSTM | GRU |
|---------|-------------|------|-----|
| Gates | None | Input, Output, Forget | Update, Reset |
| Memory cells | No | Yes | No |
| Parameters | Fewer | More | Medium |
| Training speed | Faster | Slower | Medium |
| Long-term dependencies | Poor | Good | Good |
| Computational efficiency | High | Lower | Medium |

GRUs strike a good balance between expressiveness and computational efficiency, making them a popular choice for many NLP tasks.

## Implementing GRU Models in PyTorch

### Basic GRU Layer

PyTorch provides a built-in `nn.GRU` module that makes it easy to implement GRU networks. Here's a simple example:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

# Hyperparameters
input_size = 10  # Size of input features
hidden_size = 20  # Size of hidden state
num_layers = 2   # Number of GRU layers
batch_size = 3   # Number of sequences in a batch
seq_length = 5   # Length of each sequence

# Create a random input tensor [seq_length, batch_size, input_size]
input_tensor = torch.randn(seq_length, batch_size, input_size)

# Create a GRU layer
gru_layer = nn.GRU(input_size=input_size,
                   hidden_size=hidden_size,
                   num_layers=num_layers,
                   batch_first=False)  # seq_length comes first in input_tensor

# Initialize hidden state [num_layers, batch_size, hidden_size]
h0 = torch.zeros(num_layers, batch_size, hidden_size)

# Forward pass
output, hn = gru_layer(input_tensor, h0)

print(f"Input shape: {input_tensor.shape}")
print(f"Output shape: {output.shape}")  # Should be [seq_length, batch_size, hidden_size]
print(f"Hidden state shape: {hn.shape}")  # Should be [num_layers, batch_size, hidden_size]
```

Expected output:
```
Input shape: torch.Size([5, 3, 10])
Output shape: torch.Size([5, 3, 20])
Hidden state shape: torch.Size([2, 3, 20])
```

### Creating a Complete GRU Model

Let's build a complete PyTorch model using GRU for a text classification task:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F

class GRUTextClassifier(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, vocab_size, embedding_dim, hidden_size, output_size, num_layers, dropout=0.2):
        super(GRUTextClassifier, self).__init__()
        
        # Embedding layer to convert word indices to vectors
        self.embedding = nn.Embedding(vocab_size, embedding_dim)
        
        # GRU layer
        self.gru = nn.GRU(embedding_dim, 
                          hidden_size, 
                          num_layers=num_layers, 
                          batch_first=True, 
                          dropout=dropout if num_layers > 1 else 0)
        
        # Dropout for regularization
        self.dropout = nn.Dropout(dropout)
        
        # Fully connected layer for classification
        self.fc = nn.Linear(hidden_size, output_size)
        
    def forward(self, text, hidden=None):
        # text shape: [batch_size, seq_length]
        
        # Get embeddings for the whole sequence
        embedded = self.embedding(text)  # [batch_size, seq_length, embedding_dim]
        
        # Pass through GRU
        if hidden is None:
            batch_size = text.size(0)
            hidden = self._init_hidden(batch_size)
            
        output, hidden = self.gru(embedded, hidden)  
        # output shape: [batch_size, seq_length, hidden_size]
        # hidden shape: [num_layers, batch_size, hidden_size]
        
        # We'll use the final hidden state for classification
        hidden_final = hidden[-1, :, :]  # [batch_size, hidden_size]
        
        # Apply dropout
        out = self.dropout(hidden_final)
        
        # Apply classification layer
        out = self.fc(out)  # [batch_size, output_size]
        
        return out, hidden
    
    def _init_hidden(self, batch_size):
        # Initialize hidden state with zeros
        device = next(self.parameters()).device
        return torch.zeros(self.gru.num_layers, batch_size, self.gru.hidden_size).to(device)
```

## Practical Example: Sentiment Analysis with GRU

Let's build a sentiment analysis model using a GRU. We'll use a subset of the IMDB movie reviews dataset.

### Step 1: Preparing the Data

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
from torch.utils.data import Dataset, DataLoader
from torchtext.vocab import build_vocab_from_iterator
import re
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Sample data (in a real scenario, you'd load from a file)
texts = [
    "This movie was excellent, I loved it!",
    "The acting was terrible, what a waste of time.",
    "Great plot, amazing characters, highly recommended!",
    "I fell asleep during this boring film.",
    # Add more examples...
]
labels = [1, 0, 1, 0]  # 1: positive, 0: negative

# Preprocess text
def preprocess_text(text):
    # Convert to lowercase and remove special characters
    text = re.sub(r'[^\w\s]', '', text.lower())
    return text.split()

# Preprocess all texts
preprocessed_texts = [preprocess_text(text) for text in texts]

# Build vocabulary
def yield_tokens(data_iter):
    for text in data_iter:
        yield text

vocab = build_vocab_from_iterator(yield_tokens(preprocessed_texts), specials=["<unk>"])
vocab.set_default_index(vocab["<unk>"])

# Create numerical representations
def text_to_indices(text, max_length=100):
    indices = [vocab[token] for token in text]
    # Pad or truncate to fixed length
    if len(indices) < max_length:
        indices = indices + [vocab["<unk>"]] * (max_length - len(indices))
    else:
        indices = indices[:max_length]
    return indices

# Convert all texts to indices
indexed_texts = [text_to_indices(text) for text in preprocessed_texts]

# Create PyTorch tensors
X = torch.tensor(indexed_texts, dtype=torch.long)
y = torch.tensor(labels, dtype=torch.long)

# Split into training and validation sets
X_train, X_val, y_train, y_val = train_test_split(
    X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42
)

# Create DataLoader
class TextDataset(Dataset):
    def __init__(self, texts, labels):
        self.texts = texts
        self.labels = labels

    def __len__(self):
        return len(self.labels)

    def __getitem__(self, idx):
        return self.texts[idx], self.labels[idx]

train_dataset = TextDataset(X_train, y_train)
val_dataset = TextDataset(X_val, y_val)

train_loader = DataLoader(train_dataset, batch_size=2, shuffle=True)
val_loader = DataLoader(val_dataset, batch_size=2)
```

### Step 2: Building and Training the Model

```python
# Model parameters
vocab_size = len(vocab)
embedding_dim = 100
hidden_size = 128
output_size = 2  # Binary classification (positive/negative)
num_layers = 2
learning_rate = 0.001
epochs = 10

# Initialize model, loss function, and optimizer
model = GRUTextClassifier(vocab_size, embedding_dim, hidden_size, output_size, num_layers)
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=learning_rate)

# Training loop
for epoch in range(epochs):
    model.train()
    total_loss = 0
    
    for texts, labels in train_loader:
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        
        # Forward pass
        predictions, _ = model(texts)
        
        # Calculate loss
        loss = criterion(predictions, labels)
        total_loss += loss.item()
        
        # Backpropagation
        loss.backward()
        
        # Update parameters
        optimizer.step()
    
    # Validation
    model.eval()
    correct = 0
    total = 0
    
    with torch.no_grad():
        for texts, labels in val_loader:
            outputs, _ = model(texts)
            _, predicted = torch.max(outputs.data, 1)
            total += labels.size(0)
            correct += (predicted == labels).sum().item()
    
    print(f'Epoch: {epoch+1}, Loss: {total_loss:.4f}, Accuracy: {100 * correct / total:.2f}%')
```

### Step 3: Using the Model for Prediction

```python
def predict_sentiment(text, model, vocab):
    model.eval()
    
    # Preprocess the text
    preprocessed = preprocess_text(text)
    indices = text_to_indices(preprocessed)
    
    # Convert to tensor and add batch dimension
    tensor = torch.tensor([indices], dtype=torch.long)
    
    # Get prediction
    with torch.no_grad():
        output, _ = model(tensor)
        _, predicted = torch.max(output, 1)
    
    sentiment = "Positive" if predicted.item() == 1 else "Negative"
    return sentiment

# Example usage
new_review = "I really enjoyed the movie, the actors did a fantastic job."
sentiment = predict_sentiment(new_review, model, vocab)
print(f"Review: {new_review}")
print(f"Predicted sentiment: {sentiment}")
```

## Advanced GRU Techniques

### Bidirectional GRUs

Bidirectional GRUs process the input sequence in both forward and backward directions, capturing dependencies from both past and future states:

```python
class BiGRUTextClassifier(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, vocab_size, embedding_dim, hidden_size, output_size, num_layers, dropout=0.2):
        super(BiGRUTextClassifier, self).__init__()
        
        self.embedding = nn.Embedding(vocab_size, embedding_dim)
        
        # Bidirectional GRU
        self.gru = nn.GRU(embedding_dim, 
                          hidden_size, 
                          num_layers=num_layers, 
                          batch_first=True, 
                          bidirectional=True,  # Enable bidirectional
                          dropout=dropout if num_layers > 1 else 0)
        
        self.dropout = nn.Dropout(dropout)
        
        # The output of bidirectional GRU has twice the hidden size
        self.fc = nn.Linear(hidden_size * 2, output_size)
        
    def forward(self, text):
        embedded = self.embedding(text)
        
        # No need to initialize hidden state, defaults to zeros
        output, hidden = self.gru(embedded)
        
        # Concatenate the final forward and backward hidden states
        hidden_forward = hidden[-2, :, :]  # Last layer's forward direction
        hidden_backward = hidden[-1, :, :]  # Last layer's backward direction
        hidden_cat = torch.cat((hidden_forward, hidden_backward), dim=1)
        
        out = self.dropout(hidden_cat)
        out = self.fc(out)
        
        return out
```

### Attention Mechanism with GRU

Adding an attention mechanism can help the model focus on important parts of the input sequence:

```python
class AttentionGRU(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, vocab_size, embedding_dim, hidden_size, output_size, num_layers, dropout=0.2):
        super(AttentionGRU, self).__init__()
        
        self.hidden_size = hidden_size
        self.embedding = nn.Embedding(vocab_size, embedding_dim)
        self.gru = nn.GRU(embedding_dim, hidden_size, num_layers=num_layers, 
                          batch_first=True, dropout=dropout if num_layers > 1 else 0)
        
        # Attention layers
        self.attention = nn.Linear(hidden_size, hidden_size)
        self.attention_combine = nn.Linear(hidden_size, 1)
        
        self.dropout = nn.Dropout(dropout)
        self.fc = nn.Linear(hidden_size, output_size)
        
    def forward(self, text):
        embedded = self.embedding(text)
        
        # GRU output for the entire sequence
        gru_output, hidden = self.gru(embedded)
        # gru_output shape: [batch_size, seq_len, hidden_size]
        
        # Calculate attention weights
        energy = torch.tanh(self.attention(gru_output))
        attention_weights = F.softmax(self.attention_combine(energy), dim=1)
        # attention_weights shape: [batch_size, seq_len, 1]
        
        # Apply attention weights to GRU outputs
        context = torch.sum(gru_output * attention_weights, dim=1)
        # context shape: [batch_size, hidden_size]
        
        out = self.dropout(context)
        out = self.fc(out)
        
        return out, attention_weights
```

## Real-World Applications of GRUs
