# PyTorch TensorBoard Integration

## Introduction

Debugging and visualizing deep learning models can be challenging due to their complexity and the large amounts of data involved. TensorBoard is a powerful visualization tool that was originally developed for TensorFlow but can now be seamlessly integrated with PyTorch through the `torch.utils.tensorboard` module. This integration allows you to track and visualize metrics like loss and accuracy, inspect model architecture, view feature maps, and much more.

In this tutorial, we'll explore how to integrate TensorBoard with your PyTorch projects to gain deeper insights into your models during training and debugging.

## Why Use TensorBoard with PyTorch?

TensorBoard provides several benefits for PyTorch users:

- **Real-time visualization**: Monitor training metrics as your model trains
- **Model architecture visualization**: Visualize your model's computational graph
- **Hyperparameter tracking**: Compare performance across different hyperparameter choices
- **Image, audio, and text visualization**: Visualize inputs, predictions, and intermediate activations
- **Embedding visualization**: Explore high-dimensional data in a 2D or 3D space

## Setting Up TensorBoard with PyTorch

### Prerequisites

First, we need to install the necessary packages:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision tensorboard
```

### Basic Integration

Let's start with a simple example of how to log scalars (like loss and accuracy) to TensorBoard:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader
from torchvision import datasets, transforms
from torch.utils.tensorboard import SummaryWriter

# Set up the SummaryWriter
writer = SummaryWriter('runs/mnist_experiment')

# Define a simple model
class SimpleModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SimpleModel, self).__init__()
        self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(1, 32, 3, 1)
        self.conv2 = nn.Conv2d(32, 64, 3, 1)
        self.dropout1 = nn.Dropout(0.25)
        self.dropout2 = nn.Dropout(0.5)
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(9216, 128)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(128, 10)
        
    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.conv1(x)
        x = nn.functional.relu(x)
        x = self.conv2(x)
        x = nn.functional.relu(x)
        x = nn.functional.max_pool2d(x, 2)
        x = self.dropout1(x)
        x = torch.flatten(x, 1)
        x = self.fc1(x)
        x = nn.functional.relu(x)
        x = self.dropout2(x)
        x = self.fc2(x)
        return x

# Load data
transform = transforms.Compose([
    transforms.ToTensor(),
    transforms.Normalize((0.1307,), (0.3081,))
])

train_dataset = datasets.MNIST('data', train=True, download=True, transform=transform)
test_dataset = datasets.MNIST('data', train=False, transform=transform)

train_loader = DataLoader(train_dataset, batch_size=64, shuffle=True)
test_loader = DataLoader(test_dataset, batch_size=1000)

# Initialize model and optimizer
model = SimpleModel()
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()

# Training loop with TensorBoard logging
def train(epochs):
    for epoch in range(epochs):
        model.train()
        running_loss = 0.0
        correct = 0
        total = 0
        
        for batch_idx, (data, target) in enumerate(train_loader):
            optimizer.zero_grad()
            output = model(data)
            loss = criterion(output, target)
            loss.backward()
            optimizer.step()
            
            # Update statistics
            running_loss += loss.item()
            _, predicted = torch.max(output.data, 1)
            total += target.size(0)
            correct += (predicted == target).sum().item()
            
            if batch_idx % 100 == 99:  # Log every 100 batches
                # Log loss
                writer.add_scalar('training loss', 
                                 running_loss / 100,
                                 epoch * len(train_loader) + batch_idx)
                
                # Log accuracy
                accuracy = 100.0 * correct / total
                writer.add_scalar('training accuracy', 
                                 accuracy,
                                 epoch * len(train_loader) + batch_idx)
                
                running_loss = 0.0
                correct = 0
                total = 0
        
        # Evaluate at the end of each epoch
        evaluate(epoch)
    
    writer.close()

# Evaluation function
def evaluate(epoch):
    model.eval()
    test_loss = 0
    correct = 0
    with torch.no_grad():
        for data, target in test_loader:
            output = model(data)
            test_loss += criterion(output, target).item()
            pred = output.argmax(dim=1, keepdim=True)
            correct += pred.eq(target.view_as(pred)).sum().item()

    test_loss /= len(test_loader.dataset)
    accuracy = 100. * correct / len(test_loader.dataset)
    
    # Log test metrics
    writer.add_scalar('test loss', test_loss, epoch)
    writer.add_scalar('test accuracy', accuracy, epoch)

# Train for 5 epochs
train(5)
```

After running this code, you can launch TensorBoard with:

```bash
tensorboard --logdir=runs
```

## Advanced TensorBoard Features with PyTorch

### Visualizing the Model Graph

You can visualize your model's computational graph in TensorBoard:

```python
# Add model graph to TensorBoard
dummy_input = torch.rand(1, 1, 28, 28)  # Example input for MNIST
writer.add_graph(model, dummy_input)
```

### Visualizing Images

TensorBoard allows you to visualize input images, which is useful for checking data augmentation or intermediate feature maps:

```python
# Get a batch of training images
dataiter = iter(train_loader)
images, labels = next(dataiter)

# Create a grid of images and log it to TensorBoard
img_grid = torchvision.utils.make_grid(images)
writer.add_image('mnist_images', img_grid)
```

### Tracking Hyperparameters

You can track different hyperparameters to compare experiments:

```python
# Log hyperparameters
writer.add_hparams(
    {'lr': 0.001, 'bsize': 64, 'optimizer': 'Adam'},
    {'accuracy': accuracy, 'loss': test_loss}
)
```

### Visualizing Weight Histograms and Distributions

Tracking weights and gradients can help identify issues like vanishing/exploding gradients:

```python
# Log histograms of model parameters
for name, param in model.named_parameters():
    writer.add_histogram(f'param/{name}', param, global_step=epoch)
    if param.grad is not None:
        writer.add_histogram(f'grad/{name}', param.grad, global_step=epoch)
```

### Visualizing Confusion Matrix

For classification tasks, visualizing the confusion matrix can be insightful:

```python
import numpy as np
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix

# Function to generate confusion matrix
def plot_confusion_matrix(true_labels, predicted_labels, epoch):
    cm = confusion_matrix(true_labels, predicted_labels)
    
    # Create a figure
    fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(10, 10))
    sns.heatmap(cm, annot=True, fmt='d', cmap='Blues')
    plt.xlabel('Predicted')
    plt.ylabel('True')
    plt.title('Confusion Matrix')
    
    # Log the figure to TensorBoard
    writer.add_figure('confusion_matrix', fig, global_step=epoch)

# To use this in the evaluation:
def evaluate_with_cm(epoch):
    model.eval()
    all_preds = []
    all_labels = []
    
    with torch.no_grad():
        for data, target in test_loader:
            output = model(data)
            pred = output.argmax(dim=1)
            all_preds.extend(pred.cpu().numpy())
            all_labels.extend(target.cpu().numpy())
    
    # Plot confusion matrix
    plot_confusion_matrix(all_labels, all_preds, epoch)
```

## Debugging with TensorBoard

TensorBoard is especially valuable for debugging neural networks. Here are some common debugging approaches:

### Identifying Overfitting

By plotting training and validation loss curves, you can easily identify overfitting:

```python
# In your training loop:
writer.add_scalars('Loss', {'train': train_loss, 'validation': val_loss}, epoch)
```

### Finding Learning Rate Issues

If your model is learning too slowly or diverging, you might need to adjust the learning rate:

```python
# Log learning rate
for param_group in optimizer.param_groups:
    writer.add_scalar('learning_rate', param_group['lr'], epoch)
```

### Detecting Exploding/Vanishing Gradients

Monitor the gradient histograms to detect any abnormal gradient behavior:

```python
# After backward pass
for name, param in model.named_parameters():
    if param.grad is not None:
        writer.add_histogram(f'grad/{name}', param.grad, global_step=epoch)
        
        # Add additional statistics
        writer.add_scalar(f'grad_mean/{name}', param.grad.mean(), global_step=epoch)
        writer.add_scalar(f'grad_max/{name}', param.grad.abs().max(), global_step=epoch)
```

## Real-world Example: Debugging a Model that Doesn't Converge

Let's say you're training a model that's not converging properly. Here's how you can use TensorBoard to debug the issue:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
from torch.utils.tensorboard import SummaryWriter
import time

# Create a model with potential initialization issues
class ProblematicModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, bad_init=True):
        super(ProblematicModel, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(784, 500)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(500, 10)
        
        # Bad initialization to demonstrate debugging
        if bad_init:
            nn.init.constant_(self.fc1.weight, 0.0)  # Initialize weights to zero
        
    def forward(self, x):
        x = x.view(-1, 784)
        x = torch.relu(self.fc1(x))
        x = self.fc2(x)
        return x

# Create two models for comparison
model_bad = ProblematicModel(bad_init=True)
model_good = ProblematicModel(bad_init=False)

# Set up writers for each model
writer_bad = SummaryWriter('runs/problematic_model')
writer_good = SummaryWriter('runs/good_model')

# Setup data, optimizers, etc.
# ... (similar to previous example)

# Training function with TensorBoard logging
def debug_training(model, writer, model_name, epochs=3):
    optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)
    criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
    
    # Log initial weights
    for name, param in model.named_parameters():
        writer.add_histogram(f'{model_name}/initial_{name}', param, global_step=0)
    
    for epoch in range(epochs):
        model.train()
        for batch_idx, (data, target) in enumerate(train_loader):
            optimizer.zero_grad()
            output = model(data)
            loss = criterion(output, target)
            loss.backward()
            
            # Log gradients before optimizer step
            for name, param in model.named_parameters():
                if param.grad is not None:
                    writer.add_histogram(f'{model_name}/grad_{name}', param.grad, 
                                        global_step=epoch * len(train_loader) + batch_idx)
                    writer.add_scalar(f'{model_name}/grad_mean_{name}', param.grad.mean(), 
                                     global_step=epoch * len(train_loader) + batch_idx)
            
            optimizer.step()
            
            # Log weights after optimizer step
            if batch_idx % 200 == 0:
                for name, param in model.named_parameters():
                    writer.add_histogram(f'{model_name}/param_{name}', param, 
                                        global_step=epoch * len(train_loader) + batch_idx)
            
            # Log loss
            writer.add_scalar(f'{model_name}/loss', loss.item(), 
                             epoch * len(train_loader) + batch_idx)

# Train both models
debug_training(model_bad, writer_bad, 'bad_model')
debug_training(model_good, writer_good, 'good_model')

# Close writers
writer_bad.close()
writer_good.close()
```

By comparing the two models in TensorBoard, you'll see that:

1. The bad model has zero initial weights which leads to zero gradients
2. The good model's weights change properly during training
3. The bad model's loss doesn't decrease significantly

This demonstrates how TensorBoard can help identify initialization issues.

## Tips for Effective TensorBoard Usage

1. **Organize experiments**: Use meaningful names for your SummaryWriter instances to keep track of different experiments.

   ```python
   writer = SummaryWriter(f'runs/experiment_{time.strftime("%Y%m%d-%H%M%S")}')
   ```

2. **Group related metrics**: Use `add_scalars` instead of multiple `add_scalar` calls for related metrics.

   ```python
   writer.add_scalars('accuracy', {'train': train_acc, 'val': val_acc}, epoch)
   ```

3. **Log metadata with images**: Add captions to images for better context.

   ```python
   writer.add_image('prediction', img_grid, global_step=epoch, 
                   dataformats='CHW')
   ```

4. **Use tags efficiently**: Create a hierarchical organization with tags using slashes.

   ```python
   writer.add_scalar('metrics/loss/train', train_loss, epoch)
   writer.add_scalar('metrics/loss/validation', val_loss, epoch)
   ```

5. **Clean up after experiments**: Close your writers when done.

   ```python
   writer.close()
   ```
