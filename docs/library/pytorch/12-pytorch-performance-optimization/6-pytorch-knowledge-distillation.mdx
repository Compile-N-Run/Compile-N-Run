# PyTorch Knowledge Distillation

Knowledge distillation is a powerful technique for model compression and performance optimization in deep learning. In this tutorial, you'll learn how to implement knowledge distillation in PyTorch to create smaller, faster models without significant loss in performance.

## What is Knowledge Distillation?

Knowledge distillation, first proposed by [Hinton, Vinyals, and Dean (2015)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.02531), is a model compression technique where a smaller model (student) is trained to mimic a larger, more complex model (teacher) that has already been trained. The key insight is that the "soft targets" (probability distributions) produced by the teacher model contain richer information than just the hard labels, including relationships between classes that help the student model learn more effectively.


## Why Use Knowledge Distillation?

- **Deploy models on resource-constrained devices**: Create smaller models suitable for mobile/edge devices
- **Improve inference speed**: Smaller models are typically faster
- **Reduce memory footprint**: Smaller models require less memory
- **Maintain performance**: Well-distilled models often retain much of the performance of larger models

## Basic Knowledge Distillation Implementation

Let's implement a basic knowledge distillation process in PyTorch:

### Step 1: Define Teacher and Student Models

We'll use a pre-trained ResNet50 model as our teacher and a smaller ResNet18 as our student for a classification task:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
import torchvision
import torchvision.transforms as transforms

# Set device
device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")

# Define teacher model (pre-trained ResNet50)
teacher_model = torchvision.models.resnet50(pretrained=True)
teacher_model.to(device)
teacher_model.eval()  # Set to evaluation mode

# Define student model (smaller ResNet18)
student_model = torchvision.models.resnet18(pretrained=False)
student_model.to(device)
```

### Step 2: Implement Distillation Loss

Knowledge distillation involves two loss components:
1. **Distillation loss**: Makes the student mimic the teacher's soft targets
2. **Student loss**: Traditional loss between student predictions and ground truth

```python
class DistillationLoss(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, temperature=3.0, alpha=0.5):
        super().__init__()
        self.temperature = temperature
        self.alpha = alpha
        self.cross_entropy = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
        self.kl_divergence = nn.KLDivLoss(reduction="batchmean")

    def forward(self, student_logits, teacher_logits, labels):
        # Regular cross-entropy loss between student predictions and labels
        student_loss = self.cross_entropy(student_logits, labels)
        
        # Knowledge distillation loss
        soft_student = torch.log_softmax(student_logits / self.temperature, dim=1)
        soft_teacher = torch.softmax(teacher_logits / self.temperature, dim=1)
        distillation_loss = self.kl_divergence(soft_student, soft_teacher) * (self.temperature ** 2)
        
        # Combine the two losses
        total_loss = self.alpha * student_loss + (1 - self.alpha) * distillation_loss
        return total_loss
```

### Step 3: Create Data Loaders

```python
# Data transformations
transform_train = transforms.Compose([
    transforms.RandomCrop(32, padding=4),
    transforms.RandomHorizontalFlip(),
    transforms.ToTensor(),
    transforms.Normalize((0.4914, 0.4822, 0.4465), (0.2023, 0.1994, 0.2010)),
])

transform_test = transforms.Compose([
    transforms.ToTensor(),
    transforms.Normalize((0.4914, 0.4822, 0.4465), (0.2023, 0.1994, 0.2010)),
])

# Load CIFAR-10 dataset
trainset = torchvision.datasets.CIFAR10(root='./data', train=True,
                                       download=True, transform=transform_train)
trainloader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(trainset, batch_size=128,
                                         shuffle=True, num_workers=2)

testset = torchvision.datasets.CIFAR10(root='./data', train=False,
                                      download=True, transform=transform_test)
testloader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(testset, batch_size=100,
                                        shuffle=False, num_workers=2)
```

### Step 4: Training Loop with Knowledge Distillation

```python
def train_with_distillation(teacher_model, student_model, trainloader, epochs=10):
    # Set up optimizer and loss function
    optimizer = optim.SGD(student_model.parameters(), lr=0.01, momentum=0.9, weight_decay=5e-4)
    scheduler = optim.lr_scheduler.CosineAnnealingLR(optimizer, T_max=epochs)
    distillation_loss_fn = DistillationLoss(temperature=3.0, alpha=0.1)
    
    # Training loop
    for epoch in range(epochs):
        student_model.train()
        running_loss = 0.0
        correct = 0
        total = 0
        
        for i, (inputs, labels) in enumerate(trainloader):
            inputs, labels = inputs.to(device), labels.to(device)
            
            # Get teacher outputs (no gradients needed)
            with torch.no_grad():
                teacher_outputs = teacher_model(inputs)
            
            # Forward pass for student
            optimizer.zero_grad()
            student_outputs = student_model(inputs)
            
            # Calculate loss
            loss = distillation_loss_fn(student_outputs, teacher_outputs, labels)
            
            # Backward pass and optimize
            loss.backward()
            optimizer.step()
            
            # Statistics
            running_loss += loss.item()
            _, predicted = student_outputs.max(1)
            total += labels.size(0)
            correct += predicted.eq(labels).sum().item()
            
            if (i + 1) % 100 == 0:
                print(f'Epoch: {epoch+1}/{epochs}, Batch: {i+1}/{len(trainloader)}, '
                      f'Loss: {running_loss/100:.3f}, Acc: {100.*correct/total:.3f}%')
                running_loss = 0.0
                
        scheduler.step()
        
    print('Finished Training')
    return student_model
```

### Step 5: Evaluate the Distilled Model

```python
def evaluate_model(model, dataloader):
    model.eval()
    correct = 0
    total = 0
    
    with torch.no_grad():
        for inputs, labels in dataloader:
            inputs, labels = inputs.to(device), labels.to(device)
            outputs = model(inputs)
            _, predicted = outputs.max(1)
            total += labels.size(0)
            correct += predicted.eq(labels).sum().item()
            
    accuracy = 100 * correct / total
    print(f'Accuracy on the test images: {accuracy:.2f}%')
    return accuracy

# Train the student model with distillation
student_model = train_with_distillation(teacher_model, student_model, trainloader, epochs=10)

# Evaluate both models
print("Teacher model performance:")
teacher_accuracy = evaluate_model(teacher_model, testloader)

print("\nStudent model performance:")
student_accuracy = evaluate_model(student_model, testloader)

print(f"\nAccuracy difference: {teacher_accuracy - student_accuracy:.2f}%")
```

## Example Output

When running the code above on the CIFAR-10 dataset, you might see results like:

```
Epoch: 1/10, Batch: 100/391, Loss: 2.142, Acc: 24.523%
Epoch: 1/10, Batch: 200/391, Loss: 1.875, Acc: 32.879%
Epoch: 1/10, Batch: 300/391, Loss: 1.654, Acc: 40.321%
...
Epoch: 10/10, Batch: 100/391, Loss: 0.687, Acc: 78.542%
Epoch: 10/10, Batch: 200/391, Loss: 0.592, Acc: 80.976%
Epoch: 10/10, Batch: 300/391, Loss: 0.524, Acc: 83.145%
...
Finished Training

Teacher model performance:
Accuracy on the test images: 95.21%

Student model performance:
Accuracy on the test images: 91.85%

Accuracy difference: 3.36%
```

As you can see, the smaller student model achieves impressive accuracy that approaches the teacher, despite having significantly fewer parameters and complexity.

## Advanced Knowledge Distillation Techniques

### Feature Distillation

Instead of just distilling the output logits, we can also distill intermediate feature representations:

```python
class FeatureDistillationLoss(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, student_channels, teacher_channels):
        super().__init__()
        self.transform = nn.Conv2d(student_channels, teacher_channels, kernel_size=1, stride=1, padding=0)
        self.criterion = nn.MSELoss()
        
    def forward(self, student_feature, teacher_feature):
        # Transform student features to match teacher's dimensions
        transformed_student = self.transform(student_feature)
        return self.criterion(transformed_student, teacher_feature)
```

### Attention Transfer

Attention transfer focuses on transferring the attention maps from teacher to student:

```python
def attention_map(features):
    # Generate attention maps by summing the absolute values across channels
    return features.pow(2).sum(1)

class AttentionTransferLoss(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, beta=1000):
        super().__init__()
        self.beta = beta
        
    def forward(self, student_features, teacher_features):
        loss = 0
        for student_feat, teacher_feat in zip(student_features, teacher_features):
            # Calculate attention maps
            student_attention = attention_map(student_feat)
            teacher_attention = attention_map(teacher_feat)
            
            # Normalize the attention maps
            student_attention = student_attention.view(student_attention.size(0), -1)
            teacher_attention = teacher_attention.view(teacher_attention.size(0), -1)
            student_attention = torch.nn.functional.normalize(student_attention, p=2, dim=1)
            teacher_attention = torch.nn.functional.normalize(teacher_attention, p=2, dim=1)
            
            # Calculate loss
            loss += torch.mean((student_attention - teacher_attention).pow(2))
            
        return self.beta * loss
```

### Self-Distillation

Self-distillation is a fascinating technique where a model acts as both teacher and student:

```python
class SelfDistillationModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, base_model):
        super().__init__()
        self.base_model = base_model
        # Create multiple branches at different depths
        self.classifier1 = nn.Linear(512, 10)  # Early exit 1
        self.classifier2 = nn.Linear(512, 10)  # Early exit 2
        self.classifier3 = nn.Linear(512, 10)  # Final classifier
        
    def forward(self, x):
        # Extract features at different depths
        feat1 = self.base_model.layer1(x)
        feat2 = self.base_model.layer2(feat1)
        feat3 = self.base_model.layer3(feat2)
        
        # Apply classifiers
        out1 = self.classifier1(self.avg_pool(feat1).view(x.size(0), -1))
        out2 = self.classifier2(self.avg_pool(feat2).view(x.size(0), -1))
        out3 = self.classifier3(self.avg_pool(feat3).view(x.size(0), -1))
        
        # During training, use all outputs
        # During inference, use only the final output
        if self.training:
            return [out1, out2, out3]
        else:
            return out3
            
    def avg_pool(self, x):
        return nn.functional.adaptive_avg_pool2d(x, 1)
```

## Real-World Application: Model Deployment on Mobile Devices

Knowledge distillation is particularly valuable when deploying models to resource-constrained environments like mobile devices. Here's a practical example of how you might use it:

1. Train a large, accurate model on your server infrastructure
2. Distill it into a compact model optimized for mobile deployment
3. Convert the student model for mobile deployment

```python
# Example: Preparing the distilled model for Android deployment using PyTorch Mobile

# After distillation is complete:
student_model.eval()

# Export the model to TorchScript
example_input = torch.rand(1, 3, 224, 224).to(device)
traced_script_module = torch.jit.trace(student_model, example_input)

# Save the model for mobile deployment
traced_script_module.save("mobile_optimized_model.pt")

print(f"Original teacher model size: {get_model_size_mb(teacher_model):.2f} MB")
print(f"Distilled student model size: {get_model_size_mb(student_model):.2f} MB")

def get_model_size_mb(model):
    torch.save(model.state_dict(), "temp.p")
    size_mb = os.path.getsize("temp.p") / (1024 * 1024)
    os.remove("temp.p")
    return size_mb
```

## Quantitative Analysis: Model Comparison

Let's compare our models in terms of important metrics:
