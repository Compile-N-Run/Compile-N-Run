# PyTorch NCCL

## Introduction

When training deep learning models across multiple GPUs, efficient communication becomes a critical factor for performance. **NVIDIA Collective Communications Library (NCCL)** is a specialized library designed for this purpose, offering high-performance multi-GPU communication primitives that work seamlessly with PyTorch's distributed training capabilities.

In this guide, we'll explore:
- What NCCL is and why it matters
- How NCCL integrates with PyTorch
- Setting up NCCL-based distributed training
- Common NCCL operations and patterns
- Troubleshooting and optimization techniques

## What is NCCL?

NCCL (pronounced "nickel") is NVIDIA's library for collective communication routines executed on CUDA-enabled GPUs. The key benefit of NCCL is that it provides optimized implementations of common communication patterns used in deep learning:

- **All-reduce**: Aggregates data across all GPUs and ensures all GPUs have the same result
- **All-gather**: Collects data from all GPUs into a single array visible to all GPUs
- **Reduce-scatter**: Combines data from all GPUs and distributes segments to different GPUs
- **Broadcast**: Shares data from a single GPU to all other GPUs
- **Point-to-point send/receive**: Transfers data between specific GPUs

What makes NCCL special is its optimization for NVIDIA GPU architectures, utilizing:
- Direct GPU-to-GPU communication over NVLink (when available)
- Optimized communication over PCIe
- Efficient network communication using technologies like InfiniBand and RDMA

## Integrating NCCL with PyTorch

PyTorch seamlessly integrates with NCCL through its distributed backend API. When initializing a distributed process group in PyTorch, you can specify NCCL as the backend:

```python
import torch.distributed as dist

# Initialize process group with NCCL backend
dist.init_process_group(backend="nccl")
```

By default, in multi-GPU environments, PyTorch will attempt to use NCCL as the distributed backend, making it the preferred choice when working with NVIDIA GPUs.

## Setting Up NCCL-Based Distributed Training

Let's walk through a step-by-step example of setting up NCCL-based distributed training in PyTorch:

### 1. Basic Setup

```python
import os
import torch
import torch.distributed as dist
import torch.multiprocessing as mp
from torch.nn.parallel import DistributedDataParallel as DDP

def setup(rank, world_size):
    """Initialize the distributed environment."""
    os.environ['MASTER_ADDR'] = 'localhost'
    os.environ['MASTER_PORT'] = '12355'
    
    # Initialize the process group with NCCL backend
    dist.init_process_group("nccl", rank=rank, world_size=world_size)
    
    # Set device for this process
    torch.cuda.set_device(rank)

def cleanup():
    """Clean up the distributed environment."""
    dist.destroy_process_group()
```

### 2. Training Function

```python
def train(rank, world_size):
    # Setup the process group
    setup(rank, world_size)
    
    # Create model and move it to the GPU
    model = torch.nn.Linear(10, 10).to(rank)
    
    # Wrap the model with DDP
    ddp_model = DDP(model, device_ids=[rank])
    
    # Create optimizer
    optimizer = torch.optim.SGD(ddp_model.parameters(), lr=0.001)
    
    # Training loop
    for epoch in range(10):
        # Create dummy data
        inputs = torch.randn(20, 10).to(rank)
        targets = torch.randn(20, 10).to(rank)
        
        # Forward pass
        outputs = ddp_model(inputs)
        loss = torch.nn.functional.mse_loss(outputs, targets)
        
        # Backward pass
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
        
        # Print progress
        if rank == 0 and epoch % 2 == 0:
            print(f"Epoch {epoch}, Loss: {loss.item()}")
    
    # Cleanup
    cleanup()
```

### 3. Launch Training

```python
def main():
    # Number of GPUs available
    world_size = torch.cuda.device_count()
    print(f"Using {world_size} GPUs for training")
    
    # Spawn processes
    mp.spawn(train, args=(world_size,), nprocs=world_size, join=True)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Using 4 GPUs for training
Epoch 0, Loss: 1.0234
Epoch 2, Loss: 0.7845
Epoch 4, Loss: 0.4563
Epoch 6, Loss: 0.2345
Epoch 8, Loss: 0.1243
```

## Common NCCL Operations in PyTorch

NCCL powers several key collective operations in PyTorch's distributed framework. Here are some of the most commonly used operations:

### All-Reduce

The all-reduce operation aggregates values from all GPUs and distributes the results back to all GPUs.

```python
# All-reduce operation
def all_reduce_example(rank, world_size):
    setup(rank, world_size)
    
    # Create tensor on current GPU
    tensor = torch.ones(10) * (rank + 1)
    tensor = tensor.to(rank)
    
    print(f"Rank {rank} before all-reduce: {tensor[0].item()}")
    
    # Perform all-reduce (sum operation)
    dist.all_reduce(tensor, op=dist.ReduceOp.SUM)
    
    print(f"Rank {rank} after all-reduce: {tensor[0].item()}")
    
    cleanup()
```

**Expected Output (with 4 GPUs):**
```
Rank 0 before all-reduce: 1.0
Rank 1 before all-reduce: 2.0
Rank 2 before all-reduce: 3.0
Rank 3 before all-reduce: 4.0
Rank 0 after all-reduce: 10.0
Rank 1 after all-reduce: 10.0
Rank 2 after all-reduce: 10.0
Rank 3 after all-reduce: 10.0
```

### Broadcast

The broadcast operation sends a tensor from a specified source rank to all other processes.

```python
# Broadcast operation
def broadcast_example(rank, world_size):
    setup(rank, world_size)
    
    # Create tensor only on rank 0
    if rank == 0:
        tensor = torch.tensor([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], device=rank)
    else:
        tensor = torch.zeros(3, device=rank)
    
    print(f"Rank {rank} before broadcast: {tensor}")
    
    # Broadcast from rank 0 to all others
    dist.broadcast(tensor, src=0)
    
    print(f"Rank {rank} after broadcast: {tensor}")
    
    cleanup()
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Rank 0 before broadcast: tensor([1., 2., 3.], device='cuda:0')
Rank 1 before broadcast: tensor([0., 0., 0.], device='cuda:1')
Rank 2 before broadcast: tensor([0., 0., 0.], device='cuda:2')
Rank 3 before broadcast: tensor([0., 0., 0.], device='cuda:3')
Rank 0 after broadcast: tensor([1., 2., 3.], device='cuda:0')
Rank 1 after broadcast: tensor([1., 2., 3.], device='cuda:1')
Rank 2 after broadcast: tensor([1., 2., 3.], device='cuda:2')
Rank 3 after broadcast: tensor([1., 2., 3.], device='cuda:3')
```

## Real-World Example: Image Classification with NCCL

Let's implement a more practical example - distributed training of a ResNet model on the CIFAR-10 dataset using NCCL backend:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.distributed as dist
import torch.multiprocessing as mp
from torch.nn.parallel import DistributedDataParallel as DDP
import torchvision
import torchvision.transforms as transforms
from torch.utils.data.distributed import DistributedSampler

def setup(rank, world_size):
    os.environ['MASTER_ADDR'] = 'localhost'
    os.environ['MASTER_PORT'] = '12355'
    dist.init_process_group("nccl", rank=rank, world_size=world_size)
    torch.cuda.set_device(rank)

def cleanup():
    dist.destroy_process_group()

def train_resnet(rank, world_size, epochs=5):
    setup(rank, world_size)
    
    # Define transforms
    transform = transforms.Compose([
        transforms.RandomCrop(32, padding=4),
        transforms.RandomHorizontalFlip(),
        transforms.ToTensor(),
        transforms.Normalize((0.4914, 0.4822, 0.4465), (0.2023, 0.1994, 0.2010)),
    ])
    
    # Setup dataset and dataloader with DistributedSampler
    train_dataset = torchvision.datasets.CIFAR10(
        root='./data', train=True, download=True, transform=transform
    )
    train_sampler = DistributedSampler(train_dataset, num_replicas=world_size, rank=rank)
    train_loader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(
        train_dataset, batch_size=128, sampler=train_sampler, num_workers=2
    )
    
    # Create model and move to GPU
    model = torchvision.models.resnet18(pretrained=False, num_classes=10).to(rank)
    
    # Wrap model with DDP
    ddp_model = DDP(model, device_ids=[rank])
    
    # Define loss function and optimizer
    criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
    optimizer = torch.optim.SGD(ddp_model.parameters(), lr=0.01, momentum=0.9, weight_decay=5e-4)
    scheduler = torch.optim.lr_scheduler.CosineAnnealingLR(optimizer, T_max=epochs)
    
    # Training loop
    for epoch in range(epochs):
        train_sampler.set_epoch(epoch)
        ddp_model.train()
        running_loss = 0.0
        correct = 0
        total = 0
        
        if rank == 0:
            print(f"Epoch {epoch+1}/{epochs}")
        
        for i, (inputs, targets) in enumerate(train_loader):
            inputs, targets = inputs.to(rank), targets.to(rank)
            
            # Forward pass
            outputs = ddp_model(inputs)
            loss = criterion(outputs, targets)
            
            # Backward and optimize
            optimizer.zero_grad()
            loss.backward()
            optimizer.step()
            
            # Statistics
            running_loss += loss.item()
            _, predicted = outputs.max(1)
            total += targets.size(0)
            correct += predicted.eq(targets).sum().item()
            
            if rank == 0 and i % 100 == 99:
                print(f'Batch: {i+1}, Loss: {running_loss/100:.3f}, '
                      f'Accuracy: {100.*correct/total:.2f}%')
                running_loss = 0.0
        
        scheduler.step()
    
    cleanup()

def main():
    world_size = torch.cuda.device_count()
    print(f"Training with {world_size} GPUs using NCCL backend")
    mp.spawn(train_resnet, args=(world_size,), nprocs=world_size, join=True)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Training with 4 GPUs using NCCL backend
Epoch 1/5
Batch: 100, Loss: 1.842, Accuracy: 34.25%
Batch: 200, Loss: 1.524, Accuracy: 45.78%
...
Epoch 5/5
Batch: 100, Loss: 0.423, Accuracy: 85.67%
Batch: 200, Loss: 0.387, Accuracy: 86.92%
...
```

## NCCL Configuration and Tuning

To get the best performance from NCCL, you can configure various environment variables:

```bash
# Set visible devices for NCCL
export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1,2,3

# Enable NCCL debugging
export NCCL_DEBUG=INFO

# Set network interface for NCCL
export NCCL_SOCKET_IFNAME=eth0

# Configure P2P communication
export NCCL_P2P_DISABLE=0  # Enable P2P (default)

# Set IB transport
export NCCL_IB_DISABLE=0  # Enable InfiniBand (default)
```

You can set these variables in your Python script as well:

```python
import os
os.environ['NCCL_DEBUG'] = 'INFO'
os.environ['NCCL_SOCKET_IFNAME'] = 'eth0'

# Then initialize the process group
dist.init_process_group("nccl", ...)
```

## Troubleshooting NCCL Issues

Common NCCL issues and their solutions:

1. **"NCCL version mismatch" error**:
   - Ensure all nodes have the same NCCL version installed

2. **"Timeout detected during NCCL initialization" error**:
   - Check network connectivity between nodes
   - Increase timeout: `export NCCL_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=600`

3. **Performance issues**:
   - Check if NVLink is being used: `export NCCL_DEBUG=INFO`
   - Try different NCCL algorithms: `export NCCL_ALGO=Ring`

4. **"NCCL failure" during training**:
   - Increase system shared memory: `--shm-size=8g` in Docker
   - Check GPU memory usage and reduce batch size if needed

## Summary

NCCL is a powerful library for multi-GPU communication in PyTorch distributed training, offering:

- High-performance collective communication optimized for NVIDIA GPUs
- Seamless integration with PyTorch's distributed framework
- Support for various network technologies (NVLink, PCIe, InfiniBand)
