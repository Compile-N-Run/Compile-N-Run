# PyTorch Reinforcement Learning

Welcome to our guide on Reinforcement Learning (RL) with PyTorch! In this tutorial, we'll explore how to implement reinforcement learning algorithms using PyTorch's powerful deep learning framework.

## Introduction to Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement Learning is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment. The agent receives rewards or penalties based on its actions, and its goal is to learn a strategy (policy) that maximizes the total reward over time.

Key components of RL include:

- **Agent**: The decision-maker that interacts with the environment
- **Environment**: The world in which the agent operates
- **State**: The current situation of the agent in the environment
- **Action**: What the agent can do in each state
- **Reward**: Feedback from the environment based on the agent's actions
- **Policy**: The strategy that the agent follows to determine actions

## Setting Up Your Environment

Before diving into the code, make sure you have the necessary libraries installed:

```bash
pip install torch gymnasium numpy matplotlib
```

We'll use:
- PyTorch for neural network implementation
- Gymnasium (successor to OpenAI Gym) for RL environments
- NumPy for numerical operations
- Matplotlib for visualizations

## Deep Q-Network (DQN): A Basic RL Algorithm

Let's implement a Deep Q-Network, one of the most fundamental deep reinforcement learning algorithms.

### 1. Creating the Neural Network

First, we'll define our Q-network using PyTorch:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
import numpy as np

# Define the Q-Network architecture
class QNetwork(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, state_size, action_size, hidden_size=64):
        super(QNetwork, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(state_size, hidden_size)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(hidden_size, hidden_size)
        self.fc3 = nn.Linear(hidden_size, action_size)
        
    def forward(self, state):
        x = torch.relu(self.fc1(state))
        x = torch.relu(self.fc2(x))
        return self.fc3(x)  # Q-values for each action
```

This neural network takes a state as input and outputs Q-values for each possible action.

### 2. Implementing the DQN Agent

Now, let's build our DQN agent:

```python
import random
from collections import deque

class DQNAgent:
    def __init__(self, state_size, action_size, seed=0):
        self.state_size = state_size
        self.action_size = action_size
        self.seed = random.seed(seed)
        
        # Q-Network
        self.qnetwork = QNetwork(state_size, action_size)
        self.optimizer = optim.Adam(self.qnetwork.parameters(), lr=5e-4)
        
        # Replay memory
        self.memory = deque(maxlen=10000)
        self.batch_size = 64
        self.gamma = 0.99    # discount factor
        self.epsilon = 1.0   # exploration rate
        self.epsilon_min = 0.01
        self.epsilon_decay = 0.995
        
    def step(self, state, action, reward, next_state, done):
        # Save experience in replay memory
        self.memory.append((state, action, reward, next_state, done))
        
        # Learn if enough samples are available in memory
        if len(self.memory) > self.batch_size:
            experiences = random.sample(self.memory, self.batch_size)
            self.learn(experiences)
            
    def act(self, state, eval_mode=False):
        state = torch.from_numpy(state).float().unsqueeze(0)
        
        # Epsilon-greedy action selection
        if not eval_mode and random.random() < self.epsilon:
            return random.choice(np.arange(self.action_size))
        
        self.qnetwork.eval()
        with torch.no_grad():
            action_values = self.qnetwork(state)
        self.qnetwork.train()
        
        # Greedy action selection
        return np.argmax(action_values.cpu().data.numpy())
    
    def learn(self, experiences):
        states, actions, rewards, next_states, dones = zip(*experiences)
        
        # Convert to PyTorch tensors
        states = torch.from_numpy(np.vstack(states)).float()
        actions = torch.from_numpy(np.vstack(actions)).long()
        rewards = torch.from_numpy(np.vstack(rewards)).float()
        next_states = torch.from_numpy(np.vstack(next_states)).float()
        dones = torch.from_numpy(np.vstack(dones).astype(np.uint8)).float()
        
        # Get max predicted Q values for next states
        Q_targets_next = self.qnetwork(next_states).detach().max(1)[0].unsqueeze(1)
        
        # Compute Q targets for current states
        Q_targets = rewards + (self.gamma * Q_targets_next * (1 - dones))
        
        # Get expected Q values from local model
        Q_expected = self.qnetwork(states).gather(1, actions)
        
        # Compute loss
        loss = nn.MSELoss()(Q_expected, Q_targets)
        
        # Minimize the loss
        self.optimizer.zero_grad()
        loss.backward()
        self.optimizer.step()
        
        # Update epsilon
        self.epsilon = max(self.epsilon_min, self.epsilon * self.epsilon_decay)
```

### 3. Training the Agent

Let's train our agent on the CartPole environment:

```python
import gymnasium as gym
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Create the environment
env = gym.make('CartPole-v1')
state_size = env.observation_space.shape[0]
action_size = env.action_space.n

# Initialize agent
agent = DQNAgent(state_size, action_size)

# Training parameters
n_episodes = 500
max_t = 1000
eps_start = 1.0
eps_end = 0.01
eps_decay = 0.995

# Lists to track progress
scores = []
scores_window = deque(maxlen=100)
eps = eps_start

# Training loop
for i_episode in range(1, n_episodes+1):
    state, _ = env.reset()
    score = 0
    for t in range(max_t):
        action = agent.act(state)
        next_state, reward, terminated, truncated, _ = env.step(action)
        done = terminated or truncated
        agent.step(state, action, reward, next_state, done)
        state = next_state
        score += reward
        if done:
            break
    
    scores_window.append(score)
    scores.append(score)
    
    print(f'\rEpisode {i_episode}\tAverage Score: {np.mean(scores_window):.2f}', end="")
    if i_episode % 100 == 0:
        print(f'\rEpisode {i_episode}\tAverage Score: {np.mean(scores_window):.2f}')
    if np.mean(scores_window) >= 195.0:
        print(f'\nEnvironment solved in {i_episode-100} episodes!\tAverage Score: {np.mean(scores_window):.2f}')
        torch.save(agent.qnetwork.state_dict(), 'checkpoint.pth')
        break

# Plot the scores
plt.figure(figsize=(10,6))
plt.plot(np.arange(len(scores)), scores)
plt.ylabel('Score')
plt.xlabel('Episode #')
plt.title('DQN Training Progress')
plt.show()
```

**Output (will vary):**
```
Episode 100	Average Score: 23.45
Episode 200	Average Score: 67.82
Episode 300	Average Score: 125.64
Episode 400	Average Score: 178.91
Environment solved in 426 episodes!	Average Score: 195.32
```

## Understanding the Implementation

Let's break down what's happening in the implementation above:

1. **QNetwork**: This neural network approximates the Q-value function, which predicts the expected future rewards for each action in a given state.

2. **DQNAgent**:
   - Uses a replay buffer to store and sample past experiences
   - Implements epsilon-greedy exploration to balance exploration and exploitation
   - Updates the Q-network using the Bellman equation to minimize the difference between predicted and target Q-values

3. **Training Loop**:
   - Runs episodes where the agent interacts with the environment
   - Collects experiences and updates the agent's knowledge
   - Tracks performance over time

## Advanced RL Technique: Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C)

Now, let's implement a more advanced algorithm called Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C), which uses both policy and value networks:

```python
class ActorCritic(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, state_size, action_size, hidden_size=64):
        super(ActorCritic, self).__init__()
        
        # Common feature extractor
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(state_size, hidden_size)
        
        # Actor (Policy) network
        self.actor = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(hidden_size, hidden_size),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(hidden_size, action_size),
            nn.Softmax(dim=1)
        )
        
        # Critic (Value) network
        self.critic = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(hidden_size, hidden_size),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(hidden_size, 1)
        )
        
    def forward(self, state):
        x = torch.relu(self.fc1(state))
        
        # Actor: action probability distribution
        action_probs = self.actor(x)
        
        # Critic: state value
        state_value = self.critic(x)
        
        return action_probs, state_value
    
    def act(self, state):
        state = torch.from_numpy(state).float().unsqueeze(0)
        action_probs, _ = self.forward(state)
        action_dist = torch.distributions.Categorical(action_probs)
        action = action_dist.sample()
        return action.item(), action_dist.log_prob(action)
```

The complete A2C implementation would be more complex, but this gives you the core network architecture. The actor predicts which actions to take, while the critic evaluates how good the current state is.

## Real-World Application: Stock Trading Agent

Let's implement a simplified reinforcement learning agent for stock trading:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

class StockTradingEnv:
    def __init__(self, data, initial_balance=10000):
        self.data = data
        self.initial_balance = initial_balance
        self.reset()
        
    def reset(self):
        self.balance = self.initial_balance
        self.position = 0  # Number of shares
        self.current_step = 0
        self.total_steps = len(self.data) - 1
        return self._get_state()
    
    def _get_state(self):
        # Simple state: price, balance, position
        stock_price = self.data.iloc[self.current_step]['close']
        return np.array([stock_price, self.balance, self.position])
    
    def step(self, action):
        # action: 0 (sell), 1 (hold), 2 (buy)
        self.current_step += 1
        if self.current_step >= self.total_steps:
            done = True
        else:
            done = False
            
        stock_price = self.data.iloc[self.current_step]['close']
        prev_portfolio_value = self.balance + self.position * self.data.iloc[self.current_step-1]['close']
        
        # Execute action
        if action == 0:  # Sell
            if self.position > 0:
                self.balance += stock_price * self.position
                self.position = 0
        elif action == 2:  # Buy
            shares_to_buy = int(self.balance / stock_price)
            if shares_to_buy > 0:
                self.position += shares_to_buy
                self.balance -= shares_to_buy * stock_price
        
        # Calculate reward (portfolio value change)
        current_portfolio_value = self.balance + self.position * stock_price
        reward = current_portfolio_value - prev_portfolio_value
        
        return self._get_state(), reward, done

# Create a simple trading agent
class TradingDQNAgent:
    def __init__(self, state_size, action_size):
        self.model = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(state_size, 64),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(64, 32),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(32, action_size)
        )
        self.optimizer = optim.Adam(self.model.parameters(), lr=0.001)
        self.gamma = 0.95
        self.epsilon = 1.0
        self.epsilon_decay = 0.995
        self.epsilon_min = 0.01
        
    def act(self, state):
        state = torch.FloatTensor(state)
        if np.random.rand() <= self.epsilon:
            return np.random.choice([0, 1, 2])
        q_values = self.model(state)
        return torch.argmax(q_values).item()
    
    def learn(self, state, action, reward, next_state, done):
        state = torch.FloatTensor(state)
        next_state = torch.FloatTensor(next_state)
        
        # Predict Q-values
        q_values = self.model(state)
        
        # Target Q-values
        next_q_values = self.model(next_state).detach()
        target_q = q_values.clone()
        
        if done:
            target_q[action] = reward
        else:
            target_q[action] = reward + self.gamma * torch.max(next_q_values)
        
        # Compute loss and update weights
        loss = nn.MSELoss()(q_values, target_q.unsqueeze(0))
        self.optimizer.zero_grad()
        loss.backward()
        self.optimizer.step()
        
        # Update epsilon
        if self.epsilon > self.epsilon_min:
            self.epsilon *= self.epsilon_decay

# Example usage (requires stock data)
# df = pd.read_csv('stock_data.csv')
# env = StockTradingEnv(df)
# agent = TradingDQNAgent(state_size=3, action_size=3)
#
# # Training loop would go here
```

This simplified trading example shows how RL can be applied to financial markets. In a real-world scenario, you would use more sophisticated state representations, reward functions, and possibly more advanced algorithms.

## Practical Considerations for RL

Reinforcement learning can be challenging to implement effectively. Here are some practical tips:

1. **Reward Engineering**: Carefully design your reward function to guide the agent toward desired behavior.

2. **Exploration vs. Exploitation**: Balance trying new actions (exploration) and leveraging known good actions (exploitation).

3. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: RL algorithms are sensitive to hyperparameters like learning rate, discount factor, and network architecture.

4. **Sample Efficiency**: RL algorithms often require many interactions with the environment. Consider using techniques like prioritized experience replay to improve efficiency.

5. **Environment Design**: If creating your own environment, ensure it provides clear and informative feedback to the agent.
