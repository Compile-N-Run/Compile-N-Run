# Pandas Performance Overview

## Introduction

Pandas is a powerful Python library for data manipulation and analysis, but it can sometimes be slow when dealing with large datasets. Understanding how pandas works under the hood and applying performance optimization techniques can significantly speed up your data processing workflows.

In this guide, we'll explore common performance bottlenecks in pandas and learn practical strategies to make your pandas code run faster and more efficiently. Whether you're working with thousands or millions of rows, these techniques will help you get the most out of pandas.

## Why Performance Matters in Pandas

When working with small datasets, pandas operations usually execute quickly. However, as data size increases, you might notice that:

- Operations take longer to complete
- Memory usage spikes dramatically
- Your system becomes slow or unresponsive

Optimizing pandas performance isn't just about speed—it's also about making your code more reliable, reducing memory usage, and enabling you to work with larger datasets on limited hardware.

## Common Performance Bottlenecks

### 1. Inefficient Iteration

One of the most common mistakes beginners make is using Python loops to iterate through pandas DataFrames.

❌ **Inefficient approach with loop:**

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import time

# Create a sample DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame(np.random.rand(100000, 5), columns=['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E'])

# Inefficient: Using a loop to transform data
start_time = time.time()
for i in range(len(df)):
    df.loc[i, 'F'] = df.loc[i, 'A'] * df.loc[i, 'B']
print(f"Loop method took {time.time() - start_time:.4f} seconds")
```

Output:
```
Loop method took 3.5421 seconds
```

✅ **Efficient approach with vectorization:**

```python
# Reset the DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame(np.random.rand(100000, 5), columns=['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E'])

# Efficient: Using vectorization
start_time = time.time()
df['F'] = df['A'] * df['B']
print(f"Vectorized method took {time.time() - start_time:.4f} seconds")
```

Output:
```
Vectorized method took 0.0028 seconds
```

The vectorized approach is over 1000 times faster! This is because pandas operations are optimized to work on entire columns at once, leveraging C-based implementations behind the scenes.

### 2. Using .apply() Inefficiently

While `.apply()` is more efficient than loops, it's still slower than pure vectorized operations:

```python
# Using apply (better than loops, but still not optimal)
start_time = time.time()
df['F'] = df.apply(lambda row: row['A'] * row['B'], axis=1)
print(f"Apply method took {time.time() - start_time:.4f} seconds")
```

Output:
```
Apply method took 0.2365 seconds
```

### 3. Memory Inefficiency

Pandas objects can consume a lot of memory, especially with large datasets:

```python
# Check memory usage
def memory_usage(df):
    return f"Memory usage: {df.memory_usage(deep=True).sum() / 1024 / 1024:.2f} MB"

print(memory_usage(df))
```

Output:
```
Memory usage: 4.77 MB
```

## Performance Improvement Strategies

### 1. Use Appropriate Data Types

One of the easiest ways to improve performance is to use the right data types:

```python
# Create a DataFrame with default data types
df_default = pd.DataFrame({
    'id': np.arange(1000000),
    'value': np.random.randn(1000000),
    'category': np.random.choice(['A', 'B', 'C', 'D'], 1000000)
})

print(memory_usage(df_default))

# Optimize data types
df_optimized = pd.DataFrame({
    'id': np.arange(1000000, dtype=np.uint32),  # Using uint32 instead of int64
    'value': np.random.randn(1000000).astype(np.float32),  # float32 instead of float64
    'category': pd.Categorical(np.random.choice(['A', 'B', 'C', 'D'], 1000000))  # Using categorical
})

print(memory_usage(df_optimized))
```

Output:
```
Memory usage: 24.41 MB
Memory usage: 12.74 MB
```

The optimized DataFrame uses almost 50% less memory!

### 2. Use Vectorized Operations

As we've seen earlier, vectorized operations are much faster than loops. Here are more examples:

```python
# Sample DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame({
    'A': np.random.rand(100000),
    'B': np.random.rand(100000),
    'C': np.random.rand(100000)
})

# Vectorized calculations
start_time = time.time()
result = df['A'] + df['B'] * df['C'] - df['A'].mean()
print(f"Vectorized operation took {time.time() - start_time:.4f} seconds")
```

Output:
```
Vectorized operation took 0.0034 seconds
```

### 3. Chunk Large Operations

When working with very large datasets, processing data in chunks can help manage memory usage:

```python
# Simulating working with a large file
def process_large_file(filename, chunksize=10000):
    # Initialize result container
    result = pd.Series()
    
    # Process file in chunks
    for chunk in pd.read_csv(filename, chunksize=chunksize):
        # Process each chunk (for example, calculate mean of a column)
        chunk_result = chunk['value'].mean()
        result = result.append(pd.Series([chunk_result]))
    
    return result.mean()

# In practice, you would use:
# result = process_large_file('large_data.csv', chunksize=100000)
```

### 4. Use Query and Eval for Complex Filters

For complex filtering operations, `.query()` can be faster than using multiple boolean masks:

```python
# Create a larger DataFrame
large_df = pd.DataFrame({
    'A': np.random.rand(1000000),
    'B': np.random.rand(1000000),
    'C': np.random.rand(1000000),
    'D': np.random.choice(['X', 'Y', 'Z'], 1000000)
})

# Standard filtering
start_time = time.time()
filtered_standard = large_df[(large_df['A'] > 0.5) & 
                            (large_df['B'] < 0.5) & 
                            (large_df['C'] > 0.7) & 
                            (large_df['D'] == 'X')]
print(f"Standard filtering took {time.time() - start_time:.4f} seconds")

# Query filtering
start_time = time.time()
filtered_query = large_df.query('A > 0.5 and B < 0.5 and C > 0.7 and D == "X"')
print(f"Query filtering took {time.time() - start_time:.4f} seconds")
```

Output:
```
Standard filtering took 0.0381 seconds
Query filtering took 0.0297 seconds
```

### 5. Use Methods with Inbuilt Optimization

Many pandas methods have built-in optimizations that make them faster than DIY approaches:

```python
# Creating a sample DataFrame with duplicates
df_dupes = pd.DataFrame({
    'id': np.random.choice(range(1000), 100000, replace=True),
    'value': np.random.randn(100000)
})

# Method 1: Using groupby (optimized)
start_time = time.time()
result1 = df_dupes.groupby('id')['value'].mean()
print(f"Groupby method took {time.time() - start_time:.4f} seconds")

# Method 2: Manual approach (slow)
start_time = time.time()
result2 = {}
for id_val in df_dupes['id'].unique():
    result2[id_val] = df_dupes[df_dupes['id'] == id_val]['value'].mean()
result2 = pd.Series(result2)
print(f"Manual method took {time.time() - start_time:.4f} seconds")
```

Output:
```
Groupby method took 0.0109 seconds
Manual method took 0.9872 seconds
```

## Real-world Performance Example: Analyzing Sales Data

Let's apply these optimization techniques to a practical example—analyzing a year of sales data:

```python
# Generate sample sales data
np.random.seed(42)
dates = pd.date_range('2022-01-01', '2022-12-31')
products = ['Laptop', 'Phone', 'Tablet', 'Monitor', 'Headphones']
regions = ['North', 'South', 'East', 'West']

sales_data = pd.DataFrame({
    'date': np.random.choice(dates, 1000000),
    'product': np.random.choice(products, 1000000),
    'region': np.random.choice(regions, 1000000),
    'units_sold': np.random.randint(1, 50, 1000000),
    'price': np.random.uniform(10, 1000, 1000000).round(2)
})

sales_data['revenue'] = sales_data['units_sold'] * sales_data['price']
```

### Unoptimized Analysis

```python
# Inefficient approach
start_time = time.time()

# 1. Calculate total revenue by region (inefficient approach)
region_revenue = {}
for region in sales_data['region'].unique():
    region_subset = sales_data[sales_data['region'] == region]
    region_revenue[region] = region_subset['revenue'].sum()

# 2. Calculate monthly trends (inefficient approach)
sales_data['month'] = sales_data['date'].dt.month
monthly_revenue = {}
for month in range(1, 13):
    month_subset = sales_data[sales_data['month'] == month]
    monthly_revenue[month] = month_subset['revenue'].sum()

print(f"Unoptimized analysis took {time.time() - start_time:.4f} seconds")
```

### Optimized Analysis

```python
# Efficient approach
start_time = time.time()

# 1. Calculate total revenue by region (efficient approach)
region_revenue_opt = sales_data.groupby('region')['revenue'].sum()

# 2. Calculate monthly trends (efficient approach)
sales_data['month'] = pd.Categorical(sales_data['date'].dt.month, categories=range(1, 13))
monthly_revenue_opt = sales_data.groupby('month')['revenue'].sum()

print(f"Optimized analysis took {time.time() - start_time:.4f} seconds")
```

Output:
```
Unoptimized analysis took 0.8735 seconds
Optimized analysis took 0.0524 seconds
```

The optimized version is approximately 17 times faster!
