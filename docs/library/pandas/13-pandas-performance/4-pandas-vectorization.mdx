# Pandas Vectorization

## Introduction

When working with large datasets in Pandas, you might notice that some operations can become painfully slow. This is where **vectorization** comes to the rescue! Vectorization is the process of executing operations on entire arrays of values instead of using explicit loops to iterate through individual elements. In Pandas, vectorized operations are significantly faster than their loop-based counterparts because they leverage optimized C code under the hood.

In this tutorial, we'll explore:
- What vectorization means in Pandas
- How to replace loops with vectorized operations
- Common vectorization patterns
- Performance comparisons between vectorized and non-vectorized code

## What is Vectorization?

Vectorization is the practice of applying operations to entire arrays at once rather than element by element. In Pandas, this means manipulating entire columns or DataFrames simultaneously instead of iterating through rows.

The key benefits of vectorization include:
- **Improved performance**: Operations run much faster
- **Cleaner code**: More concise and readable code
- **Memory efficiency**: Better memory management by avoiding intermediate objects

## Loops vs. Vectorized Operations

Let's start with a simple example to illustrate the difference between using loops and vectorized operations.

### The Loop Approach

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import time

# Create a sample DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame({
    'A': np.random.randint(0, 100, size=100000),
    'B': np.random.randint(0, 100, size=100000)
})

# Using a loop to add 10 to each value in column A
start_time = time.time()

for i in range(len(df)):
    df.at[i, 'A'] = df.at[i, 'A'] + 10

end_time = time.time()
print(f"Loop approach time: {end_time - start_time:.5f} seconds")
```

Output:
```
Loop approach time: 1.25631 seconds
```

### The Vectorized Approach

```python
# Reset the DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame({
    'A': np.random.randint(0, 100, size=100000),
    'B': np.random.randint(0, 100, size=100000)
})

# Using vectorization to add 10 to each value in column A
start_time = time.time()

df['A'] = df['A'] + 10

end_time = time.time()
print(f"Vectorized approach time: {end_time - start_time:.5f} seconds")
```

Output:
```
Vectorized approach time: 0.00124 seconds
```

As you can see, the vectorized approach is roughly 1000 times faster! This performance difference becomes even more significant with larger datasets.

## Common Vectorized Operations in Pandas

Here are some common operations that can be vectorized in Pandas:

### Mathematical Operations

```python
# Apply mathematical operations directly to columns
df['C'] = df['A'] + df['B']  # Addition
df['D'] = df['A'] * df['B']  # Multiplication
df['E'] = np.sqrt(df['A'])   # Square root
df['F'] = df['A'] ** 2       # Square
```

### Conditional Operations

```python
# Create a new column based on conditions
df['Category'] = np.where(df['A'] > 50, 'High', 'Low')

# More complex conditions
df['Level'] = np.select(
    [df['A'] < 30, df['A'] < 70],
    ['Low', 'Medium'],
    default='High'
)

# Display the first few rows
print(df.head())
```

Output:
```
    A   B   C    D         E     F Category  Level
0  64  24  88  1536  8.000000  4096     High    Medium
1  27  32  59   864  5.196152   729      Low      Low
2  52  17  69   884  7.211103  2704     High    Medium
3  38  91  129  3458  6.164414  1444      Low    Medium
4  72  49  121  3528  8.485281  5184     High     High
```

### String Operations

```python
# Create a sample DataFrame with text
text_df = pd.DataFrame({
    'text': ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'date', 'elderberry']
})

# Apply string operations
text_df['uppercase'] = text_df['text'].str.upper()
text_df['length'] = text_df['text'].str.len()
text_df['contains_a'] = text_df['text'].str.contains('a')

print(text_df)
```

Output:
```
         text       uppercase  length  contains_a
0       apple          APPLE       5        True
1      banana         BANANA       6        True
2      cherry         CHERRY       6       False
3        date           DATE       4        True
4  elderberry     ELDERBERRY      10        True
```

## Advanced Vectorization Techniques

### Using `apply()` with Vectorized Functions

While `apply()` is not as fast as pure vectorized operations, using it with NumPy or other vectorized functions can still be efficient:

```python
import numpy as np

# Create a sample DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame({
    'values': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
})

# Less efficient way - using apply with a regular function
def square(x):
    return x ** 2

df['squared_slow'] = df['values'].apply(square)

# More efficient way - using apply with a numpy function
df['squared_fast'] = df['values'].apply(np.square)

# Most efficient way - pure vectorization
df['squared_best'] = np.square(df['values'])

print(df)
```

Output:
```
   values  squared_slow  squared_fast  squared_best
0       1             1             1             1
1       2             4             4             4
2       3             9             9             9
3       4            16            16            16
4       5            25            25            25
```

### Vectorizing Custom Logic with NumPy Functions

```python
# Create a sample DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame({
    'score': [85, 92, 78, 65, 98, 72]
})

# Define grade boundaries
grade_bounds = [0, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100]
grade_labels = ['F', 'D', 'C', 'B', 'A']

# Assign grades using vectorization
df['grade'] = pd.cut(df['score'], bins=grade_bounds, labels=grade_labels, right=False)

print(df)
```

Output:
```
   score grade
0     85     B
1     92     A
2     78     C
3     65     D
4     98     A
5     72     C
```

## Real-World Applications

### Data Cleaning Example

```python
# Create a sample DataFrame with missing and inconsistent data
data = {
    'name': ['John Doe', 'jane smith', 'Bob Johnson', np.nan, 'Sarah WILLIAMS'],
    'age': [32, np.nan, 45, 29, 38],
    'salary': ['$45,000', '$60,000', '$55K', '$70,000', np.nan]
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)
print("Original DataFrame:")
print(df)
```

Output:
```
Original DataFrame:
            name   age   salary
0       John Doe  32.0  $45,000
1     jane smith   NaN  $60,000
2    Bob Johnson  45.0     $55K
3            NaN  29.0  $70,000
4  Sarah WILLIAMS  38.0      NaN
```

Now let's clean this data using vectorized operations:

```python
# Clean names: fill NaN with 'Unknown', standardize case
df['name'] = df['name'].fillna('Unknown').str.title()

# Fill missing ages with the mean age
df['age'] = df['age'].fillna(df['age'].mean())

# Clean salary: standardize format and convert to numeric
# First, extract just the numeric part
df['salary'] = df['salary'].fillna('$0')
df['salary_numeric'] = df['salary'].str.replace('[$,K]', '', regex=True).astype(float)
# Convert K to thousands
df.loc[df['salary'].str.contains('K'), 'salary_numeric'] *= 1000

print("\nCleaned DataFrame:")
print(df)
```

Output:
```
Cleaned DataFrame:
            name        age   salary  salary_numeric
0       John Doe  32.000000  $45,000        45000.0
1     Jane Smith  36.000000  $60,000        60000.0
2    Bob Johnson  45.000000     $55K        55000.0
3        Unknown  29.000000  $70,000        70000.0
4  Sarah Williams  38.000000       $0            0.0
```

### Financial Data Analysis

```python
# Create a sample stock price DataFrame
dates = pd.date_range('2023-01-01', periods=10, freq='D')
stock_data = pd.DataFrame({
    'date': dates,
    'price': [100, 102, 104, 103, 105, 107, 108, 106, 104, 105]
})

# Calculate daily returns
stock_data['daily_return'] = stock_data['price'].pct_change() * 100

# Calculate moving average
stock_data['moving_avg_3d'] = stock_data['price'].rolling(window=3).mean()

# Calculate if price is above moving average
stock_data['above_avg'] = stock_data['price'] > stock_data['moving_avg_3d']

print(stock_data)
```

Output:
```
        date  price  daily_return  moving_avg_3d  above_avg
0 2023-01-01  100.0           NaN            NaN       False
1 2023-01-02  102.0     2.000000            NaN       False
2 2023-01-03  104.0     1.960784     102.000000        True
3 2023-01-04  103.0    -0.961538     103.000000        True
4 2023-01-05  105.0     1.941748     104.000000        True
5 2023-01-06  107.0     1.904762     105.000000        True
6 2023-01-07  108.0     0.934579     106.666667        True
7 2023-01-08  106.0    -1.851852     107.000000       False
8 2023-01-09  104.0    -1.886792     106.000000       False
9 2023-01-10  105.0     0.961538     105.000000        True
```

## Performance Comparison

Let's compare the performance of vectorized operations to loop-based approaches with a larger dataset:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import time

# Create a larger dataset
n = 1000000
df = pd.DataFrame({
    'A': np.random.randint(0, 100, size=n),
    'B': np.random.randint(0, 100, size=n)
})

# Task: Compute A^2 + B for each row

# Method 1: Using loops
def method_loop():
    result = np.zeros(n)
    start_time = time.time()
    
    for i in range(n):
        result[i] = df.iloc[i, 0]**2 + df.iloc[i, 1]
    
    elapsed = time.time() - start_time
    print(f"Loop method: {elapsed:.4f} seconds")
    return result

# Method 2: Using apply (row-wise)
def method_apply():
    start_time = time.time()
    
    result = df.apply(lambda row: row['A']**2 + row['B'], axis=1)
    
    elapsed = time.time() - start_time
    print(f"Apply method: {elapsed:.4f} seconds")
    return result

# Method 3: Using vectorization
def method_vector():
    start_time = time.time()
    
    result = df['A']**2 + df['B']
    
    elapsed = time.time() - start_time
    print(f"Vectorized method: {elapsed:.4f} seconds")
    return result

# Run the performance comparison
# Note: The loop method might be very slow, you can reduce n if needed
loop_result = method_loop()
apply_result = method_apply()
vector_result = method_vector()

# Verify all methods give the same result
print(f"All methods equal: {np.allclose(loop_result, vector_result) and np.allclose(apply_result, vector_result)}")
```

Output:
```
Loop method: 21.5672 seconds
Apply method: 1.2346 seconds
Vectorized method: 0.0083 seconds
All methods equal: True
```

This demonstrates why vectorization is so important for Pandas performance - the vectorized approach is typically hundreds to thousands of times faster than loops!

## When to Use Vectorization

Vectorization is most beneficial when:

1. You're working with large datasets
2. You're performing simple operations across entire columns
3. You need maximum performance

However, there are some cases where vectorization might not be the best choice:

1. When your operations are very complex and don't map well to NumPy/Pandas functions
2. When you need row-by-row processing that depends on previous rows' results
3. When dealing with custom objects or complex data structures that don't translate well to arrays

## Summary
