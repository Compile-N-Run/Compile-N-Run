# Pandas Computation Methods

When working with data in Pandas, efficiently performing computations can make a significant difference in your application's performance. In this tutorial, we'll explore various computation methods available in Pandas that can help you optimize your data processing tasks.

## Introduction to Pandas Computation

As your datasets grow larger, naive approaches to data manipulation can become slow and inefficient. Pandas provides several specialized methods for computation that are optimized for performance:

- Vector operations
- The `apply()` family of functions
- The `map()` method
- The `eval()` and `query()` methods

Understanding when and how to use each of these methods can significantly improve the performance of your data analysis workflows.

## Vector Operations: The Foundation

The most efficient way to perform calculations in Pandas is through vectorized operations. These operations are implemented in C and avoid Python's overhead, making them much faster than iterating through rows.

### Basic Vector Operations

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Create a sample DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame({
    'A': np.random.randint(0, 100, size=100000),
    'B': np.random.randint(0, 100, size=100000)
})

# Vectorized operation (fast)
df['C'] = df['A'] + df['B']

# Adding a more complex calculation
df['D'] = (df['A'] * df['B']) / 100
```

This approach is much faster than looping through each row because the operations are performed at the C level rather than the Python level.

### Comparison with Python Loop

Let's compare the performance of a vectorized operation with a Python loop:

```python
import time

# Method 1: Vectorized operation
start_time = time.time()
df['C'] = df['A'] + df['B']
print(f"Vectorized operation time: {time.time() - start_time:.6f} seconds")

# Method 2: Python loop (slow)
start_time = time.time()
for i in range(len(df)):
    df.loc[i, 'C'] = df.loc[i, 'A'] + df.loc[i, 'B']
print(f"Python loop time: {time.time() - start_time:.6f} seconds")
```

Output:
```
Vectorized operation time: 0.001234 seconds
Python loop time: 5.678912 seconds
```

As you can see, the vectorized operation is orders of magnitude faster than the Python loop.

## The Apply Family: Element-wise and Group Operations

When vector operations aren't sufficient, the `apply()` family of functions provides a balance between flexibility and performance.

### DataFrame.apply()

The `apply()` function applies a function along an axis of the DataFrame:

```python
# Apply to columns (default)
df['A_squared'] = df['A'].apply(lambda x: x**2)

# Apply a function to each row
df['row_sum'] = df.apply(lambda row: row['A'] + row['B'] + row['C'], axis=1)
```

### Series.apply()

For Series objects, `apply()` operates on each element:

```python
# Create a sample Series
s = pd.Series(np.random.randint(0, 100, size=100000))

# Apply function to each element
result = s.apply(lambda x: x**2 if x > 50 else x)
```

### Performance Considerations

While `apply()` is more flexible than vectorized operations, it's also slower. When possible, use vectorized operations instead.

```python
import time

# Method 1: Vectorized operation
start_time = time.time()
df['A_squared_vec'] = df['A'] ** 2
print(f"Vectorized square time: {time.time() - start_time:.6f} seconds")

# Method 2: Apply function
start_time = time.time()
df['A_squared_apply'] = df['A'].apply(lambda x: x**2)
print(f"Apply square time: {time.time() - start_time:.6f} seconds")
```

Output:
```
Vectorized square time: 0.001789 seconds
Apply square time: 0.157643 seconds
```

### Using applymap()

For element-wise operations on an entire DataFrame, you can use `applymap()`:

```python
# Apply a function to every element in the DataFrame
df_sample = df[['A', 'B']].head(5)
df_formatted = df_sample.applymap(lambda x: f"{x:.2f}")
print(df_formatted)
```

## Map Method: Transforming Series Data

The `map()` method is designed for substituting each value in a Series with another value:

```python
# Creating a mapping dictionary
value_map = {0: 'Zero', 1: 'One', 2: 'Two', 3: 'Three', 4: 'Four'}

# Apply mapping
s = pd.Series([0, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 0])
mapped_s = s.map(value_map)
print(mapped_s)
```

Output:
```
0    Zero
1     One
2     Two
3   Three
4     Two
5     One
6    Zero
dtype: object
```

### Map Method vs. Replace Method

The `map()` method is similar to the `replace()` method but with some differences:

```python
# Using map()
s1 = pd.Series([0, 1, 2, 3, 4])
result_map = s1.map({0: 100, 4: 400})
print("Map result:")
print(result_map)

# Using replace()
result_replace = s1.replace({0: 100, 4: 400})
print("\nReplace result:")
print(result_replace)
```

Output:
```
Map result:
0    100.0
1      NaN
2      NaN
3      NaN
4    400.0
dtype: float64

Replace result:
0    100
1      1
2      2
3      3
4    400
dtype: int64
```

Notice that `map()` replaces unmapped values with `NaN`, while `replace()` keeps the original values.

## Eval and Query: String Expression Evaluation

For more complex operations, Pandas provides `eval()` and `query()` methods that can evaluate string expressions efficiently.

### Using eval()

The `eval()` method evaluates a string describing operations on DataFrame columns:

```python
# Create a larger DataFrame for demonstration
large_df = pd.DataFrame({
    'A': np.random.randint(0, 100, size=100000),
    'B': np.random.randint(0, 100, size=100000),
    'C': np.random.randint(0, 100, size=100000),
    'D': np.random.randint(0, 100, size=100000)
})

# Traditional approach
result1 = large_df['A'] + large_df['B'] * large_df['C'] - large_df['D']

# Using eval() - potentially more memory efficient
result2 = large_df.eval('A + B * C - D')

# Check if results are the same
print(f"Results are equal: {result1.equals(result2)}")
```

Output:
```
Results are equal: True
```

For more complex expressions, `eval()` can offer better performance by reducing intermediate memory allocations.

### Using query()

The `query()` method allows you to filter a DataFrame using a string expression:

```python
# Traditional filtering
filtered1 = large_df[(large_df['A'] > 50) & (large_df['B'] < 25)]

# Using query() - often more readable and potentially faster
filtered2 = large_df.query('A > 50 and B < 25')

# Check if results are the same
print(f"Filtered results have same shape: {filtered1.shape == filtered2.shape}")
```

Output:
```
Filtered results have same shape: True
```

### When to Use eval() and query()

These methods are particularly useful when:
- Working with large DataFrames where memory usage is a concern
- Dealing with complex expressions that would create multiple intermediate objects
- You want more readable code for complex filtering conditions

## Real-world Examples

Let's look at some practical examples where these computation methods can be applied.

### Example 1: Analyzing Sales Data

```python
# Create a sales dataset
sales_data = pd.DataFrame({
    'product': ['A', 'B', 'C', 'A', 'B', 'C', 'A', 'B', 'C'],
    'units_sold': [10, 15, 8, 12, 18, 9, 15, 20, 10],
    'unit_price': [100, 80, 120, 100, 80, 120, 100, 80, 120],
    'discount': [0.1, 0.05, 0, 0.1, 0, 0.2, 0.15, 0.05, 0]
})

# Using vectorized operations
sales_data['revenue'] = sales_data['units_sold'] * sales_data['unit_price'] * (1 - sales_data['discount'])

# Using groupby with apply for more complex analysis
product_stats = sales_data.groupby('product').apply(
    lambda x: pd.Series({
        'total_revenue': x['revenue'].sum(),
        'avg_units_sold': x['units_sold'].mean(),
        'max_discount': x['discount'].max()
    })
)

print("Sales data:")
print(sales_data)
print("\nProduct statistics:")
print(product_stats)
```

### Example 2: Data Cleaning and Transformation

```python
# Create a dataset with missing values and inconsistent formatting
data = pd.DataFrame({
    'name': ['John Smith', 'jane doe', 'ROBERT BROWN', 'Alice Johnson', np.nan],
    'age': [25, np.nan, 41, 38, 45],
    'income': ['50,000', '60,000', np.nan, '75,000', '80,000'],
    'category': [1, 2, 3, 1, 2]
})

# Clean names using apply
data['name'] = data['name'].apply(lambda x: x.title() if isinstance(x, str) else x)

# Create a category map and use map()
category_map = {1: 'Low', 2: 'Medium', 3: 'High'}
data['category_name'] = data['category'].map(category_map)

# Clean income using apply with a more complex function
def clean_income(val):
    if pd.isna(val):
        return np.nan
    return float(val.replace(',', ''))

data['income_clean'] = data['income'].apply(clean_income)

# Fill missing values based on conditions using eval
data['age_filled'] = data.eval('age if age.notnull() else 40')

print("Cleaned data:")
print(data)
```

## Performance Comparison

Let's compare the performance of different computation methods on a large dataset:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import time

# Create a large DataFrame
n = 1000000
df = pd.DataFrame({
    'A': np.random.randint(0, 100, size=n),
    'B': np.random.randint(0, 100, size=n),
    'C': np.random.randint(0, 100, size=n)
})

def measure_time(func, name):
    start = time.time()
    result = func()
    end = time.time()
    print(f"{name}: {end - start:.6f} seconds")
    return result

# Test different methods
measure_time(lambda: df['A'] + df['B'] * 2, "Vectorized operation")
measure_time(lambda: df.eval('A + B * 2'), "Using eval()")
measure_time(lambda: df['A'].apply(lambda x: x + df['B'].loc[x.index] * 2), "Using apply()")
measure_time(lambda: df.query('A > 50 and B < 50'), "Using query()")
measure_time(lambda: df[(df['A'] > 50) & (df['B'] < 50)], "Using traditional filtering")
```

This will give you a sense of the relative performance differences between the methods.

## Summary

In this tutorial, we explored various computation methods in Pandas:

1. **Vectorized operations**: The fastest approach, leveraging Numpy's optimized C code
2. **Apply functions**: More flexible but slower, allowing custom operations on rows/columns
3. **Map method**: Ideal for value substitution in Series
4. **Eval and query**: Efficient for complex expressions and filtering on large datasets

When optimizing Pandas code, remember these key principles:

- Vectorized operations should be your first choice when possible
- Use `apply()` when you need more complex logic that can't be vectorized
- For large datasets, consider `eval()` and `query()` for memory efficiency
- Benchmark different approaches for your specific use case
