# Pandas Dask Introduction

## What is Dask and Why Use It with Pandas?

Pandas is a powerful library for data manipulation and analysis, but it has limitations when dealing with datasets that are larger than your computer's memory. This is where Dask comes in. Dask is a flexible library for parallel computing in Python that extends pandas' functionality to handle larger-than-memory datasets efficiently.

Dask provides:
- Familiar pandas API for working with large datasets
- Parallel execution across multiple cores
- Ability to process data that doesn't fit in memory
- Seamless integration with the pandas ecosystem

In this tutorial, we'll explore how to use Dask with pandas to scale your data analysis workflows.

## Installation

Before we begin, let's install the necessary packages:

```bash
pip install dask[complete] pandas
```

## Getting Started with Dask DataFrames

Dask DataFrames work similarly to pandas DataFrames, but they're designed to handle larger-than-memory datasets by breaking them into smaller chunks.

Let's create a simple Dask DataFrame:

```python
import pandas as pd
import dask.dataframe as dd
import numpy as np

# Create a pandas DataFrame
pdf = pd.DataFrame({
    'id': range(1000),
    'value': np.random.randn(1000),
    'category': np.random.choice(['A', 'B', 'C'], 1000)
})

# Convert to a Dask DataFrame
ddf = dd.from_pandas(pdf, npartitions=4)

print(f"Pandas DataFrame type: {type(pdf)}")
print(f"Dask DataFrame type: {type(ddf)}")
```

Output:
```
Pandas DataFrame type: <class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>
Dask DataFrame type: <class 'dask.dataframe.core.DataFrame'>
```

### Understanding Partitions

The `npartitions` parameter specifies how many chunks Dask will split your data into. These partitions can be processed in parallel, which is how Dask achieves scalability.

## Loading Data with Dask

One of the most common uses of Dask is reading large files:

```python
# Reading a CSV file with Dask
# For demonstration - in real scenarios, this could be a much larger file
ddf = dd.read_csv('sample_data.csv')

# Reading multiple CSV files using wildcards
# ddf = dd.read_csv('data/2023-*.csv')

# Examining the DataFrame
print(ddf.head())
```

Dask can read data from various sources including CSV, Parquet, JSON, and SQL databases, similar to pandas but with the ability to handle much larger datasets.

## Basic Operations with Dask DataFrames

Dask DataFrames support most pandas operations:

```python
import dask.dataframe as dd
import numpy as np

# Create a sample Dask DataFrame
ddf = dd.DataFrame({
    'id': range(1000),
    'value': np.random.randn(1000),
    'category': np.random.choice(['A', 'B', 'C'], 1000)
}, npartitions=4)

# Basic operations
print("First 5 rows:")
print(ddf.head())

print("\nDataFrame info:")
print(ddf.dtypes)

print("\nSummary statistics:")
display_stats = ddf.describe().compute()
print(display_stats)

print("\nGroupby operation:")
groupby_result = ddf.groupby('category')['value'].mean().compute()
print(groupby_result)
```

### Lazy Evaluation

A key difference between Dask and pandas is that Dask operations are lazyâ€”they don't execute until you explicitly ask for a result using `.compute()`:

```python
# This creates a computation graph but doesn't execute it
result = ddf['value'].mean()
print(f"Type before compute: {type(result)}")

# This executes the computation and returns a concrete result
final_result = result.compute()
print(f"Type after compute: {type(final_result)}")
print(f"Result: {final_result}")
```

Output:
```
Type before compute: <class 'dask.dataframe.core.Scalar'>
Type after compute: <class 'float'>
Result: -0.03401457730121312
```

## Working with Larger-Than-Memory Datasets

Here's a more realistic example of how Dask shines with large datasets:

```python
import dask.dataframe as dd
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import os

# Let's generate some sample data files to simulate a large dataset
def create_sample_data(num_files=5, rows_per_file=100000):
    os.makedirs('large_data', exist_ok=True)
    
    for i in range(num_files):
        df = pd.DataFrame({
            'id': range(rows_per_file),
            'value': np.random.randn(rows_per_file),
            'category': np.random.choice(['A', 'B', 'C', 'D'], rows_per_file),
            'timestamp': pd.date_range(start='2023-01-01', periods=rows_per_file, freq='S')
        })
        df.to_csv(f'large_data/data_part_{i}.csv', index=False)
    
    print(f"Created {num_files} CSV files with {rows_per_file} rows each")

# Create sample data
create_sample_data()

# Read all CSV files using Dask
ddf = dd.read_csv('large_data/data_part_*.csv')

# Perform some analysis
result = (ddf
          .groupby('category')
          .agg({'value': ['mean', 'std', 'count']})
          .compute())

print("\nAggregation results by category:")
print(result)

# Time series analysis
print("\nTime series resampling (daily average):")
ddf['timestamp'] = dd.to_datetime(ddf['timestamp'])
daily_avg = ddf.set_index('timestamp').resample('D')['value'].mean().compute()
print(daily_avg.head())
```

This example demonstrates how Dask can:
1. Read multiple files at once using wildcards
2. Perform complex aggregations across the entire dataset
3. Handle time series data with resampling operations

## Performance Comparison: Pandas vs Dask

Let's compare pandas and Dask performance on a medium-sized dataset:

```python
import pandas as pd
import dask.dataframe as dd
import numpy as np
import time

# Create a medium-sized DataFrame
n = 10_000_000  # 10 million rows
df_pandas = pd.DataFrame({
    'key': np.random.randint(0, 1000, size=n),
    'value': np.random.randn(n)
})

# Convert to Dask
df_dask = dd.from_pandas(df_pandas, npartitions=os.cpu_count())

# Pandas timing
start = time.time()
pandas_result = df_pandas.groupby('key')['value'].mean()
pandas_time = time.time() - start
print(f"Pandas computation time: {pandas_time:.2f} seconds")

# Dask timing
start = time.time()
dask_result = df_dask.groupby('key')['value'].mean().compute()
dask_time = time.time() - start
print(f"Dask computation time: {dask_time:.2f} seconds")

# Compare results
pd.testing.assert_series_equal(pandas_result, dask_result.sort_index())
print("Results are identical!")

# Calculate speedup
print(f"Speedup: {pandas_time / dask_time:.2f}x")
```

On multi-core systems, Dask often provides significant speedups for these operations because it can utilize all available CPU cores.

## Real-World Example: Analyzing Weather Data

Let's look at a more practical example analyzing weather data:

```python
import dask.dataframe as dd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# In a real scenario, this could be hundreds of gigabytes of data
weather_data = dd.read_csv('https://github.com/plotly/datasets/raw/master/2015_06_30_precipitation.csv')

# Preview the data
print(weather_data.head())

# Calculate statistics across the entire dataset
stats = weather_data.describe().compute()
print("\nDataset statistics:")
print(stats)

# Find the top 10 locations with highest precipitation
top_rain = (weather_data
            .nlargest(10, 'Globvalue')
            .compute())

print("\nTop 10 locations with highest precipitation:")
print(top_rain)

# In a Jupyter notebook, you could visualize this data:
# plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
# plt.bar(top_rain['Station'], top_rain['Globvalue'])
# plt.xticks(rotation=90)
# plt.title('Top 10 Locations with Highest Precipitation')
# plt.ylabel('Precipitation')
# plt.tight_layout()
# plt.show()
```

This example demonstrates how Dask can be used for exploratory data analysis on large datasets, allowing you to calculate statistics, filter data, and prepare it for visualization.

## Best Practices When Using Dask with Pandas

1. **When to use Dask vs. Pandas:**
   - Use pandas for datasets that fit in memory (typically < 1-5 GB depending on your RAM)
   - Use Dask when your data is larger than memory or when you need parallelism

2. **Optimize partition size:**
   - Too many small partitions create overhead
   - Too few large partitions limit parallelism
   - A good rule of thumb is to aim for partitions of ~100MB each

3. **Minimize calls to `.compute()`:**
   ```python
   # Less efficient: multiple compute() calls
   result1 = ddf.column1.mean().compute()
   result2 = ddf.column2.sum().compute()
   
   # More efficient: single compute() call
   result1, result2 = dask.compute(ddf.column1.mean(), 
                                   ddf.column2.sum())
   ```

4. **Use persist() for intermediate results:**
   ```python
   # If you use a dataset multiple times
   ddf = dd.read_csv('large_data/*.csv')
   ddf = ddf[ddf.value > 0]  # Filter operation
   
   # Persist the filtered dataset in memory
   ddf = ddf.persist()
   
   # Now multiple operations will be faster
   result1 = ddf.groupby('category').mean().compute()
   result2 = ddf.value.std().compute()
   ```

## Limitations of Dask

While Dask is powerful, it's important to understand its limitations:

1. Not all pandas operations are supported or optimized in Dask
2. Dask adds overhead, so for smaller datasets, pandas may be faster
3. Operations that require shuffling data (like certain groupby operations) can be expensive
4. Dask is designed for batch processing, not for low-latency queries
