# Pandas Pickle Export

## Introduction

When working with data in Python, saving your processed DataFrames for later use is a common requirement. While CSV and Excel are popular formats, they have limitations—they don't preserve data types and can be inefficient for large datasets. This is where Python's **pickle** format comes in handy.

Pickle is a Python-specific data format that allows you to serialize and deserialize Python objects. When used with Pandas, it enables you to save DataFrames to disk and load them back exactly as they were—maintaining all data types, indexes, and even custom objects. This preservation of the exact state makes pickle an excellent choice for intermediate data storage in your Python data pipelines.

## Understanding Pickle Format

Pickle is a binary serialization format native to Python. Some key points about pickle:

- **Preserves Python objects**: Maintains all attributes, methods, and data types
- **Binary format**: More compact than text-based formats like CSV
- **Python-specific**: Files are not easily readable by other programming languages
- **Fast I/O operations**: Usually faster than text-based formats for reading/writing

## Basic Pickle Export with Pandas

Let's start with the basic syntax for saving a DataFrame to a pickle file:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Create a sample DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame({
    'A': [1, 2, 3, 4],
    'B': ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'],
    'C': np.random.randn(4),
    'D': pd.date_range('20230101', periods=4)
})

# Display the DataFrame
print("Original DataFrame:")
print(df)

# Save the DataFrame to pickle format
df.to_pickle('data.pkl')

print("\nDataFrame has been saved to 'data.pkl'")
```

Output:
```
Original DataFrame:
   A  B         C          D
0  1  a -0.494519 2023-01-01
1  2  b  0.048869 2023-01-02
2  3  c -0.562330 2023-01-03
3  4  d  1.720718 2023-01-04

DataFrame has been saved to 'data.pkl'
```

### Loading a Pickled DataFrame

To verify our export worked correctly, let's load the DataFrame back:

```python
# Load the DataFrame from the pickle file
loaded_df = pd.read_pickle('data.pkl')

# Display the loaded DataFrame
print("Loaded DataFrame:")
print(loaded_df)

# Check data types to confirm they're preserved
print("\nData Types:")
print(loaded_df.dtypes)
```

Output:
```
Loaded DataFrame:
   A  B         C          D
0  1  a -0.494519 2023-01-01
1  2  b  0.048869 2023-01-02
2  3  c -0.562330 2023-01-03
3  4  d  1.720718 2023-01-04

Data Types:
A             int64
B            object
C           float64
D    datetime64[ns]
dtype: object
```

Notice how all data types, including the datetime column, are preserved correctly.

## Advanced Pickle Options

### Compression

For large DataFrames, you can save space by compressing the pickle file:

```python
# Save with compression
df.to_pickle('data_compressed.pkl.gz', compression='gzip')

# Load compressed pickle file
df_compressed = pd.read_pickle('data_compressed.pkl.gz', compression='gzip')

# Check file sizes to see the difference
import os
print(f"Uncompressed size: {os.path.getsize('data.pkl')} bytes")
print(f"Compressed size: {os.path.getsize('data_compressed.pkl.gz')} bytes")
```

Output:
```
Uncompressed size: 456 bytes
Compressed size: 353 bytes
```

The compression ratio improves dramatically with larger DataFrames.

### Protocol Versions

Pickle offers different protocol versions that control compatibility and features:

```python
# Save with specific protocol version
df.to_pickle('data_protocol4.pkl', protocol=4)

# Default protocol (latest available)
df.to_pickle('data_default_protocol.pkl')
```

Protocol versions:
- **Protocols 0-2**: Compatible with both Python 2 and 3
- **Protocol 3**: Python 3 only, more efficient
- **Protocol 4**: Python 3.4+, supports larger objects
- **Protocol 5**: Python 3.8+, even more efficient for out-of-band data

Higher protocol versions generally offer better performance but may not be readable by older Python versions.

## Practical Example: Data Pipeline Checkpointing

A common use case for pickle is saving intermediate results in a data pipeline. Let's see an example:

```python
import pandas as pd
import time

# Simulate a multi-step data processing pipeline
def process_data():
    print("Step 1: Loading raw data...")
    # Simulated raw data
    df = pd.DataFrame({
        'customer_id': range(1000, 1010),
        'purchase_amount': [120, 55, 78, 34, 99, 150, 45, 230, 15, 89]
    })
    
    print("Step 2: Processing data...")
    # Add some processing steps
    df['tax'] = df['purchase_amount'] * 0.08
    df['total'] = df['purchase_amount'] + df['tax']
    
    # Save checkpoint after processing
    df.to_pickle('checkpoint_processed.pkl')
    print("Checkpoint saved after processing")
    
    print("Step 3: Performing time-consuming analysis...")
    # Simulate a long-running process
    time.sleep(2)
    df['category'] = ['A', 'B', 'A', 'C', 'B', 'A', 'A', 'B', 'C', 'B']
    df['discount'] = df['total'] * 0.05
    df['final_price'] = df['total'] - df['discount']
    
    print("Pipeline complete!")
    return df

# Run the pipeline
result = process_data()
print("\nFinal result:")
print(result.head())

print("\nDemo: resuming from checkpoint")
# Simulate resuming from checkpoint
checkpoint_df = pd.read_pickle('checkpoint_processed.pkl')
print("Loaded checkpoint data:")
print(checkpoint_df.head())
```

Output:
```
Step 1: Loading raw data...
Step 2: Processing data...
Checkpoint saved after processing
Step 3: Performing time-consuming analysis...
Pipeline complete!

Final result:
   customer_id  purchase_amount     tax    total category  discount  final_price
0         1000              120    9.60   129.60        A     6.480      123.12
1         1001               55    4.40    59.40        B     2.970       56.43
2         1002               78    6.24    84.24        A     4.212       80.03
3         1003               34    2.72    36.72        C     1.836       34.88
4         1004               99    7.92   106.92        B     5.346      101.57

Demo: resuming from checkpoint
Loaded checkpoint data:
   customer_id  purchase_amount    tax   total
0         1000              120   9.60  129.60
1         1001               55   4.40   59.40
2         1002               78   6.24   84.24
3         1003               34   2.72   36.72
4         1004               99   7.92  106.92
```

This demonstrates how you can use pickle files as checkpoints in a multi-stage data processing pipeline.

## Best Practices and Considerations

### When to Use Pickle

Pickle is best used when:
- You need to preserve exact Python objects, including data types
- Your data is only for Python applications
- You need fast I/O operations
- You're creating checkpoints in a data pipeline

### When Not to Use Pickle

Avoid pickle when:
- You need data interchange with other programming languages
- Long-term data archiving (pickle format may change between Python versions)
- Security is a concern (pickle can execute arbitrary code during unpickling)
- You need human-readable outputs

### Security Considerations

It's important to note that pickle files should only be loaded if you trust their source. Never unpickle data received from untrusted sources, as it can execute malicious code.

```python
# ⚠️ SECURITY RISK: Only load trusted pickle files
# df = pd.read_pickle('untrusted_file.pkl')  # Potentially dangerous
```

### Version Compatibility

Pickle files may not be compatible between different Python or pandas versions. For long-term storage, consider more stable formats like HDF5, Parquet, or even CSV with appropriate metadata.

## Summary

Pandas' pickle functionality provides a convenient way to serialize and deserialize DataFrames while preserving all their characteristics:

- Use `df.to_pickle(filename)` to save DataFrames
- Use `pd.read_pickle(filename)` to load them back
- Consider compression for large files
- Be aware of security implications
- Use pickle primarily for temporary storage, checkpointing, and within trusted environments

Pickle export is especially useful in data science workflows where you need to save intermediate processing results or transfer complex data structures between Python programs.

## Additional Resources and Exercises

- [Python's pickle module documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html)

### Exercises

1. Create a DataFrame with at least one column of each data type (integer, float, string, datetime, boolean), save it as a pickle file, and then load it back to verify all types are preserved.

2. Compare the file size and read/write speed between pickle, CSV, and Excel formats for a large DataFrame (e.g., 100,000 rows).

3. Create a multi-stage data processing pipeline that uses pickle files as checkpoints between each stage.

4. Implement error handling for your pickle loading code to safely handle cases where the file might not exist or might be from an incompatible pandas version.
