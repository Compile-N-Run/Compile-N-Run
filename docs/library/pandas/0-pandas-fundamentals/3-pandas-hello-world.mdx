# Pandas Hello World

## Introduction

Pandas is a powerful Python library for data manipulation and analysis. It's particularly well-suited for working with structured data like spreadsheets or SQL tables. If you're starting your journey into data science, data analysis, or just need to handle tabular data efficiently in Python, Pandas is an essential tool to learn.

In this "Hello World" tutorial, we'll cover the basics of Pandas, including:

- Installing Pandas
- Creating and understanding Pandas' core data structures
- Performing simple operations with Pandas
- Reading data from and writing data to files

By the end of this tutorial, you'll have a solid foundation to build upon as you learn more advanced Pandas concepts.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have:

- Python 3.6 or later installed
- Basic knowledge of Python programming
- A code editor or Jupyter Notebook environment

## Installing Pandas

Let's start by installing Pandas. Open your terminal or command prompt and run:

```bash
pip install pandas
```

If you're using Anaconda, you can install Pandas using:

```bash
conda install pandas
```

## Your First Pandas Program

Let's write a simple "Hello World" program using Pandas. First, we need to import the library:

```python
import pandas as pd
```

By convention, Pandas is imported with the alias `pd` to make the code more concise.

### Creating a Series

The simplest data structure in Pandas is the `Series`, which is essentially a one-dimensional labeled array. Let's create our first Series:

```python
# Creating a simple Series
s = pd.Series([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
print(s)
```

Output:
```
0    1
1    2
2    3
3    4
4    5
dtype: int64
```

The left side shows the index (0 to 4), and the right side shows the values. The `dtype` indicates that our Series contains 64-bit integers.

You can also create a Series with custom indices:

```python
# Creating a Series with custom indices
s = pd.Series([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], index=['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e'])
print(s)
```

Output:
```
a    1
b    2
c    3
d    4
e    5
dtype: int64
```

### Creating a DataFrame

A `DataFrame` is a 2-dimensional labeled data structure with columns of potentially different types. Think of it as a spreadsheet or SQL table. Let's create our first DataFrame:

```python
# Creating a DataFrame from a dictionary
data = {
    'Name': ['John', 'Anna', 'Peter', 'Linda'],
    'Age': [28, 24, 35, 32],
    'City': ['New York', 'Paris', 'Berlin', 'London']
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)
print(df)
```

Output:
```
    Name  Age      City
0   John   28  New York
1   Anna   24     Paris
2  Peter   35    Berlin
3  Linda   32    London
```

## Basic DataFrame Operations

Now that we've created a DataFrame, let's explore some basic operations.

### Viewing Data

To view the first few rows of a DataFrame, use the `head()` method:

```python
# View the first 3 rows
print(df.head(3))
```

Output:
```
    Name  Age      City
0   John   28  New York
1   Anna   24     Paris
2  Peter   35    Berlin
```

To view the last few rows, use the `tail()` method:

```python
# View the last 2 rows
print(df.tail(2))
```

Output:
```
    Name  Age    City
2  Peter   35  Berlin
3  Linda   32  London
```

### Getting Information About the DataFrame

To get a concise summary of your DataFrame, use the `info()` method:

```python
df.info()
```

Output:
```
<class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>
RangeIndex: 4 entries, 0 to 3
Data columns (total 3 columns):
 #   Column  Non-Null Count  Dtype 
---  ------  --------------  ----- 
 0   Name    4 non-null      object
 1   Age     4 non-null      int64 
 2   City    4 non-null      object
dtypes: int64(1), object(2)
memory usage: 224.0+ bytes
```

For numerical summaries, use the `describe()` method:

```python
print(df.describe())
```

Output:
```
             Age
count   4.000000
mean   29.750000
std     4.924429
min    24.000000
25%    27.000000
50%    30.000000
75%    32.750000
max    35.000000
```

### Accessing Data

There are multiple ways to access data in a DataFrame:

```python
# Accessing a column
print(df['Name'])
```

Output:
```
0     John
1     Anna
2    Peter
3    Linda
Name: Name, dtype: object
```

```python
# Accessing multiple columns
print(df[['Name', 'City']])
```

Output:
```
    Name      City
0   John  New York
1   Anna     Paris
2  Peter    Berlin
3  Linda    London
```

```python
# Accessing a row by index
print(df.loc[1])
```

Output:
```
Name    Anna
Age       24
City    Paris
Name: 1, dtype: object
```

```python
# Accessing a specific cell
print(df.loc[2, 'Name'])
```

Output:
```
Peter
```

### Adding and Modifying Data

You can add new columns to a DataFrame:

```python
# Adding a new column
df['Country'] = ['USA', 'France', 'Germany', 'UK']
print(df)
```

Output:
```
    Name  Age      City  Country
0   John   28  New York      USA
1   Anna   24     Paris   France
2  Peter   35    Berlin  Germany
3  Linda   32    London       UK
```

Or modify existing data:

```python
# Modifying values
df.loc[0, 'Age'] = 29
print(df)
```

Output:
```
    Name  Age      City  Country
0   John   29  New York      USA
1   Anna   24     Paris   France
2  Peter   35    Berlin  Germany
3  Linda   32    London       UK
```

## Reading and Writing Data

One of the most common operations in Pandas is reading data from files.

### Reading CSV Data

Let's create a sample CSV file and read it using Pandas:

```python
# Creating a CSV file
df.to_csv('people_data.csv', index=False)

# Reading the CSV file
new_df = pd.read_csv('people_data.csv')
print(new_df)
```

Output:
```
    Name  Age      City  Country
0   John   29  New York      USA
1   Anna   24     Paris   France
2  Peter   35    Berlin  Germany
3  Linda   32    London       UK
```

### Other File Formats

Pandas can work with many other file formats:

```python
# Excel files
df.to_excel('people_data.xlsx', index=False)
excel_df = pd.read_excel('people_data.xlsx')

# JSON files
df.to_json('people_data.json')
json_df = pd.read_json('people_data.json')
```

## Real-World Example: Data Analysis

Let's use a real-world dataset to demonstrate a simple analysis with Pandas. We'll create a small dataset of product sales:

```python
# Creating a sales dataset
sales_data = {
    'Date': pd.date_range(start='2023-01-01', periods=10, freq='D'),
    'Product': ['A', 'B', 'A', 'C', 'B', 'A', 'C', 'B', 'A', 'C'],
    'Quantity': [10, 15, 12, 8, 20, 25, 15, 18, 22, 16],
    'Price': [100, 200, 100, 150, 200, 100, 150, 200, 100, 150]
}

sales_df = pd.DataFrame(sales_data)
print(sales_df)
```

Output:
```
        Date Product  Quantity  Price
0 2023-01-01       A        10    100
1 2023-01-02       B        15    200
2 2023-01-03       A        12    100
3 2023-01-04       C         8    150
4 2023-01-05       B        20    200
5 2023-01-06       A        25    100
6 2023-01-07       C        15    150
7 2023-01-08       B        18    200
8 2023-01-09       A        22    100
9 2023-01-10       C        16    150
```

Now, let's calculate the total sales amount:

```python
# Calculate total sales amount
sales_df['Total'] = sales_df['Quantity'] * sales_df['Price']
print(sales_df)
```

Output:
```
        Date Product  Quantity  Price  Total
0 2023-01-01       A        10    100   1000
1 2023-01-02       B        15    200   3000
2 2023-01-03       A        12    100   1200
3 2023-01-04       C         8    150   1200
4 2023-01-05       B        20    200   4000
5 2023-01-06       A        25    100   2500
6 2023-01-07       C        15    150   2250
7 2023-01-08       B        18    200   3600
8 2023-01-09       A        22    100   2200
9 2023-01-10       C        16    150   2400
```

Let's find the total sales by product:

```python
# Group by Product and calculate sum
product_sales = sales_df.groupby('Product')['Total'].sum()
print(product_sales)
```

Output:
```
Product
A    6900
B   10600
C    5850
Name: Total, dtype: int64
```

And visualize it:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

product_sales.plot(kind='bar')
plt.title('Total Sales by Product')
plt.ylabel('Total Sales ($)')
plt.xlabel('Product')
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

This would display a bar chart showing the total sales for each product.
