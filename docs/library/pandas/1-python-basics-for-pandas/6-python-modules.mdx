# Python Modules

## Introduction

When you start writing more complex Python programs, organizing your code becomes increasingly important. Python **modules** provide a way to organize related code into separate files that can be reused across different programs. This concept is fundamental to writing maintainable code and is extensively used in libraries like Pandas.

In this lesson, we'll explore what Python modules are, how to use them, and how to create your own modules.

## What are Python Modules?

A Python module is simply a `.py` file containing Python definitions and statements. The module name is the filename without the `.py` extension. Modules allow you to logically organize your Python code, making it more manageable and reusable.

Python comes with a rich standard library of modules that you can use right away, such as `math`, `datetime`, `random`, and many more.

## How to Import Modules

To use the functionality provided by a module, you first need to import it into your program.

### Basic Import

```python
import math

# Now we can use functions from the math module
radius = 5
area = math.pi * math.pow(radius, 2)
print(f"The area of a circle with radius {radius} is {area}")
```

Output:
```
The area of a circle with radius 5 is 78.53981633974483
```

### Import Specific Functions or Variables

You can import specific items from a module:

```python
from math import pi, sqrt

radius = 5
area = pi * radius**2
print(f"The area of a circle with radius {radius} is {area}")
print(f"The square root of 16 is {sqrt(16)}")
```

Output:
```
The area of a circle with radius 5 is 78.53981633974483
The square root of 16 is 4.0
```

### Import with an Alias

You can give a module a different name (alias) when importing:

```python
import math as m

radius = 5
area = m.pi * m.pow(radius, 2)
print(f"The area of a circle with radius {radius} is {area}")
```

Output:
```
The area of a circle with radius 5 is 78.53981633974483
```

### Import Everything from a Module

You can import all functions and variables from a module using the `*` wildcard, but this is generally discouraged as it can lead to naming conflicts:

```python
from math import *

radius = 5
area = pi * pow(radius, 2)  # Notice no 'math.' prefix
print(f"The area of a circle with radius {radius} is {area}")
```

Output:
```
The area of a circle with radius 5 is 78.53981633974483
```

## Creating Your Own Modules

Creating your own module is as simple as creating a Python file with the functions and variables you want to include.

Let's create a simple module for calculation functions:

1. Create a file named `calculator.py`:

```python
# calculator.py
def add(x, y):
    """Add two numbers and return the result."""
    return x + y

def subtract(x, y):
    """Subtract y from x and return the result."""
    return x - y

def multiply(x, y):
    """Multiply two numbers and return the result."""
    return x * y

def divide(x, y):
    """Divide x by y and return the result."""
    if y == 0:
        raise ValueError("Cannot divide by zero!")
    return x / y

# A constant in our module
PI = 3.14159
```

2. Now, we can use this module in another Python script:

```python
import calculator

result1 = calculator.add(10, 5)
result2 = calculator.subtract(10, 5)
result3 = calculator.multiply(10, 5)
result4 = calculator.divide(10, 5)

print(f"Addition: {result1}")
print(f"Subtraction: {result2}")
print(f"Multiplication: {result3}")
print(f"Division: {result4}")
print(f"PI value from module: {calculator.PI}")
```

Output:
```
Addition: 15
Subtraction: 5
Multiplication: 50
Division: 2.0
PI value from module: 3.14159
```

## Module Search Path

When you import a module, Python looks for it in several locations:

1. The current directory
2. Directories in the `PYTHONPATH` environment variable
3. Standard library directories
4. Directories listed in `.pth` files
5. Site-packages directory for third-party packages

You can see the list of directories Python searches by:

```python
import sys
print(sys.path)
```

## The `dir()` Function

The built-in `dir()` function can be used to find out which names a module defines:

```python
import math
print(dir(math))
```

Output (partial):
```
['__doc__', '__file__', '__loader__', '__name__', '__package__', '__spec__', 'acos', 'acosh', 'asin', 'asinh', 'atan', 'atan2', 'atanh', 'ceil', 'comb', 'copysign', 'cos', 'cosh', 'degrees', 'dist', 'e', 'erf', 'erfc', 'exp', 'expm1', 'fabs', 'factorial', 'floor', 'fmod', 'frexp', 'fsum', 'gamma', 'gcd', 'hypot', 'inf', 'isclose', 'isfinite', 'isinf', 'isnan', 'isqrt', 'lcm', 'ldexp', 'lgamma', 'log', 'log10', 'log1p', 'log2', 'modf', 'nan', 'nextafter', 'perm', 'pi', 'pow', 'prod', 'radians', 'remainder', 'sin', 'sinh', 'sqrt', 'tan', 'tanh', 'tau', 'trunc', 'ulp']
```

## Packages: Organizing Modules

As your codebase grows, you might want to organize related modules into packages. A package is a directory that contains multiple Python modules and a special `__init__.py` file.

Here's a simple package structure:

```
my_package/
    __init__.py
    module1.py
    module2.py
    subpackage/
        __init__.py
        module3.py
```

You can import modules from this package as follows:

```python
import my_package.module1
from my_package import module2
from my_package.subpackage import module3
```

## Real-World Example: Data Analysis

Modules are extensively used in data analysis with libraries like Pandas. Here's a simple example of how you might structure data analysis code using modules:

1. Create a file named `data_loader.py`:

```python
# data_loader.py
import csv

def load_csv(filename):
    """Load data from a CSV file into a list of dictionaries."""
    data = []
    with open(filename, 'r') as file:
        csv_reader = csv.DictReader(file)
        for row in csv_reader:
            data.append(row)
    return data
```

2. Create a file named `data_analysis.py`:

```python
# data_analysis.py
def calculate_average(data, column):
    """Calculate the average of a numeric column in the data."""
    total = 0
    count = 0
    for row in data:
        try:
            value = float(row[column])
            total += value
            count += 1
        except (ValueError, KeyError):
            pass
    
    if count == 0:
        return 0
    return total / count
```

3. Create a main script that uses these modules:

```python
# main.py
from data_loader import load_csv
from data_analysis import calculate_average

# Load the data
data = load_csv("sales_data.csv")

# Calculate average sales
avg_sales = calculate_average(data, "sales_amount")
print(f"Average sales: ${avg_sales:.2f}")
```

This modular approach makes your code more maintainable and easier to test.

## Importance for Pandas

Understanding modules is crucial for working with Pandas because:

1. Pandas itself is a module that you need to import into your programs.
2. Pandas often works together with other modules like NumPy, Matplotlib, or SciPy.
3. As your data analysis projects grow, organizing your code into modules will help keep it manageable.

Here's how you typically import and use Pandas:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Create a DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame({
    'A': np.random.rand(5),
    'B': np.random.rand(5)
})

print(df)

# Create a simple plot
df.plot(kind='bar')
plt.title('Random Data')
plt.show()
```
