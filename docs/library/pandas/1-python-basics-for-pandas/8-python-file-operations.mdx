# Python File Operations

## Introduction

Working with files is a fundamental skill in programming. When working with data analysis libraries like pandas, understanding Python's file operations is essential since most data science projects involve reading from or writing to files. This guide will introduce you to the basics of file handling in Python, preparing you for more advanced data operations with pandas.

File operations allow you to:
- Read data from external sources
- Save the results of your analysis
- Process data that's too large to fit in memory at once
- Persist information between program executions

## Basic File Operations in Python

Python provides built-in functions to work with files. The most common operations are opening, reading, writing, and closing files.

### Opening Files

The `open()` function is used to open files in Python:

```python
file = open("example.txt", "r")
```

The `open()` function takes two main parameters:
- The file path (required)
- The mode (optional, default is "r" for read)

Common file modes include:

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| "r"  | Read (default) - Opens a file for reading |
| "w"  | Write - Opens a file for writing; creates a new file or truncates an existing one |
| "a"  | Append - Opens a file for appending content |
| "r+" | Read and Write - Opens a file for both reading and writing |
| "b"  | Binary mode (used with other modes like "rb" or "wb") |

### Reading from Files

Once a file is opened, you can read its contents in several ways:

```python
# Read entire file as a single string
file = open("example.txt", "r")
content = file.read()
print(content)
file.close()

# Read line by line
file = open("example.txt", "r")
line = file.readline()  # Read a single line
print(line)

lines = file.readlines()  # Read all lines into a list
print(lines)
file.close()
```

### The `with` Statement (Context Manager)

A better way to handle files is using the `with` statement, which automatically closes the file when the block ends:

```python
with open("example.txt", "r") as file:
    content = file.read()
    print(content)
# File is automatically closed here
```

Using the `with` statement is highly recommended as it ensures proper file handling even if exceptions occur.

### Writing to Files

To write to files, use the "w" or "a" mode:

```python
# Write mode (creates a new file or overwrites existing one)
with open("output.txt", "w") as file:
    file.write("Hello, world!\n")
    file.write("This is a new line.")
    
# Append mode (adds to existing content)
with open("output.txt", "a") as file:
    file.write("\nThis line is appended.")
```

If we run the code above and then check the contents of "output.txt", we would see:

```
Hello, world!
This is a new line.
This line is appended.
```

### Handling File Paths

Python's `os` module provides functions to work with file paths across different operating systems:

```python
import os

# Join path components correctly for your OS
file_path = os.path.join("data", "input", "example.txt")
print(file_path)  # On Windows: "data\input\example.txt", on Unix: "data/input/example.txt"

# Check if file exists
if os.path.exists(file_path):
    print(f"The file {file_path} exists")
else:
    print(f"The file {file_path} does not exist")
```

## Working with Different File Types

### CSV Files

CSV (Comma-Separated Values) files are common in data analysis. While pandas is ideal for CSV files, you can also use Python's built-in `csv` module:

```python
import csv

# Writing to CSV
with open("data.csv", "w", newline="") as csvfile:
    writer = csv.writer(csvfile)
    writer.writerow(["Name", "Age", "City"])
    writer.writerow(["Alice", 25, "New York"])
    writer.writerow(["Bob", 30, "San Francisco"])

# Reading from CSV
with open("data.csv", "r") as csvfile:
    reader = csv.reader(csvfile)
    for row in reader:
        print(row)
```

Output:
```
['Name', 'Age', 'City']
['Alice', '25', 'New York']
['Bob', '30', 'San Francisco']
```

### JSON Files

JSON is another common data format. Python's `json` module makes it easy to work with JSON files:

```python
import json

# Data to write
data = {
    "name": "John",
    "age": 30,
    "city": "New York",
    "languages": ["Python", "JavaScript", "Go"]
}

# Writing JSON to file
with open("data.json", "w") as jsonfile:
    json.dump(data, jsonfile, indent=4)

# Reading JSON from file
with open("data.json", "r") as jsonfile:
    loaded_data = json.load(jsonfile)
    print(loaded_data)
    print(f"Name: {loaded_data['name']}")
    print(f"Languages: {', '.join(loaded_data['languages'])}")
```

Output:
```
{'name': 'John', 'age': 30, 'city': 'New York', 'languages': ['Python', 'JavaScript', 'Go']}
Name: John
Languages: Python, JavaScript, Go
```

### Binary Files

For binary data (like images), use binary modes:

```python
# Reading a binary file (like an image)
with open("image.jpg", "rb") as binary_file:
    binary_data = binary_file.read()
    print(f"File size: {len(binary_data)} bytes")
    
# Creating a copy of the binary file
with open("image_copy.jpg", "wb") as copy_file:
    copy_file.write(binary_data)
```

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: Log File Analysis

Let's analyze a simple log file to count error occurrences:

```python
# Create a sample log file
log_content = """
2023-05-01 10:15:32 INFO System started
2023-05-01 10:16:45 ERROR Database connection failed
2023-05-01 10:17:02 INFO Retry connection
2023-05-01 10:17:15 INFO Connection established
2023-05-01 10:20:30 WARNING Slow response time
2023-05-01 10:25:12 ERROR Query timeout
"""

with open("system.log", "w") as logfile:
    logfile.write(log_content)

# Analyze the log file
error_count = 0
warning_count = 0
info_count = 0

with open("system.log", "r") as logfile:
    for line in logfile:
        if "ERROR" in line:
            error_count += 1
            print(f"Error found: {line.strip()}")
        elif "WARNING" in line:
            warning_count += 1
        elif "INFO" in line:
            info_count += 1

print(f"Log Analysis Results:")
print(f"Errors: {error_count}")
print(f"Warnings: {warning_count}")
print(f"Info: {info_count}")
```

Output:
```
Error found: 2023-05-01 10:16:45 ERROR Database connection failed
Error found: 2023-05-01 10:25:12 ERROR Query timeout
Log Analysis Results:
Errors: 2
Warnings: 1
Info: 3
```

### Example 2: Data Processing Pipeline

This example shows how to read data, process it, and write the results to a new file:

```python
# Sample data - student scores
with open("student_scores.txt", "w") as f:
    f.write("Alice,85,90,92\n")
    f.write("Bob,76,88,80\n")
    f.write("Charlie,92,95,88\n")
    f.write("Diana,95,89,91\n")

# Process the data to calculate averages
with open("student_scores.txt", "r") as input_file, open("student_averages.txt", "w") as output_file:
    output_file.write("Name,Average\n")
    
    for line in input_file:
        parts = line.strip().split(",")
        name = parts[0]
        scores = [int(score) for score in parts[1:]]
        average = sum(scores) / len(scores)
        
        output_file.write(f"{name},{average:.2f}\n")
        print(f"Processed {name}'s scores. Average: {average:.2f}")

# Display the results
print("\nContents of student_averages.txt:")
with open("student_averages.txt", "r") as result_file:
    print(result_file.read())
```

Output:
```
Processed Alice's scores. Average: 89.00
Processed Bob's scores. Average: 81.33
Processed Charlie's scores. Average: 91.67
Processed Diana's scores. Average: 91.67

Contents of student_averages.txt:
Name,Average
Alice,89.00
Bob,81.33
Charlie,91.67
Diana,91.67
```

## File Operations and Pandas

While we're learning basic Python file operations, it's worth noting that pandas provides powerful functions to read and write various file formats:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Instead of manual CSV parsing
df = pd.read_csv("data.csv")
print(df.head())

# Save DataFrame to CSV
df.to_csv("processed_data.csv", index=False)
```

Understanding the underlying Python file operations will help you better utilize these pandas functions and handle situations where you need more customized file processing.

## Common File Operation Errors

1. **FileNotFoundError**: Occurs when trying to open a file that doesn't exist
2. **PermissionError**: Happens when you don't have permission to access a file
3. **IOError**: General input/output error
4. **UnicodeDecodeError**: Can occur when reading files with incompatible encoding

Example of error handling:

```python
try:
    with open("missing_file.txt", "r") as file:
        content = file.read()
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("The file doesn't exist!")
except PermissionError:
    print("You don't have permission to access this file!")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
```

## Summary

File operations are a fundamental part of Python programming, especially in data analysis:

- Use `open()` to access files with different modes ("r", "w", "a")
- Always use the `with` statement for proper file handling
- Python offers specialized modules for specific file formats (csv, json)
- Error handling is important when working with files
- Understanding file operations will provide a strong foundation for working with pandas

These skills will be directly applicable when you start using pandas for data analysis, as most data science workflows involve reading, processing, and writing data files.
