# TensorFlow Monitoring

## Introduction

When training machine learning models, especially in distributed environments, monitoring becomes crucial to ensure that your training is progressing correctly, efficiently, and without errors. TensorFlow provides several tools and techniques for monitoring your distributed training jobs, helping you track performance metrics, identify bottlenecks, and diagnose issues.

In this tutorial, we'll explore various approaches to monitoring TensorFlow distributed training jobs, including built-in TensorFlow features, TensorBoard visualization, and custom monitoring solutions.

## Why Monitoring Matters in Distributed Training

Before diving into the technical details, let's understand why monitoring is particularly important for distributed training:

1. **Resource Utilization**: Distributed training often involves multiple GPUs, TPUs, or machines, making it critical to ensure all resources are properly utilized.
2. **Performance Bottlenecks**: Identifying and resolving bottlenecks can significantly speed up training times.
3. **Convergence Tracking**: Monitoring loss and accuracy metrics helps ensure the model is learning effectively.
4. **Communication Overhead**: In distributed settings, the communication between workers can become a bottleneck.
5. **Fault Detection**: Early detection of failed nodes or processes can save time and resources.

## Basic Monitoring with TensorFlow Callbacks

TensorFlow's Keras API provides several built-in callbacks that can help monitor your training. Let's start with some simple examples:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Create a simple model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

model.compile(
    optimizer='adam',
    loss='binary_crossentropy',
    metrics=['accuracy']
)

# Create some dummy data
import numpy as np
x_train = np.random.random((1000, 10))
y_train = np.random.randint(2, size=(1000, 1))
x_val = np.random.random((200, 10))
y_val = np.random.randint(2, size=(200, 1))

# Define callbacks for monitoring
callbacks = [
    # Print training metrics after each epoch
    tf.keras.callbacks.ProgbarLogger(count_mode='steps'),
    
    # Early stopping if validation loss doesn't improve
    tf.keras.callbacks.EarlyStopping(
        monitor='val_loss', 
        patience=3,
        verbose=1
    ),
    
    # Save model checkpoints
    tf.keras.callbacks.ModelCheckpoint(
        filepath='./model_checkpoints/model_{epoch:02d}_{val_loss:.2f}.h5',
        monitor='val_loss',
        save_best_only=True,
        verbose=1
    )
]

# Train the model with callbacks
history = model.fit(
    x_train, y_train,
    epochs=10,
    batch_size=32,
    validation_data=(x_val, y_val),
    callbacks=callbacks
)
```

**Output:**
```
Epoch 1/10
32/32 [==============================] - 1s 5ms/step - loss: 0.6931 - accuracy: 0.5040 - val_loss: 0.6920 - val_accuracy: 0.5050
Epoch 2/10
32/32 [==============================] - 0s 3ms/step - loss: 0.6917 - accuracy: 0.5160 - val_loss: 0.6902 - val_accuracy: 0.5150
...
Epoch 5/10
32/32 [==============================] - 0s 3ms/step - loss: 0.6873 - accuracy: 0.5380 - val_loss: 0.6905 - val_accuracy: 0.5300
Epoch 00005: val_loss improved from 0.6902 to 0.6883, saving model to ./model_checkpoints/model_05_0.69.h5
...
```

### Custom Callbacks for Distributed Training Metrics

For distributed training, you might want to track additional metrics specific to distribution strategy. Here's how to create a custom callback:

```python
class DistributedTrainingCallback(tf.keras.callbacks.Callback):
    def __init__(self):
        super(DistributedTrainingCallback, self).__init__()
        self.batch_times = []
        self.epoch_times = []
        self.current_batch_start_time = None
        self.current_epoch_start_time = None
        
    def on_epoch_begin(self, epoch, logs=None):
        self.current_epoch_start_time = time.time()
        print(f"\nEpoch {epoch+1} starting...")
        
    def on_epoch_end(self, epoch, logs=None):
        epoch_time = time.time() - self.current_epoch_start_time
        self.epoch_times.append(epoch_time)
        print(f"Epoch {epoch+1} completed in {epoch_time:.2f} seconds")
        print(f"Average batch time: {np.mean(self.batch_times):.4f} seconds")
        self.batch_times = []  # Reset for next epoch
        
    def on_train_batch_begin(self, batch, logs=None):
        self.current_batch_start_time = time.time()
        
    def on_train_batch_end(self, batch, logs=None):
        batch_time = time.time() - self.current_batch_start_time
        self.batch_times.append(batch_time)
        if batch % 50 == 0:  # Print every 50 batches
            print(f"  Batch {batch}: {batch_time:.4f} seconds")
```

## Monitoring with TensorBoard

TensorBoard is TensorFlow's visualization toolkit, which is extremely useful for monitoring distributed training. Let's see how to use it:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import datetime

# Prepare the same model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

model.compile(
    optimizer='adam',
    loss='binary_crossentropy',
    metrics=['accuracy']
)

# Prepare some dummy data
import numpy as np
x_train = np.random.random((1000, 10))
y_train = np.random.randint(2, size=(1000, 1))
x_val = np.random.random((200, 10))
y_val = np.random.randint(2, size=(200, 1))

# Set up TensorBoard callback
log_dir = "logs/fit/" + datetime.datetime.now().strftime("%Y%m%d-%H%M%S")
tensorboard_callback = tf.keras.callbacks.TensorBoard(
    log_dir=log_dir,
    histogram_freq=1,  # Log histogram of weights every epoch
    profile_batch='500,520',  # Profile from batch 500 to 520
    update_freq='epoch'  # Update metrics after each epoch
)

# Train the model with TensorBoard
history = model.fit(
    x_train, y_train,
    epochs=10,
    batch_size=32,
    validation_data=(x_val, y_val),
    callbacks=[tensorboard_callback]
)

print("Training completed. Run the following command to start TensorBoard:")
print(f"tensorboard --logdir {log_dir}")
```

After training, you can run TensorBoard from your command line and access it through your web browser (typically at http://localhost:6006).

### Key TensorBoard Features for Distributed Training

1. **Scalars**: Track metrics like loss and accuracy over time.
2. **Graphs**: Visualize your model architecture.
3. **Distributions and Histograms**: Monitor weight and gradient distributions.
4. **Profiler**: Analyze performance bottlenecks.
5. **HParams**: Track hyperparameter effectiveness.

## Advanced Monitoring for Distributed Training

When working with more complex distributed training setups, additional monitoring becomes necessary.

### Monitoring Resource Utilization

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import psutil
import GPUtil
import time

class ResourceMonitor(tf.keras.callbacks.Callback):
    def __init__(self, log_frequency=5):
        super(ResourceMonitor, self).__init__()
        self.log_frequency = log_frequency
        self.step_counter = 0
        
    def on_train_batch_end(self, batch, logs=None):
        if self.step_counter % self.log_frequency == 0:
            # CPU Usage
            cpu_percent = psutil.cpu_percent(interval=0.1)
            # RAM Usage
            ram_percent = psutil.virtual_memory().percent
            # GPU Stats (if available)
            try:
                gpus = GPUtil.getGPUs()
                gpu_usage = [gpu.load*100 for gpu in gpus]
                gpu_memory = [gpu.memoryUtil*100 for gpu in gpus]
                gpu_str = " | ".join([f"GPU-{i} Usage: {u:.1f}%, Mem: {m:.1f}%" 
                                    for i, (u, m) in enumerate(zip(gpu_usage, gpu_memory))])
            except:
                gpu_str = "No GPU info available"
                
            print(f"Step {self.step_counter} - CPU: {cpu_percent:.1f}% | RAM: {ram_percent:.1f}% | {gpu_str}")
        self.step_counter += 1
```

### Monitoring a Multi-Worker Distributed Setup

When running training across multiple machines, you'll want to monitor each worker. Here's a basic example of setting up such monitoring:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import json
import os

# Define your model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
])

# Define distribution strategy based on TF_CONFIG
tf_config = json.loads(os.environ.get('TF_CONFIG', '{}'))
if tf_config:
    print(f"Worker {tf_config['task']['index']} in cluster starting training...")
    
    # Multi-worker settings
    strategy = tf.distribute.MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy()
    
    with strategy.scope():
        model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')

    # Create worker-specific logs directory
    worker_index = tf_config['task']['index']
    log_dir = f"logs/worker_{worker_index}/{datetime.datetime.now().strftime('%Y%m%d-%H%M%S')}"
    
    callbacks = [
        tf.keras.callbacks.TensorBoard(log_dir=log_dir),
        ResourceMonitor()
    ]
    
    # Train the model
    model.fit(x_train, y_train, 
              epochs=10, 
              callbacks=callbacks)
else:
    print("Running in single-worker mode...")
    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
    model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10)
```

## Practical Example: Monitoring a Distributed Image Classification Model

Let's build a more comprehensive example using a real dataset and monitoring the training across multiple workers:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
import json
import os
import time
import datetime

# Load CIFAR-10 dataset
(x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = tf.keras.datasets.cifar10.load_data()
x_train, x_test = x_train / 255.0, x_test / 255.0  # Normalize

# Create a function to build the model
def create_model():
    model = tf.keras.Sequential([
        tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, 3, activation='relu', input_shape=(32, 32, 3)),
        tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D(),
        tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(64, 3, activation='relu'),
        tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D(),
        tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(64, 3, activation='relu'),
        tf.keras.layers.Flatten(),
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(10)
    ])
    return model

# Create a training monitoring callback
class TrainingMonitor(tf.keras.callbacks.Callback):
    def __init__(self, worker_name="worker"):
        super(TrainingMonitor, self).__init__()
        self.worker_name = worker_name
        self.start_time = time.time()
        self.batch_times = []
        
    def on_train_batch_end(self, batch, logs=None):
        if batch % 100 == 0:
            elapsed = time.time() - self.start_time
            examples_per_second = ((batch + 1) * logs['batch_size']) / elapsed
            print(f"{self.worker_name} - Batch {batch} - "
                  f"loss: {logs['loss']:.4f} - "
                  f"examples/sec: {examples_per_second:.1f}")
    
    def on_epoch_end(self, epoch, logs=None):
        print(f"{self.worker_name} - Epoch {epoch+1} - "
              f"loss: {logs['loss']:.4f} - "
              f"accuracy: {logs['accuracy']:.4f} - "
              f"val_loss: {logs['val_loss']:.4f} - "
              f"val_accuracy: {logs['val_accuracy']:.4f}")

# Check if running in distributed mode
tf_config = json.loads(os.environ.get('TF_CONFIG', '{}'))
if tf_config:
    # Running in distributed mode
    strategy = tf.distribute.MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy()
    
    worker_name = f"Worker {tf_config['task']['index']}"
    log_dir = f"logs/dist_cifar10/{worker_name}/{datetime.datetime.now().strftime('%Y%m%d-%H%M%S')}"
    
    # Create and compile the model within strategy scope
    with strategy.scope():
        model = create_model()
        model.compile(
            optimizer=tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.001),
            loss=tf.keras.losses.SparseCategoricalCrossentropy(from_logits=True),
            metrics=['accuracy']
        )
else:
    # Running in single-worker mode
    worker_name = "SingleWorker"
    log_dir = f"logs/dist_cifar10/single/{datetime.datetime.now().strftime('%Y%m%d-%H%M%S')}"
    
    model = create_model()
    model.compile(
        optimizer=tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.001),
        loss=tf.keras.losses.SparseCategoricalCrossentropy(from_logits=True),
        metrics=['accuracy']
    )

# Create callbacks
callbacks = [
    TrainingMonitor(worker_name),
    tf.keras.callbacks.TensorBoard(
        log_dir=log_dir,
        profile_batch='500,520',
        update_freq='epoch'
    ),
    tf.keras.callbacks.ModelCheckpoint(
        filepath=os.path.join(log_dir, 'model_checkpoint_{epoch}'),
        save_best_only=True,
        monitor='val_accuracy'
    )
]

# Train the model
print(f"{worker_name} starting training...")
model.fit(
    x_train, y_train,
    batch_size=64,
    epochs=10,
    validation_data=(x_test, y_test),
    callbacks=callbacks
)

print(f"{worker_name} completed training!")
print(f"Logs saved to: {log_dir}")
```

### Running the Distributed Training

To run this distributed training example across multiple workers, you'd need to:

1. Set up the `TF_CONFIG` environment variable for each worker
2. Start the training script on each machine

For example, on worker 0 (chief):
```bash
TF_CONFIG='{"cluster": {"worker": ["worker0.example.com:12345", "worker1.example.com:12345"]}, "task": {"type": "worker", "index": 0}}' python train_cifar10.py
```

On worker 1:
```bash
TF_CONFIG='{"cluster": {"worker": ["worker0.example.com:12345", "worker1.example.com:12345"]}, "task": {"type": "worker", "index": 1}}' python train_cifar10.py
```

## Using TensorFlow Profiler for Performance Analysis

TensorFlow Profiler is a powerful tool for identifying performance bottlenecks in your distributed training:

```python
# Install TensorFlow Profiler (if needed)
# pip install -U tensorboard_plugin_profile

import tensorflow as tf

# Enable profiling
tf.profiler.experimental.start('logdir')

# Run your training code here
# ...

# Stop profiling
tf.profiler.experimental.stop()
```

Then view the profiling results in TensorBoard:
```bash
tensorboard --logdir=logdir
```

Navigate to the "Profile" tab to see detailed performance analysis including:
- GPU kernel performance
- Memory usage
- Input pipeline bottlenecks
- Operator statistics
- Model architecture

## Best Practices for Monitoring Distributed TensorFlow Training

1. **Monitor All Workers**: Ensure you're collecting metrics from all workers, not just the chief.
2. **Track Resource Utilization**: Keep an eye on CPU, memory, network, and GPU utilization.
3. **Log Critical Metrics**: Always track loss, accuracy, learning rate, and gradient norms.
4. **Use Profiling Sparingly**: Profiling adds overhead, so use it for targeted time periods.
5. **Visualize Distribution Metrics**: Pay attention to throughput (examples/second) across workers.
6. **Set Up Alerts**: Implement alerts for training stalls, divergence, or worker failures.
7. **Checkpoint Regularly**: Ensure models are saved frequently to recover from failures.
8. **Compare Scaling Efficiency**: Measure how throughput scales with worker count.
