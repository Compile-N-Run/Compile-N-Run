# TensorFlow Shape Manipulation

When working with TensorFlow, understanding how to manipulate the shape of your tensors is crucial. Shape manipulation allows you to restructure your data to match the requirements of different layers in neural networks, perform batch processing, and transform data between different representations.

## Introduction to Tensor Shapes

In TensorFlow, every tensor has a shape that defines its dimensions. The shape is represented as a tuple of integers, where each integer represents the size of a dimension.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Create a simple tensor
scalar = tf.constant(5)
vector = tf.constant([1, 2, 3, 4])
matrix = tf.constant([[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]])
tensor3d = tf.constant([[[1, 2], [3, 4]], [[5, 6], [7, 8]]])

# Print the shapes
print(f"Scalar shape: {scalar.shape}")
print(f"Vector shape: {vector.shape}")
print(f"Matrix shape: {matrix.shape}")
print(f"3D tensor shape: {tensor3d.shape}")
```

Output:
```
Scalar shape: ()
Vector shape: (4,)
Matrix shape: (3, 2)
3D tensor shape: (2, 2, 2)
```

Understanding these shapes is essential before we start manipulating them.

## Common Shape Manipulation Operations

### 1. Reshaping Tensors with `tf.reshape`

The most common shape manipulation operation is reshaping, which changes the dimensions of a tensor without changing its data.

```python
# Create a 6-element tensor
tensor = tf.constant([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])
print(f"Original tensor: {tensor}")
print(f"Original shape: {tensor.shape}")

# Reshape to a 2x3 matrix
reshaped = tf.reshape(tensor, [2, 3])
print(f"Reshaped tensor:\n{reshaped}")
print(f"New shape: {reshaped.shape}")

# Reshape to a 3x2 matrix
reshaped2 = tf.reshape(tensor, [3, 2])
print(f"Another reshape:\n{reshaped2}")
print(f"New shape: {reshaped2.shape}")
```

Output:
```
Original tensor: [1 2 3 4 5 6]
Original shape: (6,)
Reshaped tensor:
[[1 2 3]
 [4 5 6]]
New shape: (2, 3)
Another reshape:
[[1 2]
 [3 4]
 [5 6]]
New shape: (3, 2)
```

The total number of elements must remain the same when reshaping.

#### Using `-1` in Reshaping

You can use `-1` as one dimension in `tf.reshape()` to automatically calculate that dimension's size:

```python
tensor = tf.constant([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])

# TensorFlow will calculate the first dimension as 2
auto_reshape = tf.reshape(tensor, [-1, 3])
print(f"Auto-reshaped tensor:\n{auto_reshape}")
print(f"Auto-reshaped shape: {auto_reshape.shape}")
```

Output:
```
Auto-reshaped tensor:
[[1 2 3]
 [4 5 6]]
Auto-reshaped shape: (2, 3)
```

### 2. Changing Dimensions with `tf.expand_dims` and `tf.squeeze`

#### Adding Dimensions with `tf.expand_dims`

This adds a dimension of size 1 to a tensor:

```python
vector = tf.constant([1, 2, 3, 4])
print(f"Vector shape: {vector.shape}")

# Add dimension at index 0 (convert to a batch of vectors)
expanded0 = tf.expand_dims(vector, axis=0)
print(f"Expanded at axis 0 shape: {expanded0.shape}")
print(f"Expanded tensor:\n{expanded0}")

# Add dimension at index 1 (convert to a batch of column vectors)
expanded1 = tf.expand_dims(vector, axis=1)
print(f"Expanded at axis 1 shape: {expanded1.shape}")
print(f"Expanded tensor:\n{expanded1}")
```

Output:
```
Vector shape: (4,)
Expanded at axis 0 shape: (1, 4)
Expanded tensor:
[[1 2 3 4]]
Expanded at axis 1 shape: (4, 1)
Expanded tensor:
[[1]
 [2]
 [3]
 [4]]
```

#### Removing Dimensions with `tf.squeeze`

This removes dimensions of size 1:

```python
# Create a tensor with shape (1, 3, 1, 2)
tensor = tf.constant([[[[1, 2]], [[3, 4]], [[5, 6]]]])
print(f"Original shape: {tensor.shape}")

# Remove all dimensions of size 1
squeezed = tf.squeeze(tensor)
print(f"After squeezing all size-1 dimensions: {squeezed.shape}")
print(f"Squeezed tensor:\n{squeezed}")

# Remove only dimension at index 0
squeezed_0 = tf.squeeze(tensor, axis=0)
print(f"After squeezing axis 0: {squeezed_0.shape}")
```

Output:
```
Original shape: (1, 3, 1, 2)
After squeezing all size-1 dimensions: (3, 2)
Squeezed tensor:
[[1 2]
 [3 4]
 [5 6]]
After squeezing axis 0: (3, 1, 2)
```

### 3. Transposing Tensors with `tf.transpose`

Transposing swaps the dimensions of a tensor:

```python
matrix = tf.constant([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])
print(f"Original matrix:\n{matrix}")
print(f"Shape: {matrix.shape}")

# Transpose the matrix
transposed = tf.transpose(matrix)
print(f"Transposed matrix:\n{transposed}")
print(f"New shape: {transposed.shape}")
```

Output:
```
Original matrix:
[[1 2 3]
 [4 5 6]]
Shape: (2, 3)
Transposed matrix:
[[1 4]
 [2 5]
 [3 6]]
New shape: (3, 2)
```

For higher-dimensional tensors, you can specify the permutation:

```python
tensor3d = tf.constant([[[1, 2], [3, 4]], [[5, 6], [7, 8]]])
print(f"Original 3D tensor shape: {tensor3d.shape}")

# Permute the dimensions (0, 1, 2) -> (1, 0, 2)
permuted = tf.transpose(tensor3d, perm=[1, 0, 2])
print(f"Permuted tensor shape: {permuted.shape}")
print(f"Permuted tensor:\n{permuted}")
```

Output:
```
Original 3D tensor shape: (2, 2, 2)
Permuted tensor shape: (2, 2, 2)
Permuted tensor:
[[[1 2]
  [5 6]]

 [[3 4]
  [7 8]]]
```

## Real-World Applications

### Example 1: Preparing Image Data for CNN

When working with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), you often need to reshape your image data:

```python
# Simulating a batch of 4 grayscale images of size 28x28
images = tf.random.normal([4, 28, 28])
print(f"Original images shape: {images.shape}")

# Add channel dimension for CNN input (NHWC format)
images_with_channel = tf.expand_dims(images, axis=-1)
print(f"Images shape for CNN: {images_with_channel.shape}")

# If we need to convert to NCHW format (used by some frameworks)
images_nchw = tf.transpose(images_with_channel, perm=[0, 3, 1, 2])
print(f"Images in NCHW format: {images_nchw.shape}")
```

Output:
```
Original images shape: (4, 28, 28)
Images shape for CNN: (4, 28, 28, 1)
Images in NCHW format: (4, 1, 28, 28)
```

### Example 2: Preparing Data for RNN Processing

For Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), you often need to reshape your data to represent sequences:

```python
# Simulating time series data: 10 samples with 12 features each
data = tf.random.normal([10, 12])
print(f"Original data shape: {data.shape}")

# Reshape into a sequence of 3 time steps with 4 features each
sequence_data = tf.reshape(data, [10, 3, 4])
print(f"Data as sequences: {sequence_data.shape}")

# Creating a batch of these sequences
batch_size = 5
sequences_batched = tf.reshape(sequence_data[:batch_size], [batch_size, 3, 4])
print(f"Batched sequences: {sequences_batched.shape}")
```

Output:
```
Original data shape: (10, 12)
Data as sequences: (10, 3, 4)
Batched sequences: (5, 3, 4)
```

### Example 3: Flattening Tensors for Dense Layers

When transitioning from convolutional layers to dense layers, you need to flatten the tensor:

```python
# Simulating output from a convolutional layer
conv_output = tf.random.normal([32, 7, 7, 64])  # batch_size=32, height=7, width=7, channels=64
print(f"Convolutional layer output: {conv_output.shape}")

# Flatten the tensor for a dense layer
flattened = tf.reshape(conv_output, [32, -1])
print(f"Flattened for dense layer: {flattened.shape}")
```

Output:
```
Convolutional layer output: (32, 7, 7, 64)
Flattened for dense layer: (32, 3136)
```

## Advanced Shape Operations

### Using `tf.tile` to Repeat Tensors

You can use `tf.tile` to create repetitions of a tensor along specified dimensions:

```python
original = tf.constant([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
print(f"Original:\n{original}")

# Repeat 2 times along first axis and 3 times along second axis
tiled = tf.tile(original, [2, 3])
print(f"Tiled:\n{tiled}")
print(f"Tiled shape: {tiled.shape}")
```

Output:
```
Original:
[[1 2]
 [3 4]]
Tiled:
[[1 2 1 2 1 2]
 [3 4 3 4 3 4]
 [1 2 1 2 1 2]
 [3 4 3 4 3 4]]
Tiled shape: (4, 6)
```

### Gathering and Slicing for Shape Manipulation

You can also use gathering and slicing to manipulate shapes:

```python
tensor = tf.constant([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])
print(f"Original tensor:\n{tensor}")

# Extract the second row
row = tensor[1]
print(f"Second row: {row}")

# Extract the second column
col = tensor[:, 1]
print(f"Second column: {col}")

# Extract a submatrix
submatrix = tensor[0:2, 1:3]
print(f"Submatrix:\n{submatrix}")
```

Output:
```
Original tensor:
[[1 2 3]
 [4 5 6]
 [7 8 9]]
Second row: [4 5 6]
Second column: [2 5 8]
Submatrix:
[[2 3]
 [5 6]]
```

## Common Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: Incompatible Shapes for Broadcasting

TensorFlow operations often use broadcasting, which requires compatible shapes:

```python
# Two tensors with incompatible shapes for broadcasting
a = tf.constant([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
b = tf.constant([1, 2, 3])

# This would cause an error: a + b

# Solution: Reshape b to be compatible
b_reshaped = tf.reshape(b, [1, 3])
# Still incompatible with a (which is 2x2)

# Let's create a compatible tensor instead
c = tf.constant([1, 2])
# Now we can broadcast
result = a + c
print(f"Result of broadcasting:\n{result}")
```

Output:
```
Result of broadcasting:
[[2 4]
 [4 6]]
```

### Challenge 2: Keeping Track of Dimensions in Complex Models

For complex models, it can be useful to print shapes:

```python
# A simple model workflow
input_data = tf.random.normal([32, 10])
print(f"Input shape: {input_data.shape}")

# First dense layer (simulated)
weights1 = tf.random.normal([10, 20])
layer1 = tf.matmul(input_data, weights1)
print(f"After first layer: {layer1.shape}")

# Reshape to 3D for some special processing
reshaped = tf.reshape(layer1, [32, 4, 5])
print(f"After reshape: {reshaped.shape}")

# Back to 2D for another dense layer
flattened = tf.reshape(reshaped, [32, -1])
print(f"After flattening: {flattened.shape}")
```

Output:
```
Input shape: (32, 10)
After first layer: (32, 20)
After reshape: (32, 4, 5)
After flattening: (32, 20)
```
