# TensorFlow Broadcasting

Broadcasting is one of the most powerful and convenient features in TensorFlow that allows operations between tensors of different shapes. Without broadcasting, you would need to explicitly reshape your tensors to have compatible dimensions before performing operations. Understanding broadcasting will help you write more concise and efficient code.

## What is Broadcasting?

Broadcasting is a set of rules that TensorFlow (and NumPy) follow to perform operations on tensors of different shapes. It automatically expands the smaller tensor to match the shape of the larger one without creating copies of data, making operations between tensors of different dimensions possible.

Think of it as a way for the smaller tensor to "stretch" to match the larger tensor's dimensions before the operation is performed.

## Broadcasting Rules

The rules for broadcasting are straightforward:

1. If the tensors have different ranks (number of dimensions), prepend the shape of the lower-rank tensor with 1s until both have the same rank.
2. The two tensors are compatible if, for each dimension, their sizes match or one of them is 1.
3. If these conditions are met, the output tensor has the maximum size in each dimension.

## Basic Broadcasting Examples

Let's see how broadcasting works with some examples:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Creating a scalar (0-D tensor) and a 1D tensor
scalar = tf.constant(5)
vector = tf.constant([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

# Broadcasting the scalar to the vector's shape during addition
result = scalar + vector
print(f"Scalar: {scalar.numpy()}")
print(f"Vector: {vector.numpy()}")
print(f"Result: {result.numpy()}")
```

Output:
```
Scalar: 5
Vector: [1 2 3 4 5]
Result: [6 7 8 9 10]
```

In this example, the scalar `5` is broadcast to match the shape of the vector `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, resulting in an operation equivalent to `[5, 5, 5, 5, 5] + [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.

Let's look at a more complex example with 2D tensors:

```python
# Creating a row vector (1x3 matrix) and a column vector (3x1 matrix)
row_vector = tf.constant([[1, 2, 3]])  # Shape: (1, 3)
column_vector = tf.constant([[10], [20], [30]])  # Shape: (3, 1)

# Broadcasting during addition
result = row_vector + column_vector
print(f"Row vector shape: {row_vector.shape}")
print(f"Column vector shape: {column_vector.shape}")
print(f"Result shape: {result.shape}")
print(f"Result:\n{result.numpy()}")
```

Output:
```
Row vector shape: (1, 3)
Column vector shape: (3, 1)
Result shape: (3, 3)
Result:
[[11 12 13]
 [21 22 23]
 [31 32 33]]
```

In this case, both tensors are broadcast to shape `(3, 3)` before addition. The row vector `[1, 2, 3]` is duplicated along the rows, and the column vector `[10, 20, 30]` is duplicated along the columns.

## Common Broadcasting Use Cases

### Scaling a Tensor

One common use case for broadcasting is scaling all values in a tensor:

```python
# Create a 2D tensor (matrix)
matrix = tf.constant([[1, 2, 3], 
                     [4, 5, 6]], dtype=tf.float32)

# Scale all values by 2.5
scaling_factor = tf.constant(2.5)
scaled_matrix = matrix * scaling_factor

print(f"Original matrix:\n{matrix.numpy()}")
print(f"Scaled matrix:\n{scaled_matrix.numpy()}")
```

Output:
```
Original matrix:
[[1. 2. 3.]
 [4. 5. 6.]]
Scaled matrix:
[[ 2.5  5.   7.5]
 [10.  12.5 15. ]]
```

### Adding Bias to Layers

In neural networks, broadcasting is often used when adding a bias vector to the result of a matrix multiplication:

```python
# Mock output from a dense layer before bias (batch_size=2, features=3)
layer_output = tf.constant([[1.0, 2.0, 3.0],
                           [4.0, 5.0, 6.0]])

# Bias vector for the layer
bias = tf.constant([0.1, -0.2, 0.3])

# Add bias to each sample in the batch
biased_output = layer_output + bias

print(f"Layer output:\n{layer_output.numpy()}")
print(f"Bias: {bias.numpy()}")
print(f"Output after adding bias:\n{biased_output.numpy()}")
```

Output:
```
Layer output:
[[1. 2. 3.]
 [4. 5. 6.]]
Bias: [ 0.1 -0.2  0.3]
Output after adding bias:
[[1.1 1.8 3.3]
 [4.1 4.8 6.3]]
```

### Normalizing Images

Broadcasting is very useful when normalizing images in computer vision tasks:

```python
# Create a mock RGB image (height=2, width=3, channels=3)
image = tf.constant([
    [[100, 50, 150], [200, 30, 180], [50, 120, 90]],
    [[60, 70, 80], [110, 130, 140], [90, 100, 20]]
], dtype=tf.float32)

# Mean and standard deviation for each channel
mean = tf.constant([100.0, 80.0, 110.0])  # Shape: (3,)
std = tf.constant([50.0, 40.0, 60.0])     # Shape: (3,)

# Normalize the image: (image - mean) / std
normalized_image = (image - mean) / std

print(f"Original image shape: {image.shape}")
print(f"Mean shape: {mean.shape}")
print(f"Normalized image (first row):\n{normalized_image[0].numpy()}")
```

Output:
```
Original image shape: (2, 3, 3)
Mean shape: (3,)
Normalized image (first row):
[[ 0.    -0.75   0.667]
 [ 2.    -1.25   1.167]
 [-1.     1.    -0.333]]
```

## When Broadcasting Doesn't Work

Broadcasting has limitations. If the shapes are incompatible, you'll get an error:

```python
try:
    # Create tensors with incompatible shapes for broadcasting
    a = tf.constant([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])  # Shape: (2, 3)
    b = tf.constant([[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]])  # Shape: (3, 2)
    
    # Try to add them (will fail)
    result = a + b
except tf.errors.InvalidArgumentError as e:
    print("Broadcasting error:", str(e))
```

In this case, the shapes (2, 3) and (3, 2) are incompatible for broadcasting because neither dimension matches or has a size of 1.

## Explicit Reshaping for Broadcasting

If you need more control over broadcasting or want to make your code more explicit, you can manually reshape tensors:

```python
# Create a vector
vector = tf.constant([1, 2, 3, 4])  # Shape: (4,)

# Reshape it into a row vector for explicit broadcasting
row_vector = tf.reshape(vector, [1, 4])  # Shape: (1, 4)

# Create a column vector from the same data
column_vector = tf.reshape(vector, [4, 1])  # Shape: (4, 1)

# Perform broadcasting
result = row_vector + column_vector  # Shape: (4, 4)

print(f"Row vector shape: {row_vector.shape}")
print(f"Column vector shape: {column_vector.shape}")
print(f"Result shape: {result.shape}")
print(f"Result:\n{result.numpy()}")
```

Output:
```
Row vector shape: (1, 4)
Column vector shape: (4, 1)
Result shape: (4, 4)
Result:
[[2 3 4 5]
 [3 4 5 6]
 [4 5 6 7]
 [5 6 7 8]]
```

## Performance Benefits of Broadcasting

Broadcasting not only makes your code more concise but can also improve performance. Since TensorFlow doesn't actually create copies of the data during broadcasting, it can significantly reduce memory usage and computation time.

```python
import time

# Create a large matrix
large_matrix = tf.random.normal([1000, 1000])

# Method 1: Using broadcasting
start_time = time.time()
scaled_matrix_broadcast = large_matrix * 2.0
broadcast_time = time.time() - start_time

# Method 2: Creating a matrix of same shape first
start_time = time.time()
scaling_matrix = tf.ones_like(large_matrix) * 2.0
scaled_matrix_manual = large_matrix * scaling_matrix
manual_time = time.time() - start_time

print(f"Broadcasting time: {broadcast_time:.6f} seconds")
print(f"Manual scaling time: {manual_time:.6f} seconds")
print(f"Broadcasting is {manual_time/broadcast_time:.2f}x faster")
```

The output will show that broadcasting is significantly faster because it doesn't create unnecessary tensors.

## Broadcasting vs. Tiling

It's important to distinguish between broadcasting and another operation called tiling. While broadcasting is a virtual expansion of a tensor during operations, tiling actually creates a new tensor with repeated values:

```python
# Create a small vector
small_vector = tf.constant([1, 2, 3])

# Broadcast the vector during an operation
broadcast_result = small_vector + tf.zeros([3, 3])

# Tile the vector to create an actual 3x3 tensor
tiled_vector = tf.tile(tf.reshape(small_vector, [1, 3]), [3, 1])

print(f"Result using broadcasting:\n{broadcast_result.numpy()}")
print(f"Result using tiling:\n{tiled_vector.numpy()}")
print(f"Memory usage - broadcast: {broadcast_result.numpy().nbytes} bytes")
print(f"Memory usage - tiled: {tiled_vector.numpy().nbytes} bytes")
```

Broadcasting is generally preferred when possible as it's more memory-efficient.

## Summary

Broadcasting is a powerful feature in TensorFlow that allows you to perform operations on tensors of different shapes. It follows simple rules to implicitly expand smaller tensors to match the shape of larger ones, making your code more concise and often more efficient.

Key takeaways:
- Broadcasting follows specific rules based on tensor shapes
- It allows operations between tensors of different dimensions
- It's memory-efficient as it doesn't create copies of the data
