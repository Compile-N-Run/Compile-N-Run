# TensorFlow Q-Learning

## Introduction

Q-Learning is one of the most fundamental reinforcement learning algorithms that enables an agent to learn optimal behavior through trial and error. When combined with TensorFlow's neural networks, we can scale this approach to solve complex problems - a technique known as Deep Q-Learning. In this tutorial, we'll explore how to implement Q-Learning using TensorFlow, starting with basic concepts and gradually building up to a complete implementation.

## What is Q-Learning?

Q-Learning is a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm that learns the value of actions in states through experience. The "Q" stands for "quality" - representing how useful a given action is in gaining future rewards.

The core concept revolves around a Q-table (or Q-function) that maps state-action pairs to expected rewards. For complex environments with large state spaces, we can approximate this Q-function using neural networks - this is known as Deep Q-Learning.

## Basic Q-Learning Concepts

Before diving into the TensorFlow implementation, let's understand the key components:

1. **State (s)**: The current situation of the agent
2. **Action (a)**: Possible moves the agent can make
3. **Reward (r)**: Feedback from the environment
4. **Q-value**: Expected future reward for taking action a in state s
5. **Bellman Equation**: The formula for updating Q-values

The Bellman equation for Q-Learning is:

$$Q(s,a) = Q(s,a) + \alpha \times [r + \gamma \times \max_{a'} Q(s',a') - Q(s,a)]$$

Where:
- α (alpha) is the learning rate
- γ (gamma) is the discount factor
- s' is the next state
- a' is the next action

## Setting Up the Environment

Let's start by setting up our environment. We'll use OpenAI Gym's CartPole environment as it's simple yet illustrative.

```python
import gym
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense
from tensorflow.keras.optimizers import Adam
import random
from collections import deque
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Create CartPole environment
env = gym.make('CartPole-v1')
state_size = env.observation_space.shape[0]  # 4 (cart position, velocity, pole angle, pole angular velocity)
action_size = env.action_space.n  # 2 (left or right)

print(f"State size: {state_size}")
print(f"Action size: {action_size}")
```

**Output:**
```
State size: 4
Action size: 2
```

## Building the Deep Q-Network (DQN) Agent

Now, let's build our Deep Q-Network agent. The agent will have:
1. A neural network to approximate Q-values
2. Experience replay memory to store and reuse past experiences
3. Methods for selecting actions and learning from experiences

```python
class DQNAgent:
    def __init__(self, state_size, action_size):
        self.state_size = state_size
        self.action_size = action_size
        self.memory = deque(maxlen=2000)  # Experience replay buffer
        self.gamma = 0.95  # Discount factor
        self.epsilon = 1.0  # Exploration rate
        self.epsilon_min = 0.01
        self.epsilon_decay = 0.995
        self.learning_rate = 0.001
        self.model = self._build_model()
        
    def _build_model(self):
        # Neural network for Deep Q-learning Model
        model = Sequential()
        model.add(Dense(24, input_dim=self.state_size, activation='relu'))
        model.add(Dense(24, activation='relu'))
        model.add(Dense(self.action_size, activation='linear'))
        model.compile(loss='mse', optimizer=Adam(learning_rate=self.learning_rate))
        return model
    
    def remember(self, state, action, reward, next_state, done):
        # Store experience in memory
        self.memory.append((state, action, reward, next_state, done))
    
    def act(self, state):
        # Epsilon-greedy action selection
        if np.random.rand() <= self.epsilon:
            return random.randrange(self.action_size)  # Explore
        
        act_values = self.model.predict(state, verbose=0)
        return np.argmax(act_values[0])  # Exploit: choose best action
    
    def replay(self, batch_size):
        # Train on randomly sampled experiences
        if len(self.memory) < batch_size:
            return
        
        minibatch = random.sample(self.memory, batch_size)
        for state, action, reward, next_state, done in minibatch:
            target = reward
            if not done:
                target = reward + self.gamma * np.amax(self.model.predict(next_state, verbose=0)[0])
            
            target_f = self.model.predict(state, verbose=0)
            target_f[0][action] = target
            
            self.model.fit(state, target_f, epochs=1, verbose=0)
        
        if self.epsilon > self.epsilon_min:
            self.epsilon *= self.epsilon_decay
```

## Training the Agent

Now that we have our agent, let's train it on the CartPole environment:

```python
# Training parameters
episodes = 100
batch_size = 32

# Create DQN agent
agent = DQNAgent(state_size, action_size)

# Track scores
scores = []

for e in range(episodes):
    # Reset state at the beginning of each episode
    state = env.reset()
    state = np.reshape(state, [1, state_size])
    
    # Initialize variables for this episode
    done = False
    time = 0
    
    while not done:
        # env.render()  # Render the environment (uncomment to visualize)
        
        # Agent selects an action
        action = agent.act(state)
        
        # Take the action and observe next state and reward
        next_state, reward, done, _ = env.step(action)
        reward = reward if not done else -10  # Penalty when game ends
        next_state = np.reshape(next_state, [1, state_size])
        
        # Remember the experience
        agent.remember(state, action, reward, next_state, done)
        
        # Update state
        state = next_state
        
        # Update time (score)
        time += 1
        
        if done:
            print(f"Episode: {e+1}/{episodes}, score: {time}, epsilon: {agent.epsilon:.2}")
            scores.append(time)
            break
    
    # Train the agent with experiences in replay memory
    agent.replay(batch_size)
```

Let's also add a function to visualize the training progress:

```python
def plot_scores(scores):
    plt.figure(figsize=(10,6))
    plt.plot(scores)
    plt.xlabel('Episode')
    plt.ylabel('Score')
    plt.title('Training Progress')
    plt.grid(True)
    plt.savefig('dqn_training_progress.png')
    plt.show()

# After training, plot the scores
plot_scores(scores)
```

## Evaluating the Trained Agent

After training, we should evaluate our agent to see how well it performs:

```python
def evaluate_agent(agent, env, episodes=10):
    scores = []
    for e in range(episodes):
        state = env.reset()
        state = np.reshape(state, [1, state_size])
        done = False
        score = 0
        
        while not done:
            env.render()  # Visualize the environment
            action = agent.act(state)
            next_state, reward, done, _ = env.step(action)
            next_state = np.reshape(next_state, [1, state_size])
            state = next_state
            score += 1
            if done:
                break
        
        scores.append(score)
        print(f"Evaluation episode {e+1}: Score = {score}")
    
    print(f"Average score over {episodes} episodes: {np.mean(scores)}")
    return scores

# Evaluate the trained agent
eval_scores = evaluate_agent(agent, env)
```

## Practical Applications of Q-Learning with TensorFlow

Deep Q-Learning is widely used in various applications:

### 1. Game AI
Deep Q-Networks can be trained to play Atari games by learning directly from pixel inputs. The same approach we explored with CartPole can be expanded to more complex games.

### 2. Robotics
Q-Learning helps robots learn optimal movement policies. For example, teaching a robotic arm to pick up objects or navigate through obstacles.

```python
# Example: Defining a custom robotics environment 
# (conceptual, not runnable without additional setup)
class RobotArmEnv:
    def __init__(self):
        self.arm_position = [0, 0]
        self.target = [5, 5]
        
    def reset(self):
        self.arm_position = [0, 0]
        return np.array(self.arm_position)
        
    def step(self, action):
        # Actions: 0=up, 1=right, 2=down, 3=left
        if action == 0:
            self.arm_position[1] += 1
        elif action == 1:
            self.arm_position[0] += 1
        elif action == 2:
            self.arm_position[1] -= 1
        elif action == 3:
            self.arm_position[0] -= 1
            
        # Calculate reward (negative distance)
        distance = np.sqrt((self.arm_position[0] - self.target[0])**2 + 
                          (self.arm_position[1] - self.target[1])**2)
        reward = -distance
        
        # Check if we reached target
        done = distance < 0.5
        
        return np.array(self.arm_position), reward, done, {}
```

### 3. Resource Management
Q-learning can optimize resource allocation in cloud computing, power grids, or traffic management.

### 4. Finance
Reinforcement learning agents can learn trading strategies by optimizing portfolio allocations based on market signals.

## Advanced Techniques in Deep Q-Learning

As you progress, consider these advanced techniques:

### 1. Double DQN
Uses two networks to reduce overestimation of Q-values:

```python
def update_target_model(self):
    # Copy weights from model to target_model
    self.target_model.set_weights(self.model.get_weights())

# In replay function:
target = reward
if not done:
    target = reward + self.gamma * np.amax(self.target_model.predict(next_state)[0])
```

### 2. Prioritized Experience Replay
Weight experiences by their importance:

```python
# Instead of random sampling
priority_weights = calculate_td_errors()  # Higher error, higher priority
minibatch = sample_based_on_priority(self.memory, batch_size, priority_weights)
```

### 3. Dueling Networks
Separate calculation of state values and action advantages:

```python
def dueling_model(self):
    inputs = tf.keras.layers.Input(shape=(self.state_size,))
    x = Dense(24, activation='relu')(inputs)
    
    # Value stream
    value_stream = Dense(16, activation='relu')(x)
    value = Dense(1)(value_stream)
    
    # Advantage stream
    advantage_stream = Dense(16, activation='relu')(x)
    advantage = Dense(self.action_size)(advantage_stream)
    
    # Combine value and advantage
    q_values = value + (advantage - tf.reduce_mean(advantage, axis=1, keepdims=True))
    
    model = tf.keras.Model(inputs=inputs, outputs=q_values)
    model.compile(loss='mse', optimizer=Adam(learning_rate=self.learning_rate))
    return model
```
