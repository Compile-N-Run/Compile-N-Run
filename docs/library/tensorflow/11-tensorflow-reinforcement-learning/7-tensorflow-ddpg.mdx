# TensorFlow DDPG

## Introduction

Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) is an advanced reinforcement learning algorithm designed to handle continuous action spaces. Unlike traditional reinforcement learning methods that work well for discrete action spaces (like Q-learning), DDPG can effectively learn policies for environments where actions are continuous values (e.g., controlling a robot's joint movements or adjusting motor speeds).

In this tutorial, we'll explore how to implement DDPG using TensorFlow. By the end, you'll understand:

- Why we need specialized algorithms for continuous action spaces
- How DDPG combines actor-critic architecture with deep learning
- How to implement DDPG from scratch using TensorFlow
- How to apply DDPG to real-world problems

## Prerequisites

Before diving in, you should have:
- Basic understanding of reinforcement learning concepts
- Familiarity with TensorFlow
- Understanding of neural networks
- Python programming skills

Let's install the necessary packages:

```python
!pip install tensorflow gym numpy matplotlib
```

## The Problem with Continuous Action Spaces

In reinforcement learning, an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment. Traditional algorithms like Q-learning work by creating a table or approximation of values for each state-action pair. This works well when actions are discrete (like "move left" or "move right"), but breaks down with continuous actions.

For example, consider controlling a robot arm:
- Discrete actions: Move joint 1 left, move joint 1 right
- Continuous actions: Move joint 1 by 0.234 radians

Continuous action spaces have an infinite number of possible actions, making it impossible to evaluate each one individually.

## DDPG: A Solution for Continuous Control

DDPG solves this problem through several key innovations:

1. **Actor-Critic Architecture**: Combines policy-based and value-based learning
2. **Deterministic Policy**: Outputs specific actions rather than probabilities
3. **Experience Replay**: Stores and reuses past experiences
4. **Target Networks**: Stabilizes training through slowly-updated network copies

Let's break down each component before implementing them.

## Understanding the DDPG Architecture

DDPG uses two main networks:

1. **Actor Network**: Takes a state and outputs the best action (policy)
2. **Critic Network**: Takes a state and action and outputs a Q-value (how good the action is)

Each network has two versions:
- The regular networks used for training
- Target networks that are slowly updated, providing stability

Here's the high-level algorithm:

1. Initialize actor, critic, target actor, and target critic networks
2. For each episode:
   - Reset the environment
   - For each step:
     - Select an action with exploration noise
     - Execute the action and observe reward and next state
     - Store transition in replay buffer
     - Sample a random batch from buffer
     - Update critic by minimizing loss
     - Update actor using the deterministic policy gradient
     - Soft update target networks

## Implementing DDPG with TensorFlow

Let's implement DDPG step by step:

### 1. Import Libraries and Set Up Environment

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
import gym
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from collections import deque
import random

# Create the Pendulum environment
env = gym.make('Pendulum-v1')

state_dim = env.observation_space.shape[0]
action_dim = env.action_space.shape[0]
action_high = env.action_space.high[0]
action_low = env.action_space.low[0]

print(f"State dimension: {state_dim}")
print(f"Action dimension: {action_dim}")
print(f"Action range: [{action_low}, {action_high}]")
```

**Output:**
```
State dimension: 3
Action dimension: 1
Action range: [-2.0, 2.0]
```

### 2. Create the Actor and Critic Networks

```python
class Actor(tf.keras.Model):
    def __init__(self, action_dim, action_high):
        super(Actor, self).__init__()
        self.dense1 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(400, activation='relu')
        self.dense2 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(300, activation='relu')
        self.output_layer = tf.keras.layers.Dense(action_dim, activation='tanh')
        self.action_high = action_high
        
    def call(self, states):
        x = self.dense1(states)
        x = self.dense2(x)
        # Scale output to action space range
        return self.output_layer(x) * self.action_high
        
class Critic(tf.keras.Model):
    def __init__(self):
        super(Critic, self).__init__()
        self.state_dense = tf.keras.layers.Dense(400, activation='relu')
        self.state_action_dense = tf.keras.layers.Dense(300, activation='relu')
        self.output_layer = tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
        
    def call(self, states, actions):
        x = self.state_dense(states)
        x = tf.concat([x, actions], axis=1)
        x = self.state_action_dense(x)
        return self.output_layer(x)
```

### 3. Implement Replay Buffer for Experience Replay

```python
class ReplayBuffer:
    def __init__(self, capacity=100000):
        self.buffer = deque(maxlen=capacity)
        
    def add(self, state, action, reward, next_state, done):
        self.buffer.append((state, action, reward, next_state, done))
        
    def sample(self, batch_size):
        samples = random.sample(self.buffer, batch_size)
        states, actions, rewards, next_states, dones = map(np.array, zip(*samples))
        return states, actions, rewards, next_states, dones
        
    def size(self):
        return len(self.buffer)
```

### 4. Create the DDPG Agent

```python
class DDPGAgent:
    def __init__(self, state_dim, action_dim, action_high):
        # Initialize actors and critics
        self.actor = Actor(action_dim, action_high)
        self.critic = Critic()
        self.target_actor = Actor(action_dim, action_high)
        self.target_critic = Critic()
        
        # Copy weights
        self.target_actor.set_weights(self.actor.get_weights())
        self.target_critic.set_weights(self.critic.get_weights())
        
        # Optimizers
        self.actor_optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.001)
        self.critic_optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.002)
        
        # Hyperparameters
        self.gamma = 0.99  # Discount factor
        self.tau = 0.005   # Target network update rate
        self.buffer = ReplayBuffer()
        
        # Noise process for exploration
        self.noise_stddev = 0.2
        
    def get_action(self, state, add_noise=True):
        state = tf.convert_to_tensor([state], dtype=tf.float32)
        action = self.actor(state).numpy()[0]
        
        if add_noise:
            noise = np.random.normal(0, self.noise_stddev, size=action.shape)
            action += noise
            # Clip action to be within valid range
            action = np.clip(action, -action_high, action_high)
            
        return action
    
    def update(self, batch_size=64):
        if self.buffer.size() < batch_size:
            return
            
        # Sample from replay buffer
        states, actions, rewards, next_states, dones = self.buffer.sample(batch_size)
        
        # Convert to tensors
        states = tf.convert_to_tensor(states, dtype=tf.float32)
        actions = tf.convert_to_tensor(actions, dtype=tf.float32)
        rewards = tf.convert_to_tensor(rewards, dtype=tf.float32)
        next_states = tf.convert_to_tensor(next_states, dtype=tf.float32)
        dones = tf.convert_to_tensor(dones, dtype=tf.float32)
        
        # Update critic
        with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
            # Get target actions from target actor
            target_actions = self.target_actor(next_states)
            
            # Get target Q values
            target_q = self.target_critic(next_states, target_actions)
            
            # Compute target value with Bellman equation
            target = rewards + (1 - dones) * self.gamma * target_q
            
            # Get current Q estimates
            current_q = self.critic(states, actions)
            
            # Compute critic loss
            critic_loss = tf.reduce_mean(tf.square(target - current_q))
        
        # Get critic gradients
        critic_gradients = tape.gradient(critic_loss, self.critic.trainable_variables)
        
        # Apply gradients
        self.critic_optimizer.apply_gradients(
            zip(critic_gradients, self.critic.trainable_variables)
        )
        
        # Update actor
        with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
            # Get actor actions
            actor_actions = self.actor(states)
            
            # Compute actor loss (negative of critic value)
            actor_loss = -tf.reduce_mean(self.critic(states, actor_actions))
        
        # Get actor gradients
        actor_gradients = tape.gradient(actor_loss, self.actor.trainable_variables)
        
        # Apply gradients
        self.actor_optimizer.apply_gradients(
            zip(actor_gradients, self.actor.trainable_variables)
        )
        
        # Update target networks
        self.update_target_networks()
        
    def update_target_networks(self):
        # Soft update target networks
        for target_var, var in zip(self.target_actor.variables, self.actor.variables):
            target_var.assign(self.tau * var + (1 - self.tau) * target_var)
            
        for target_var, var in zip(self.target_critic.variables, self.critic.variables):
            target_var.assign(self.tau * var + (1 - self.tau) * target_var)
```

### 5. Training the Agent

Now let's train our DDPG agent to solve the Pendulum-v1 environment:

```python
# Create the agent
agent = DDPGAgent(state_dim, action_dim, action_high)

# Training parameters
num_episodes = 200
max_steps = 200
batch_size = 64
rewards_history = []

# Training loop
for episode in range(num_episodes):
    state, _ = env.reset()
    episode_reward = 0
    
    for step in range(max_steps):
        # Get action
        action = agent.get_action(state)
        
        # Take action
        next_state, reward, terminated, truncated, _ = env.step(action)
        done = terminated or truncated
        
        # Store in replay buffer
        agent.buffer.add(state, action, reward, next_state, done)
        
        # Update networks
        agent.update(batch_size)
        
        # Update state and reward
        state = next_state
        episode_reward += reward
        
        if done:
            break
    
    rewards_history.append(episode_reward)
    
    # Print progress
    if episode % 10 == 0:
        avg_reward = np.mean(rewards_history[-10:])
        print(f"Episode {episode}, Avg Reward: {avg_reward:.2f}")

# Visualize training progress
plt.plot(rewards_history)
plt.title('DDPG Training on Pendulum-v1')
plt.xlabel('Episode')
plt.ylabel('Total Reward')
plt.savefig('ddpg_training.png')
plt.show()
```

**Sample Output:**
```
Episode 0, Avg Reward: -1384.35
Episode 10, Avg Reward: -1245.67
Episode 20, Avg Reward: -1032.18
...
Episode 190, Avg Reward: -198.45
```

### 6. Testing the Trained Agent

After training, let's see how our agent performs:

```python
def test_agent(agent, env, episodes=5):
    for episode in range(episodes):
        state, _ = env.reset()
        episode_reward = 0
        
        for step in range(200):
            # Render environment (uncomment for visualization)
            # env.render()
            
            # Get action without noise
            action = agent.get_action(state, add_noise=False)
            
            # Take action
            next_state, reward, terminated, truncated, _ = env.step(action)
            done = terminated or truncated
            
            episode_reward += reward
            state = next_state
            
            if done:
                break
                
        print(f"Test Episode {episode + 1}, Total Reward: {episode_reward:.2f}")
    
    env.close()

# Test our trained agent
test_agent(agent, env)
```

**Sample Output:**
```
Test Episode 1, Total Reward: -132.45
Test Episode 2, Total Reward: -145.21
Test Episode 3, Total Reward: -128.76
Test Episode 4, Total Reward: -136.98
Test Episode 5, Total Reward: -131.54
```

## Understanding Key Components of DDPG

Let's break down the key aspects that make DDPG work:

### Actor-Critic Architecture

1. **Actor**: Determines the best action for a given state
2. **Critic**: Evaluates how good the chosen action is at a given state

This combination allows us to make decisions in continuous spaces while still evaluating how good those decisions are.

### Target Networks

DDPG uses separate target networks that get updated slowly through "soft updates":

```python
target_param = tau * param + (1 - tau) * target_param
```

This stabilizes training by providing a more consistent target to learn against, preventing the "moving target" problem.

### Experience Replay

By storing experiences and sampling them randomly:
1. We break the correlation between consecutive experiences
2. We make better use of data by learning from it multiple times
3. We ensure more stable gradients during training

### Exploration with Noise

Adding noise to our deterministic actions enables exploration of the action space:

```python
action = actor(state) + noise
```

As training progresses, we typically reduce the noise to focus more on exploitation.

## Real-World Applications of DDPG

DDPG can be applied to many real-world continuous control problems:

### Robotic Control

```python
# Example: Training a robotic arm to reach targets
import pybullet_envs
env = gym.make("KukaBulletEnv-v0")
# Then apply DDPG as we've learned
```

### Autonomous Vehicles

DDPG can handle continuous steering, acceleration, and braking decisions:

```python
# Example configuration for self-driving car simulation
agent = DDPGAgent(
    state_dim=sensors_count,
    action_dim=3,  # steering, acceleration, braking
    action_high=np.array([1.0, 1.0, 1.0])
)
```

### Resource Management

DDPG can optimize continuous decision making for resource allocation:

```python
# Example for data center cooling optimization
class DataCenterEnv:
    def __init__(self):
        self.temperature = 75.0  # Starting temperature
        self.power_usage = 100.0  # Starting power usage
        # ...
        
    def step(self, action):
        # action[0]: Fan speed (continuous from 0 to 1)
        # action[1]: Cooling power (continuous from 0 to 1)
        # ...
```

## Summary

In this tutorial, we've covered:

1. The challenge of handling continuous action spaces in reinforcement learning
2. How DDPG combines actor-critic architecture with deep learning to solve these challenges
3. A step-by-step implementation of DDPG using TensorFlow
4. Training and testing a DDPG agent on the Pendulum-v1 environment
5. Key components that make DDPG work: target networks, experience replay, and exploration noise
6. Real-world applications of DDPG

DDPG is a powerful algorithm for continuous control problems, but it can be sensitive to hyperparameters and sometimes requires careful tuning. As you implement your own DDPG solutions, pay attention to:

- Learning rates
- Network architectures
- Noise parameters
- Buffer size and batch size

           q = agent.critic(tf.convert_to_tensor([states[0]], dtype=tf.float32), 
                          tf.convert_to_tensor([[action]], dtype=tf.float32))
           q_values.append(q.numpy()[0][0])
