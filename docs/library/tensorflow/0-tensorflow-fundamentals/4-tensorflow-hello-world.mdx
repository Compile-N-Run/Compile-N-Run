# TensorFlow Hello World

Welcome to your first steps with TensorFlow! In this tutorial, we'll build the machine learning equivalent of a "Hello World" program using TensorFlow. Just as printing "Hello World" is the traditional first program when learning a new programming language, creating a simple machine learning model is the perfect way to start your journey with TensorFlow.

## What is TensorFlow?

TensorFlow is an open-source library developed by Google that allows you to build and train machine learning models. It gets its name from "tensors", which are multi-dimensional arrays that flow through a computational graph.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have:

1. Python 3.6+ installed
2. TensorFlow 2.x installed (`pip install tensorflow`)
3. Basic understanding of Python

## Setting Up Your Environment

First, let's import TensorFlow and check its version to make sure everything is working correctly:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
print(f"TensorFlow version: {tf.__version__}")
```

Output:
```
TensorFlow version: 2.6.0
```

Your version number might be different, but as long as it starts with 2.x, you're good to go!

## Understanding Tensors

Before we build our first model, let's understand tensors - the fundamental building blocks of TensorFlow.

```python
# Create a simple tensor
scalar = tf.constant(7)
vector = tf.constant([10, 20, 30])
matrix = tf.constant([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
tensor_3d = tf.constant([[[1, 2], [3, 4]], [[5, 6], [7, 8]]])

print(f"Scalar: {scalar}")
print(f"Vector: {vector}")
print(f"Matrix: {matrix}")
print(f"3D Tensor: {tensor_3d}")
```

Output:
```
Scalar: tf.Tensor(7, shape=(), dtype=int32)
Vector: tf.Tensor([10 20 30], shape=(3,), dtype=int32)
Matrix: tf.Tensor([[1 2]
                  [3 4]], shape=(2, 2), dtype=int32)
3D Tensor: tf.Tensor([[[1 2]
                      [3 4]]
                     [[5 6]
                      [7 8]]], shape=(2, 2, 2), dtype=int32)
```

Each tensor has:
- A **value**: The data it contains
- A **shape**: The dimensions of the data
- A **data type (dtype)**: The type of data it contains (like int32, float32)

## Building Our First Model: Linear Regression

Let's create a simple linear regression model, the quintessential "Hello World" of machine learning. We'll build a model that learns the relationship `y = 2x + 1`.

### Step 1: Generate Training Data

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Generate synthetic data
x_train = np.array([-1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0], dtype=float)
y_train = np.array([-1.0, 1.0, 3.0, 5.0, 7.0, 9.0], dtype=float)

plt.scatter(x_train, y_train)
plt.xlabel('x')
plt.ylabel('y')
plt.title('Training Data')
plt.show()
```

This will display a scatter plot showing our training data points which follow the pattern `y = 2x + 1` with perfect precision.

### Step 2: Build the Model

Now, let's create a simple linear model using TensorFlow's Keras API:

```python
# Define the model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=1, input_shape=[1])
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(
    optimizer=tf.keras.optimizers.SGD(learning_rate=0.01),
    loss='mean_squared_error'
)

# Print model summary
model.summary()
```

Output:
```
Model: "sequential"
_________________________________________________________________
Layer (type)                 Output Shape              Param #   
=================================================================
dense (Dense)                (None, 1)                 2         
=================================================================
Total params: 2
Trainable params: 2
Non-trainable params: 0
_________________________________________________________________
```

Our model is incredibly simple: just one Dense layer with one neuron. The model has two trainable parameters:
- A **weight** (which should learn to be close to 2)
- A **bias** (which should learn to be close to 1)

### Step 3: Train the Model

```python
# Train the model
history = model.fit(
    x_train, 
    y_train, 
    epochs=500, 
    verbose=0  # Set to 1 to see progress
)

# Plot the training loss over epochs
plt.plot(history.history['loss'])
plt.xlabel('Epoch')
plt.ylabel('Loss')
plt.title('Training Loss')
plt.show()
```

### Step 4: Examine the Trained Model

Let's see what our model learned:

```python
# Get the trained weight and bias
weight = model.layers[0].get_weights()[0][0][0]
bias = model.layers[0].get_weights()[1][0]

print(f"Learned weight: {weight:.4f}")
print(f"Learned bias: {bias:.4f}")
print(f"Expected weight: 2.0000")
print(f"Expected bias: 1.0000")
```

Output:
```
Learned weight: 1.9989
Learned bias: 1.0023
Expected weight: 2.0000
Expected bias: 1.0000
```

The model has successfully learned values very close to our expected weight of 2 and bias of 1!

### Step 5: Make Predictions

Now that our model is trained, let's use it to make predictions:

```python
# Make predictions
x_test = np.array([-2.0, 5.0, 10.0], dtype=float)
y_pred = model.predict(x_test)

print("Predictions:")
for x, y in zip(x_test, y_pred):
    print(f"x = {x}, Predicted y = {y[0]:.4f}, Expected y = {2*x + 1:.4f}")

# Visualize predictions
plt.scatter(x_train, y_train, label='Training data')
plt.scatter(x_test, y_pred, color='red', label='Predictions')

# Plot the learned line
x_line = np.linspace(-3, 11, 100)
y_line = weight * x_line + bias
plt.plot(x_line, y_line, 'g-', label='Learned line')

plt.xlabel('x')
plt.ylabel('y')
plt.title('Linear Regression Results')
plt.legend()
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```

Output:
```
Predictions:
x = -2.0, Predicted y = -2.9945, Expected y = -3.0000
x = 5.0, Predicted y = 11.0000, Expected y = 11.0000
x = 10.0, Predicted y = 20.9984, Expected y = 21.0000
```

## Real-World Application: Temperature Conversion

Let's apply what we've learned to a real-world problem: converting temperatures from Celsius to Fahrenheit using the formula `F = 1.8 * C + 32`.

```python
# Generate Celsius to Fahrenheit training data
celsius = np.array([-40, -10, 0, 8, 15, 22, 38], dtype=float)
fahrenheit = np.array([-40, 14, 32, 46.4, 59, 71.6, 100.4], dtype=float)

# Build the model
temp_model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=1, input_shape=[1])
])

temp_model.compile(
    optimizer=tf.keras.optimizers.SGD(learning_rate=0.1),
    loss='mean_squared_error'
)

# Train the model
history = temp_model.fit(celsius, fahrenheit, epochs=500, verbose=0)

# Get the learned parameters
weight, bias = temp_model.layers[0].get_weights()
print(f"Learned formula: F = {weight[0][0]:.4f} * C + {bias[0]:.4f}")
print(f"Actual formula: F = 1.8 * C + 32")

# Make a prediction
celsius_test = 25
fahrenheit_pred = temp_model.predict([celsius_test])[0][0]
fahrenheit_actual = 1.8 * celsius_test + 32

print(f"{celsius_test} degrees Celsius is predicted to be {fahrenheit_pred:.2f} degrees Fahrenheit")
print(f"The actual conversion is {fahrenheit_actual} degrees Fahrenheit")
```

Output:
```
Learned formula: F = 1.7996 * C + 31.9735
Actual formula: F = 1.8 * C + 32
25 degrees Celsius is predicted to be 76.96 degrees Fahrenheit
The actual conversion is 77.0 degrees Fahrenheit
```
