# TensorFlow Versioning

## Introduction

Understanding TensorFlow's versioning system is a crucial skill for any machine learning developer. As TensorFlow evolves, its APIs, features, and performance characteristics change. This can affect how your code runs and whether it remains compatible with the latest TensorFlow releases.

In this guide, you'll learn about:
- How TensorFlow uses semantic versioning
- Major TensorFlow version differences
- How to check your TensorFlow version
- Managing compatibility between versions
- Best practices for version control in ML projects

## TensorFlow Semantic Versioning

TensorFlow follows a semantic versioning pattern, which consists of three numbers: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`. For example, in TensorFlow 2.8.0:

- **MAJOR (2)**: Indicates major changes that are often not backward compatible
- **MINOR (8)**: Represents new features added in a backward-compatible manner
- **PATCH (0)**: Indicates backward-compatible bug fixes

### TensorFlow 1.x vs 2.x

The shift from TensorFlow 1.x to 2.x represented the most significant change in the framework's history, with fundamental changes to the programming model:

| TensorFlow 1.x | TensorFlow 2.x |
|----------------|----------------|
| Session-based execution | Eager execution by default |
| Complex graph building | Simpler, more Pythonic API |
| `tf.contrib` package | Reorganized modules |
| Manual device placement | Automatic device placement |

## Checking Your TensorFlow Version

Let's see how to check which version of TensorFlow you have installed:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Print TensorFlow version
print(f"TensorFlow version: {tf.__version__}")

# Print additional version information
print(f"Keras version: {tf.keras.__version__}")
print(f"GPU available: {tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')}")
```

Output:
```
TensorFlow version: 2.8.0
Keras version: 2.8.0
GPU available: [PhysicalDevice(name='/physical_device:GPU:0', device_type='GPU')]
```

## Installing Specific TensorFlow Versions

You can install a specific version of TensorFlow using pip:

```bash
# Install a specific version
pip install tensorflow==2.8.0

# Install the latest stable version
pip install tensorflow

# Install the nightly build
pip install tf-nightly
```

## Version Compatibility

### API Compatibility

TensorFlow maintains backward compatibility within major versions, but API changes between major versions can break your code. Let's see an example of code that works differently between TensorFlow 1.x and 2.x:

**TensorFlow 1.x style:**

```python
# TensorFlow 1.x
import tensorflow as tf

# Create a session
sess = tf.Session()

# Define constants
a = tf.constant(5.0)
b = tf.constant(6.0)

# Define computation
c = a * b

# Run the computation
print(sess.run(c))  # Output: 30.0

# Close the session
sess.close()
```

**TensorFlow 2.x style:**

```python
# TensorFlow 2.x
import tensorflow as tf

# Define constants
a = tf.constant(5.0)
b = tf.constant(6.0)

# Computation executes eagerly
c = a * b

# Print result
print(c)  # Output: tf.Tensor(30.0, shape=(), dtype=float32)
```

### Using TensorFlow 1.x Code in TensorFlow 2.x

TensorFlow 2.x provides compatibility features to run 1.x code:

```python
# Enable TF1.x compatibility mode
import tensorflow.compat.v1 as tf
tf.disable_v2_behavior()

# Now you can use TF1.x style code
sess = tf.Session()
a = tf.constant(5.0)
b = tf.constant(6.0)
c = a * b
print(sess.run(c))  # Output: 30.0
sess.close()
```

## Saved Model Compatibility

Models saved with one version of TensorFlow might not load correctly in another version. Here's how to save and load models with version compatibility in mind:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Create a simple model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(5,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
])

# Save the model with a version tag
tf.saved_model.save(model, "./saved_model_tf2.8")

# When loading, you can specify the tags
loaded_model = tf.saved_model.load("./saved_model_tf2.8")
```

### Version Constraints in `requirements.txt`

When sharing your project, it's a good practice to specify TensorFlow version constraints:

```
# Exact version
tensorflow==2.8.0

# Minimum version
tensorflow>=2.8.0

# Range of versions
tensorflow>=2.8.0,<3.0.0
```

## Practical Example: Version-Aware Text Classification

Let's build a simple text classification model that works across TensorFlow versions:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Version check and adjustments
if tf.__version__.startswith('1.'):
    print("Using TensorFlow 1.x style")
    # TF 1.x specific imports and setup
    import tensorflow.compat.v1 as tf
    tf.disable_v2_behavior()
else:
    print("Using TensorFlow 2.x style")
    # TF 2.x is good to go!

# Create a simple text classification model that works in both versions
def create_text_classification_model(vocab_size=10000, embedding_dim=16):
    if tf.__version__.startswith('1.'):
        # TF 1.x style model building
        inputs = tf.keras.Input(shape=(None,))
        x = tf.keras.layers.Embedding(vocab_size, embedding_dim)(inputs)
        x = tf.keras.layers.GlobalAveragePooling1D()(x)
        x = tf.keras.layers.Dense(16, activation='relu')(x)
        outputs = tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')(x)
        model = tf.keras.Model(inputs=inputs, outputs=outputs)
        model.compile(optimizer='adam',
                     loss='binary_crossentropy',
                     metrics=['accuracy'])
    else:
        # TF 2.x style model building
        model = tf.keras.Sequential([
            tf.keras.layers.Embedding(vocab_size, embedding_dim),
            tf.keras.layers.GlobalAveragePooling1D(),
            tf.keras.layers.Dense(16, activation='relu'),
            tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
        ])
        model.compile(optimizer='adam',
                     loss='binary_crossentropy',
                     metrics=['accuracy'])
    return model

# Create the model
model = create_text_classification_model()
print(model.summary())
```

## Best Practices for TensorFlow Version Management

1. **Always specify the TensorFlow version** in your project documentation and requirements
2. **Test your code on multiple versions** if you expect it to be used across different environments
3. **Use version checks** in your code to handle version-specific logic
4. **Consider Docker containers** to ensure consistent environments across development and production
5. **Follow the migration guides** when upgrading to newer TensorFlow versions

## Handling Breaking Changes

When you encounter breaking changes between versions, consider these approaches:

1. **Check the migration guide**: TensorFlow provides detailed migration guides for major version changes
2. **Use compatibility modules**: Like `tensorflow.compat.v1` for backwards compatibility
3. **Refactor your code**: Sometimes it's best to embrace the new paradigm
4. **Pin your dependencies**: If you can't update right away, pin to a working version

Here's a simple example of handling a breaking change:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Check TensorFlow version and use appropriate API
if tf.__version__.startswith('1.'):
    # TF 1.x way to get variable scope
    var_scope = tf.variable_scope
else:
    # TF 2.x way to get variable scope
    var_scope = tf.compat.v1.variable_scope if hasattr(tf.compat, 'v1') else tf.variable_scope
    
# Now use var_scope in a version-agnostic way
with var_scope('my_model'):
    # Your model code here
    pass
```
