# TensorFlow Sequence Modeling

## Introduction

Sequence modeling is a fundamental concept in machine learning that deals with data that comes in sequences, where the order matters. Examples include time series data (stock prices, weather measurements), text (sentences, paragraphs), audio signals, and more. Traditional neural networks struggle with such data because they assume that inputs are independent of each other. This is where Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) shine!

In this tutorial, we'll explore how to use TensorFlow to build models that can effectively learn patterns from sequential data. We'll cover basic RNN cells, more advanced architectures like LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) and GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit), and show you how to implement them for real-world applications.

## Understanding Sequence Data

Before diving into the code, let's understand what makes sequence data special:

1. **Order matters** - The sequence of elements is significant
2. **Variable length** - Sequences can have different lengths
3. **Temporal dependencies** - Elements in the sequence may depend on previous elements

Examples of sequence data include:
- Text: Words in a sentence follow a specific order
- Time series: Stock prices, where today's price is influenced by previous days
- Audio: Sound waves represented as a sequence of amplitude values
- Video: Series of frames that make sense in a specific order

## Basic RNN Architectures in TensorFlow

Let's start with a simple RNN implementation in TensorFlow:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Create a basic RNN layer
simple_rnn = tf.keras.layers.SimpleRNN(
    units=64,               # Number of neurons in the RNN cell
    activation='tanh',      # Activation function
    return_sequences=True   # Return the full sequence of outputs
)

# Sample input data (batch_size=2, time_steps=3, features=4)
sample_input = np.random.random((2, 3, 4))
print("Input shape:", sample_input.shape)

# Process the input through the RNN
output = simple_rnn(sample_input)
print("Output shape:", output.shape)
```

**Output:**
```
Input shape: (2, 3, 4)
Output shape: (2, 3, 64)
```

In this example:
- We created a `SimpleRNN` layer with 64 neurons
- Our input has shape `(batch_size, time_steps, features)`
- With `return_sequences=True`, the output gives us values for each time step

### Understanding RNN Parameters

- **units**: Number of neurons in the RNN cell
- **activation**: Activation function (typically 'tanh' for RNNs)
- **return_sequences**: Whether to return the output for each time step or just the final step
- **return_state**: Whether to return the hidden state along with the output

## Advanced RNN Architectures

While simple RNNs are useful for understanding the basics, they suffer from the "vanishing gradient" problem, making them ineffective for learning long-term dependencies. More advanced architectures help solve this issue:

### LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)

```python
# Create an LSTM layer
lstm_layer = tf.keras.layers.LSTM(
    units=64,
    return_sequences=True
)

# Process the same input through the LSTM
lstm_output = lstm_layer(sample_input)
print("LSTM output shape:", lstm_output.shape)
```

**Output:**
```
LSTM output shape: (2, 3, 64)
```

### GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit)

```python
# Create a GRU layer
gru_layer = tf.keras.layers.GRU(
    units=64,
    return_sequences=True
)

# Process the same input through the GRU
gru_output = gru_layer(sample_input)
print("GRU output shape:", gru_output.shape)
```

**Output:**
```
GRU output shape: (2, 3, 64)
```

## Building a Sequence Model

Now, let's put it all together to build a complete sequential model for time series prediction:

```python
def build_sequence_model(input_shape, output_units=1):
    """
    Build a sequence model using LSTM layers
    
    Args:
        input_shape: Tuple of (timesteps, features)
        output_units: Number of output units
    
    Returns:
        A compiled Keras model
    """
    model = tf.keras.Sequential([
        # Add an LSTM layer with 128 units
        tf.keras.layers.LSTM(
            units=128,
            input_shape=input_shape,
            return_sequences=True
        ),
        # Add a second LSTM layer with 64 units
        tf.keras.layers.LSTM(
            units=64,
            return_sequences=False  # Only return the last output
        ),
        # Add a Dense layer for output
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(output_units)
    ])
    
    model.compile(
        optimizer=tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(0.001),
        loss='mean_squared_error'
    )
    
    return model
```

## Practical Example: Time Series Prediction

Let's implement a complete example to predict time series data using our sequence model:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler

# Generate synthetic time series data
def generate_time_series(n_samples=1000):
    # Create a time series with multiple seasonal patterns and a trend
    time = np.arange(0, n_samples)
    # Trend component
    trend = 0.001 * time
    # Seasonal components
    season1 = 0.5 * np.sin(2 * np.pi * time / 50)  # Period of 50
    season2 = 0.2 * np.sin(2 * np.pi * time / 100)  # Period of 100
    # Noise component
    noise = 0.1 * np.random.randn(n_samples)
    # Combine all components
    series = trend + season1 + season2 + noise
    return series

# Generate data
time_series = generate_time_series(1000)

# Normalize data between 0 and 1
scaler = MinMaxScaler(feature_range=(0, 1))
time_series_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(time_series.reshape(-1, 1))

# Create training sequences
def create_sequences(data, seq_length):
    xs, ys = [], []
    for i in range(len(data) - seq_length):
        x = data[i:i+seq_length]
        y = data[i+seq_length]
        xs.append(x)
        ys.append(y)
    return np.array(xs), np.array(ys)

# Use 30 time steps to predict the next value
seq_length = 30
X, y = create_sequences(time_series_scaled, seq_length)

# Split into training and testing sets
train_size = int(len(X) * 0.8)
X_train, X_test = X[:train_size], X[train_size:]
y_train, y_test = y[:train_size], y[train_size:]

# Reshape input to match the expected shape: [samples, time steps, features]
X_train = X_train.reshape((X_train.shape[0], X_train.shape[1], 1))
X_test = X_test.reshape((X_test.shape[0], X_test.shape[1], 1))

# Build and train the model
model = build_sequence_model((seq_length, 1))
history = model.fit(
    X_train, y_train,
    epochs=20,
    batch_size=32,
    validation_split=0.1,
    verbose=1
)

# Evaluate on test data
loss = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test)
print(f"Test loss: {loss}")

# Make predictions
predictions = model.predict(X_test)

# Inverse transform to get original scale
y_test_inv = scaler.inverse_transform(y_test)
predictions_inv = scaler.inverse_transform(predictions)

# Plot results
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
plt.plot(y_test_inv, label='Actual')
plt.plot(predictions_inv, label='Predicted')
plt.title('Time Series Prediction')
plt.xlabel('Time Step')
plt.ylabel('Value')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

This example:
1. Generates synthetic time series data with trend, seasonal components, and noise
2. Normalizes the data using `MinMaxScaler`
3. Creates sequences of 30 time steps to predict the next value
4. Builds and trains a model with two LSTM layers
5. Evaluates the model on test data
6. Visualizes the actual vs. predicted values

## Example: Text Generation with RNNs

Another common application of sequence modeling is text generation. Here's a simplified example:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Sample text (small for demonstration purposes)
text = """
TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.
It has a comprehensive, flexible ecosystem of tools, libraries, and community resources
that lets researchers push the state-of-the-art in ML and developers
easily build and deploy ML-powered applications.
"""

# Create character mapping
chars = sorted(list(set(text)))
char_to_idx = {c: i for i, c in enumerate(chars)}
idx_to_char = {i: c for i, c in enumerate(chars)}

# Create sequences
seq_length = 30
sequences = []
next_chars = []

for i in range(0, len(text) - seq_length):
    sequences.append(text[i:i+seq_length])
    next_chars.append(text[i+seq_length])

# One-hot encode sequences
X = np.zeros((len(sequences), seq_length, len(chars)), dtype=np.bool)
y = np.zeros((len(sequences), len(chars)), dtype=np.bool)

for i, sequence in enumerate(sequences):
    for t, char in enumerate(sequence):
        X[i, t, char_to_idx[char]] = 1
    y[i, char_to_idx[next_chars[i]]] = 1

# Build model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.LSTM(128, input_shape=(seq_length, len(chars))),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(len(chars), activation='softmax')
])

model.compile(loss='categorical_crossentropy', optimizer='adam')

# Train model (uncomment to actually train, this would normally require more epochs)
# model.fit(X, y, batch_size=128, epochs=20)

# Function to generate text
def generate_text(seed_text, length=100, temperature=0.5):
    """Generate text based on the seed text"""
    generated = seed_text
    
    for _ in range(length):
        # Convert the seed text to a sequence of one-hot vectors
        x_pred = np.zeros((1, seq_length, len(chars)))
        for t, char in enumerate(seed_text):
            if char in char_to_idx:
                x_pred[0, t, char_to_idx[char]] = 1
        
        # Make predictions
        preds = model.predict(x_pred, verbose=0)[0]
        
        # Apply temperature
        preds = np.log(preds) / temperature
        exp_preds = np.exp(preds)
        preds = exp_preds / np.sum(exp_preds)
        
        # Sample the next character
        next_index = np.random.choice(len(chars), p=preds)
        next_char = idx_to_char[next_index]
        
        # Add the character to the generated text
        generated += next_char
        seed_text = seed_text[1:] + next_char
    
    return generated

# Example of text generation (this would only work after training)
# new_text = generate_text("TensorFlow is", length=100)
# print(new_text)
```

This example demonstrates:
1. Creating a character-level language model
2. One-hot encoding text data
3. Using an LSTM to learn patterns in text
4. Creating a function to generate new text based on a seed

## Using Bidirectional RNNs

Sometimes, understanding a sequence requires information from both past and future elements. Bidirectional RNNs process sequences in both forward and backward directions:

```python
# Create a bidirectional LSTM
bidirectional_lstm = tf.keras.layers.Bidirectional(
    tf.keras.layers.LSTM(64, return_sequences=True)
)

# Process input
bi_output = bidirectional_lstm(sample_input)
print("Bidirectional LSTM output shape:", bi_output.shape)
```

**Output:**
```
Bidirectional LSTM output shape: (2, 3, 128)
```

Note that the output dimension is doubled (128 instead of 64) because it combines outputs from both directions.

## Handling Variable-Length Sequences

Real-world sequence data often has varying lengths. To handle this, we use padding and masking:

```python
# Create sequences of different lengths
sequences = [
    [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
    [1, 2],
    [1, 2, 3, 4],
    [1]
]

# Pad sequences to the same length
padded_sequences = tf.keras.preprocessing.sequence.pad_sequences(
    sequences,
    padding='post',  # Add padding at the end
    maxlen=5         # Max sequence length
)

print("Padded sequences:")
print(padded_sequences)

# Create a model with masking
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    # Masking layer ignores padded values (0s)
    tf.keras.layers.Masking(mask_value=0, input_shape=(5, 1)),
    tf.keras.layers.LSTM(64),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10)
])

# Summary of the model
model.summary()
```

**Output:**
```
Padded sequences:
[[1 2 3 4 5]
 [1 2 0 0 0]
 [1 2 3 4 0]
 [1 0 0 0 0]]

Model: "sequential"
