# TensorFlow GRU

## Introduction

Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) are a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture that have gained popularity as an alternative to traditional RNNs and even Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs). Introduced in 2014 by Cho et al., GRUs were designed to solve the vanishing gradient problem that standard RNNs face when dealing with long sequences.

In this tutorial, we will:
- Understand what GRUs are and how they differ from standard RNNs and LSTMs
- Learn about the internal structure of GRU cells
- Implement GRU layers in TensorFlow
- Build a complete GRU model for practical sequence processing tasks

## What is a GRU?

A Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) is a gating mechanism in recurrent neural networks that has fewer parameters than LSTM but can achieve comparable performance for many tasks. Like LSTMs, GRUs are designed to capture dependencies over long sequences by using gates that control the flow of information.

### GRU Architecture

GRU uses two gates:
1. **Update Gate**: Decides how much of the previous memory to keep
2. **Reset Gate**: Decides how much of the previous memory to forget

This is simpler compared to the LSTM, which has three gates (input, forget, and output gates). Let's visualize the internal structure:

```
            ┌─────┐
            │     │
            │  σ  │  Update Gate
            │     │
            └─────┘
               ↑
h_{t-1} ──────┬─────────┐
               │         │
               ↓         ↓
            ┌─────┐     │
            │     │     │
            │  σ  │     │  Reset Gate
            │     │     │
            └─────┘     │
               ↑        ↓
x_t ──────────┴────────┬───→ h_t  (Output/Hidden state)
```

## How GRU Works

In mathematical terms, here's how a GRU cell processes inputs:

1. The update gate `z_t` is calculated as:
   ```
   z_t = σ(W_z·[h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_z)
   ```

2. The reset gate `r_t` is calculated as:
   ```
   r_t = σ(W_r·[h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_r)
   ```

3. The candidate hidden state `h̃_t` is:
   ```
   h̃_t = tanh(W·[r_t * h_{t-1}, x_t] + b)
   ```

4. Finally, the new hidden state `h_t` is:
   ```
   h_t = (1 - z_t) * h_{t-1} + z_t * h̃_t
   ```

Where:
- `σ` is the sigmoid activation function
- `*` denotes element-wise multiplication
- `W_z`, `W_r`, `W` are weight matrices
- `b_z`, `b_r`, `b` are bias vectors

## Implementing GRU in TensorFlow

TensorFlow makes it easy to implement GRU layers using the `tf.keras.layers.GRU` class. Let's start with a simple example:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import GRU, Dense

# Create a simple GRU model
model = Sequential([
    # GRU layer with 64 units
    GRU(64, input_shape=(sequence_length, features)),
    # Output layer
    Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

model.compile(
    optimizer='adam',
    loss='categorical_crossentropy',
    metrics=['accuracy']
)

model.summary()
```

The output of `model.summary()` would look something like:

```
Model: "sequential"
_________________________________________________________________
Layer (type)                 Output Shape              Param #   
=================================================================
gru (GRU)                    (None, 64)                20736     
_________________________________________________________________
dense (Dense)                (None, 10)                650       
=================================================================
Total params: 21,386
Trainable params: 21,386
Non-trainable params: 0
_________________________________________________________________
```

## GRU Hyperparameters

When working with the `GRU` layer in TensorFlow, you can customize various parameters:

```python
tf.keras.layers.GRU(
    units,                 # Number of neurons in the GRU cell
    activation='tanh',     # Activation function for the output
    recurrent_activation='sigmoid',  # Activation for recurrent step
    use_bias=True,         # Whether to use bias vectors
    return_sequences=False,  # Return output for each timestep if True
    return_state=False,    # Return final state along with output if True
    stateful=False,        # If True, batch's final state is used as initial state for next batch
    dropout=0.0,           # Dropout rate for inputs
    recurrent_dropout=0.0, # Dropout rate for recurrent connections
    # ... and other parameters
)
```

## Practical Example: Time Series Forecasting

Let's implement a GRU network for time series forecasting. We'll create a model that predicts the next value in a time series based on previous values.

```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import GRU, Dense
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Generate a simple time series (sine wave with noise)
time = np.arange(0, 100, 0.1)
series = np.sin(time) + np.random.normal(0, 0.1, size=len(time))

# Create input-output pairs for training
def create_dataset(data, time_steps=10):
    X, y = [], []
    for i in range(len(data) - time_steps):
        X.append(data[i:i + time_steps])
        y.append(data[i + time_steps])
    return np.array(X), np.array(y)

# Prepare data
time_steps = 20
X, y = create_dataset(series, time_steps)
X = X.reshape((X.shape[0], X.shape[1], 1))  # reshape for GRU input

# Split into train and test sets
train_size = int(len(X) * 0.8)
X_train, X_test = X[:train_size], X[train_size:]
y_train, y_test = y[:train_size], y[train_size:]

# Build GRU model
model = Sequential([
    GRU(50, activation='relu', input_shape=(time_steps, 1), return_sequences=True),
    GRU(50, activation='relu'),
    Dense(1)
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')

# Train model
history = model.fit(
    X_train, y_train,
    epochs=20,
    batch_size=32,
    validation_split=0.2,
    verbose=1
)

# Evaluate model
loss = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test)
print(f"Test Loss: {loss}")

# Make predictions
predictions = model.predict(X_test)

# Plot results
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
plt.plot(y_test, label='Actual')
plt.plot(predictions, label='Predicted')
plt.legend()
plt.title('GRU Time Series Forecasting')
plt.show()
```

This code will:
1. Generate a simple sine wave with noise
2. Create input-output pairs for sequence prediction
3. Train a GRU model with two layers
4. Evaluate the model and visualize predictions

## Stacked GRU Example

For more complex problems, we can stack multiple GRU layers:

```python
model = Sequential([
    # First GRU layer with return_sequences=True to connect to the next GRU layer
    GRU(100, activation='relu', input_shape=(sequence_length, features), return_sequences=True),
    # Second GRU layer
    GRU(50, activation='relu'),
    # Output layer
    Dense(1)
])
```

## Bidirectional GRU

For sequences where information from both past and future is relevant, we can use bidirectional GRUs:

```python
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Bidirectional

model = Sequential([
    # Bidirectional GRU processes the sequence in both directions
    Bidirectional(GRU(50, activation='relu'), input_shape=(sequence_length, features)),
    Dense(1)
])
```

## Text Classification with GRU

Let's implement a GRU for sentiment analysis on text data:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.text import Tokenizer
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.sequence import pad_sequences
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Embedding, GRU, Dense, Dropout

# Sample data
texts = ['I love this movie', 'This was terrible', 'Great film, highly recommended',
         'Waste of time', 'Amazing experience', 'Very disappointing']
labels = [1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0]  # 1 for positive, 0 for negative

# Tokenize the texts
max_words = 1000
max_len = 20

tokenizer = Tokenizer(num_words=max_words)
tokenizer.fit_on_texts(texts)
sequences = tokenizer.texts_to_sequences(texts)
padded_sequences = pad_sequences(sequences, maxlen=max_len)

# Create the model
model = Sequential([
    # Embedding layer
    Embedding(max_words, 16, input_length=max_len),
    # GRU layer
    GRU(32, dropout=0.2, recurrent_dropout=0.2),
    # Output layer
    Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

model.compile(
    optimizer='adam',
    loss='binary_crossentropy',
    metrics=['accuracy']
)

# Train the model
model.fit(
    padded_sequences, labels,
    epochs=20,
    batch_size=2,
    validation_split=0.2
)

# Test with new data
new_texts = ['I enjoyed watching this', 'Would not recommend']
new_sequences = tokenizer.texts_to_sequences(new_texts)
new_padded = pad_sequences(new_sequences, maxlen=max_len)

predictions = model.predict(new_padded)
print("Predictions:")
for i, text in enumerate(new_texts):
    sentiment = "positive" if predictions[i] > 0.5 else "negative"
    print(f"'{text}' - {sentiment} ({predictions[i][0]:.2f})")
```

## GRU vs LSTM: Which to Choose?

GRUs have several advantages compared to LSTMs:
- **Fewer parameters**: GRUs have 2 gates instead of 3, meaning fewer weights to train
- **Faster training**: With fewer parameters comes faster training times
- **Good for smaller datasets**: Often performs better on smaller datasets where overfitting is a concern

However, LSTMs might be better for:
- Very long sequences where more fine-grained memory control is beneficial
- Complex problems where the additional capacity of LSTM helps

In practice, it's often good to try both architectures and compare their performance for your specific task.

## Best Practices for GRU Networks

1. **Sequence preprocessing**: Normalize your sequence data and consider appropriate padding/masking strategies
2. **Hyperparameter tuning**:
   - Experiment with different numbers of GRU units
   - Try different activation functions
   - Tune dropout rates to prevent overfitting
3. **Gradient clipping**: Consider using gradient clipping to prevent exploding gradients
4. **Stateful vs stateless**: Understand when to use stateful GRUs for continuous sequence processing
5. **Bidirectionality**: Consider bidirectional GRUs when future context is also important
