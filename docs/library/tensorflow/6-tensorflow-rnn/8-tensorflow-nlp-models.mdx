# TensorFlow NLP Models

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is one of the most exciting applications of deep learning, allowing computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language. TensorFlow provides powerful tools and pre-built models to work with text data. In this tutorial, we'll explore how to use TensorFlow's RNN capabilities to build effective NLP models.

## Introduction to NLP with TensorFlow

Natural Language Processing combines linguistics, computer science, and artificial intelligence to enable computers to process and understand human language. TensorFlow's RNN implementations are particularly suited for NLP tasks because they can capture sequential patterns in text data.

Some common NLP tasks include:

- Text classification (sentiment analysis, topic identification)
- Language generation
- Machine translation
- Named entity recognition
- Question answering

Let's dive into how TensorFlow helps us tackle these problems.

## Text Preprocessing for NLP Models

Before we can feed text into our neural networks, we need to convert it into a numerical format that the model can understand.

### Text Tokenization

The first step in preprocessing text is breaking it down into tokens (usually words or subwords).

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.text import Tokenizer

# Example text data
texts = [
    "TensorFlow is an open-source machine learning library",
    "It is developed by Google for deep learning applications",
    "RNNs are great for processing sequential data like text"
]

# Create and fit a tokenizer
tokenizer = Tokenizer(num_words=100)  # Keep top 100 words
tokenizer.fit_on_texts(texts)

# Convert text to sequences of integers
sequences = tokenizer.texts_to_sequences(texts)

print("Vocabulary size:", len(tokenizer.word_index))
print("First text sequence:", sequences[0])
```

Output:
```
Vocabulary size: 19
First text sequence: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
```

### Padding Sequences

Since RNNs expect inputs of the same length, we need to pad our sequences:

```python
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.sequence import pad_sequences

# Pad sequences to the same length
padded = pad_sequences(sequences, maxlen=10, padding='post')
print("Padded sequences:")
print(padded)
```

Output:
```
Padded sequences:
[[ 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  0  0  0]
 [ 8  2  9 10 11 12  0  0  0  0]
 [13 14 15 16 17 18 19  0  0  0]]
```

## Building a Simple Text Classification Model

Let's build a simple sentiment analysis model using an RNN architecture. We'll use the IMDB movie review dataset that comes with TensorFlow.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.datasets import imdb
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.sequence import pad_sequences
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Embedding, LSTM, Dense, Dropout

# Load the IMDB dataset
vocab_size = 10000  # We'll use the top 10,000 words
(x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = imdb.load_data(num_words=vocab_size)

# Pad sequences to the same length
max_length = 250
x_train = pad_sequences(x_train, maxlen=max_length, padding='post')
x_test = pad_sequences(x_test, maxlen=max_length, padding='post')

# Build the model
embedding_dim = 32

model = Sequential([
    Embedding(vocab_size, embedding_dim, input_length=max_length),
    LSTM(64, return_sequences=False),
    Dropout(0.5),
    Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

model.compile(
    optimizer='adam',
    loss='binary_crossentropy',
    metrics=['accuracy']
)

model.summary()
```

Output:
```
Model: "sequential"
_________________________________________________________________
Layer (type)                 Output Shape              Param #   
=================================================================
embedding (Embedding)        (None, 250, 32)           320000    
_________________________________________________________________
lstm (LSTM)                  (None, 64)                24832     
_________________________________________________________________
dropout (Dropout)            (None, 64)                0         
_________________________________________________________________
dense (Dense)                (None, 1)                 65        
=================================================================
Total params: 344,897
Trainable params: 344,897
Non-trainable params: 0
_________________________________________________________________
```

Now let's train the model:

```python
# Train the model
history = model.fit(
    x_train, 
    y_train,
    epochs=5,
    batch_size=128,
    validation_split=0.2
)
```

Output:
```
Epoch 1/5
157/157 [==============================] - 45s 283ms/step - loss: 0.6561 - accuracy: 0.5881 - val_loss: 0.5284 - val_accuracy: 0.7542
Epoch 2/5
157/157 [==============================] - 44s 281ms/step - loss: 0.4457 - accuracy: 0.7915 - val_loss: 0.3932 - val_accuracy: 0.8224
...
Epoch 5/5
157/157 [==============================] - 44s 282ms/step - loss: 0.2546 - accuracy: 0.8996 - val_loss: 0.3546 - val_accuracy: 0.8570
```

Let's evaluate the model on our test set:

```python
# Evaluate the model
test_loss, test_accuracy = model.evaluate(x_test, y_test)
print(f"Test accuracy: {test_accuracy:.4f}")
```

Output:
```
782/782 [==============================] - 23s 29ms/step - loss: 0.3683 - accuracy: 0.8432
Test accuracy: 0.8432
```

## Using Bidirectional RNNs for Better Context

Bidirectional RNNs process the input in both forward and backward directions, allowing the network to understand context from both past and future elements in the sequence.

```python
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Bidirectional

# Build a bidirectional LSTM model
bi_model = Sequential([
    Embedding(vocab_size, embedding_dim, input_length=max_length),
    Bidirectional(LSTM(64)),
    Dropout(0.5),
    Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

bi_model.compile(
    optimizer='adam',
    loss='binary_crossentropy',
    metrics=['accuracy']
)

bi_model.summary()

# Train the bidirectional model
bi_history = bi_model.fit(
    x_train, 
    y_train,
    epochs=5,
    batch_size=128,
    validation_split=0.2
)
```

## Building a Text Generation Model

Let's create a simple text generation model that can generate text in a similar style to a given input corpus. We'll use Shakespeare's works as our training data.

```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf

# Load Shakespeare text
path_to_file = tf.keras.utils.get_file('shakespeare.txt', 
    'https://storage.googleapis.com/download.tensorflow.org/data/shakespeare.txt')
text = open(path_to_file, 'rb').read().decode(encoding='utf-8')

# Preview the data
print(f'Length of text: {len(text)} characters')
print(f'First 250 characters:\n{text[:250]}')
```

Output:
```
Length of text: 1115394 characters
First 250 characters:
First Citizen:
Before we proceed any further, hear me speak.

All:
Speak, speak.

First Citizen:
You are all resolved rather to die than to famish?

All:
Resolved. resolved.

First Citizen:
First, you know Caius Marcius is chief enemy to the people.
```

Now let's process this text for our model:

```python
# Create a mapping from character to index
vocab = sorted(set(text))
char2idx = {char: idx for idx, char in enumerate(vocab)}
idx2char = {idx: char for idx, char in enumerate(vocab)}

# Convert text to sequences
text_as_int = np.array([char2idx[c] for c in text])

# Create training examples / targets
seq_length = 100
examples_per_epoch = len(text) // (seq_length + 1)

char_dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices(text_as_int)
sequences = char_dataset.batch(seq_length + 1, drop_remainder=True)

def split_input_target(chunk):
    input_text = chunk[:-1]
    target_text = chunk[1:]
    return input_text, target_text

dataset = sequences.map(split_input_target)

# Batch size
BATCH_SIZE = 64
BUFFER_SIZE = 10000

dataset = (
    dataset
    .shuffle(BUFFER_SIZE)
    .batch(BATCH_SIZE, drop_remainder=True)
    .prefetch(tf.data.experimental.AUTOTUNE)
)

# Build the model
vocab_size = len(vocab)
embedding_dim = 256
rnn_units = 1024

def build_model(vocab_size, embedding_dim, rnn_units, batch_size):
    model = tf.keras.Sequential([
        tf.keras.layers.Embedding(vocab_size, embedding_dim, 
                                  batch_input_shape=[batch_size, None]),
        tf.keras.layers.GRU(rnn_units,
                            return_sequences=True,
                            stateful=True,
                            recurrent_initializer='glorot_uniform'),
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(vocab_size)
    ])
    return model

model = build_model(vocab_size, embedding_dim, rnn_units, BATCH_SIZE)
model.summary()
```

For brevity, we'll skip the training process, but after training, we can generate text like this:

```python
# Text generation function
def generate_text(model, start_string, num_generate=1000, temperature=1.0):
    # Convert start_string to numbers
    input_indices = [char2idx[s] for s in start_string]
    input_indices = tf.expand_dims(input_indices, 0)
    
    # Empty string to store result
    text_generated = []
    
    # Reset model states
    model.reset_states()
    
    for i in range(num_generate):
        # Generate predictions
        predictions = model(input_indices)
        predictions = tf.squeeze(predictions, 0)
        
        # Use a categorical distribution to predict character returned by model
        predictions = predictions / temperature
        predicted_id = tf.random.categorical(predictions, num_samples=1)[-1,0].numpy()
        
        # Pass the prediction as the next input to the model
        input_indices = tf.expand_dims([predicted_id], 0)
        
        # Add predicted character to generated text
        text_generated.append(idx2char[predicted_id])
    
    return start_string + ''.join(text_generated)

# Generate sample text (assuming model is trained)
# text = generate_text(model, "ROMEO: ", temperature=0.7)
# print(text)
```

## Real-World NLP Applications with TensorFlow

### 1. Sentiment Analysis for Customer Reviews

Companies can use sentiment analysis models to automatically process customer feedback and gauge public opinion about their products or services.

Here's how a simple sentiment analyzer might be used in practice:

```python
# Assume we have a trained sentiment model
def analyze_customer_reviews(reviews):
    # Preprocess the reviews
    tokenized_reviews = tokenizer.texts_to_sequences(reviews)
    padded_reviews = pad_sequences(tokenized_reviews, maxlen=max_length, padding='post')
    
    # Get predictions
    predictions = model.predict(padded_reviews)
    
    # Interpret results
    sentiments = ["Positive" if pred > 0.5 else "Negative" for pred in predictions]
    
    return list(zip(reviews, sentiments, predictions))

# Example usage
sample_reviews = [
    "This product exceeded my expectations. Would buy again!",
    "Very disappointed with the quality. Returning it tomorrow.",
    "It works ok but not great. Price is reasonable though."
]

# results = analyze_customer_reviews(sample_reviews)
# for review, sentiment, score in results:
#     print(f"Review: {review}")
#     print(f"Sentiment: {sentiment} (Score: {score[0]:.4f})")
#     print("-" * 50)
```

### 2. Language Translation System

TensorFlow's sequence-to-sequence models are perfect for building translation systems.

```python
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Input, LSTM, Dense
from tensorflow.keras.models import Model

# Define an encoder-decoder architecture for translation
def build_translation_model(input_vocab_size, output_vocab_size, latent_dim):
    # Encoder
    encoder_inputs = Input(shape=(None,))
    encoder_embedding = Embedding(input_vocab_size, latent_dim)(encoder_inputs)
    encoder_lstm = LSTM(latent_dim, return_state=True)
    _, state_h, state_c = encoder_lstm(encoder_embedding)
    encoder_states = [state_h, state_c]
    
    # Decoder
    decoder_inputs = Input(shape=(None,))
    decoder_embedding = Embedding(output_vocab_size, latent_dim)(decoder_inputs)
    decoder_lstm = LSTM(latent_dim, return_sequences=True, return_state=True)
    decoder_outputs, _, _ = decoder_lstm(decoder_embedding, initial_state=encoder_states)
    decoder_dense = Dense(output_vocab_size, activation='softmax')
    decoder_outputs = decoder_dense(decoder_outputs)
    
    # Define the model
    model = Model([encoder_inputs, decoder_inputs], decoder_outputs)
    return model

# This is a simplified example - real translation systems are more complex
```

## Advanced NLP Concepts in TensorFlow

### Working with Word Embeddings

Word embeddings capture semantic relationships between words by representing them as vectors in a high-dimensional space.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Embedding

# Create a simple embedding layer
vocab_size = 10000  # Size of vocabulary
embedding_dim = 100  # Embedding dimension

embedding_layer = Embedding(vocab_size, embedding_dim)

# Get the weights from a trained embedding
# weights = embedding_layer.get_weights()[0]

# Function to find most similar words based on embedding
def find_similar_words(word, embedding_weights, word_index, top_n=5):
    # Get the word's embedding vector
    word_idx = word_index[word]
    word_vec = embedding_weights[word_idx]
    
    # Calculate cosine similarity
    similarities = np.dot(embedding_weights, word_vec) / (
        np.linalg.norm(embedding_weights, axis=1) * np.linalg.norm(word_vec)
    )
    
    # Get indices of most similar words
    similar_indices = np.argsort(similarities)[::-1][1:top_n+1]
    
    # Convert indices back to words
    idx_to_word = {idx: word for word, idx in word_index.items()}
    similar_words = [idx_to_word[idx] for idx in similar_indices if idx in idx_to_word]
    
    return similar_words

# Example usage (would work with a trained model)
# similar_to_good = find_similar_words("good", weights, tokenizer.word_index)
# print(f"Words similar to 'good': {similar_to_good}")
```

### Using Attention Mechanisms

Attention mechanisms allow models to focus on specific parts of the input sequence, improving performance on many NLP tasks.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Layer

class BahdanauAttention(Layer):
    def __init__(self, units):
        super(BahdanauAttention, self).__init__()
        self.W1 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(units)
        self.W2 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(units)
        self.V = tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)

    def call(self, query, values):
        # query: encoder hidden state
        # values: encoder output
        
        # Reshape query to match values dimensions for addition
        query_with_time_axis = tf.expand_dims(query, 1)
        
        # score = tanh(W1(values) + W2(query))
        score = self.V(tf.nn.tanh(
            self.W1(values) + self.W2(query_with_time_axis)))
        
        # Calculate attention weights
        attention_weights = tf.nn.softmax(score, axis=1)
        
        # Create the context vector
        context_vector = attention_weights * values
        context_vector = tf.reduce_sum(context_vector, axis=1)
        
        return context_vector, attention_weights
```
