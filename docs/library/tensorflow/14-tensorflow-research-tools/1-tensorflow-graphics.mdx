# TensorFlow Graphics

## Introduction

TensorFlow Graphics is a specialized library that extends TensorFlow's capabilities into the realm of computer graphics. It provides differentiable graphics layers that allow you to integrate 3D computer graphics operations within your machine learning workflows. This powerful integration enables exciting applications like neural rendering, 3D object reconstruction, pose estimation, and more.

What makes TensorFlow Graphics particularly valuable is that all of its operations are differentiable, meaning gradients can flow through the graphics operations. This allows the training of models that incorporate 3D data and rendering processes using standard optimization techniques.

In this guide, we'll explore TensorFlow Graphics from the ground up, starting with installation and working our way through fundamental concepts with practical examples.

## Getting Started with TensorFlow Graphics

### Installation

Let's begin by installing TensorFlow Graphics:

```bash
pip install tensorflow-graphics
```

You'll also need to have TensorFlow installed. If you haven't already:

```bash
pip install tensorflow
```

### Basic Imports

To start using TensorFlow Graphics, import the necessary modules:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import tensorflow_graphics as tfg
import tensorflow_graphics.geometry.transformation as tfg_transformation
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

## Core Concepts in TensorFlow Graphics

### 1. 3D Transformations

One of the most fundamental operations in computer graphics is transforming 3D points. TensorFlow Graphics provides differentiable implementations of common transformations.

#### Rotation Example

Let's see how to rotate a 3D point using Euler angles:

```python
# Define a 3D point
point = tf.constant([[1.0, 0.0, 0.0]], dtype=tf.float32)

# Define rotation angles in radians (x, y, z)
euler_angles = tf.constant([[0.0, 0.0, np.pi/2]], dtype=tf.float32)  # 90 degrees around z-axis

# Convert Euler angles to rotation matrix
rotation_matrix = tfg_transformation.euler.from_euler(euler_angles)

# Apply rotation to the point
rotated_point = tf.matmul(point, rotation_matrix, transpose_b=True)

print("Original point:", point.numpy())
print("Rotation matrix:\n", rotation_matrix.numpy())
print("Rotated point:", rotated_point.numpy())
```

**Output:**
```
Original point: [[1. 0. 0.]]
Rotation matrix:
 [[[0.        -1.        0.       ]
  [1.         0.        0.       ]
  [0.         0.        1.       ]]]
Rotated point: [[0. 1. 0.]]
```

This example rotates a point at (1,0,0) by 90 degrees around the z-axis, resulting in the point (0,1,0).

### 2. Camera Models

TensorFlow Graphics implements various camera models that transform 3D points into 2D image coordinates.

#### Perspective Projection Example

Let's see how to project 3D points onto a 2D image plane using a perspective camera model:

```python
import tensorflow_graphics.rendering.camera as tfg_camera

# 3D points in world space (batch of 3 points)
points_3d = tf.constant([
    [0.0, 0.0, 5.0],   # Point straight ahead
    [1.0, 1.0, 5.0],   # Point up and to the right
    [-1.0, -1.0, 5.0]  # Point down and to the left
], dtype=tf.float32)

# Camera parameters
focal_length = tf.constant([1.0, 1.0], dtype=tf.float32)  # fx, fy
principal_point = tf.constant([0.0, 0.0], dtype=tf.float32)  # cx, cy

# Project 3D points to 2D
points_2d = tfg_camera.perspective.project(points_3d, focal_length, principal_point)

print("3D points:", points_3d.numpy())
print("2D projections:", points_2d.numpy())
```

**Output:**
```
3D points: [[ 0.  0.  5.]
 [ 1.  1.  5.]
 [-1. -1.  5.]]
2D projections: [[ 0.     0.   ]
 [ 0.2    0.2  ]
 [-0.2   -0.2  ]]
```

This code projects three 3D points onto a 2D image plane using a perspective camera model.

### 3. Mesh Representation and Operations

TensorFlow Graphics provides tools to work with 3D meshes, which are collections of vertices, edges, and faces that define 3D objects.

#### Mesh Normals Example

Computing face normals is a common operation in 3D graphics:

```python
import tensorflow_graphics.geometry.representation as tfg_representation

# Define a triangle mesh (a simple pyramid with 4 triangular faces)
vertices = tf.constant([
    [0.0, 0.0, 1.0],  # Top vertex
    [1.0, 0.0, 0.0],  # Bottom right
    [0.0, 1.0, 0.0],  # Bottom back
    [-1.0, 0.0, 0.0]  # Bottom left
], dtype=tf.float32)

# Define the triangular faces using vertex indices
triangles = tf.constant([
    [0, 1, 2],  # Face 1
    [0, 2, 3],  # Face 2
    [0, 3, 1],  # Face 3
    [1, 3, 2]   # Face 4 (bottom face)
], dtype=tf.int32)

# Compute face normals
face_normals = tfg_representation.triangle.normal(vertices, triangles)

print("Face normals:\n", face_normals.numpy())
```

**Output:**
```
Face normals:
 [[ 0.70710677  0.         -0.70710677]
 [ 0.          0.70710677 -0.70710677]
 [-0.70710677  0.         -0.70710677]
 [ 0.          0.         -1.        ]]
```

Each row in the output represents a normalized normal vector for one of the triangular faces of our pyramid.

## Advanced Topics

### Differentiable Rendering

One of the most powerful features of TensorFlow Graphics is its ability to perform differentiable rendering, which allows gradients to flow from rendered images back to 3D scene parameters.

#### Simple Rasterization Example

Here's a simplified example of rendering a mesh using TensorFlow Graphics:

```python
import tensorflow_graphics.rendering.rasterization as tfg_rasterization

# Assume we have already defined vertices and triangles for a mesh
# For this example, we'll reuse the pyramid from earlier

# Camera parameters
camera_position = tf.constant([[0.0, -2.0, 0.5]], dtype=tf.float32)
look_at_point = tf.constant([[0.0, 0.0, 0.0]], dtype=tf.float32)
up_vector = tf.constant([[0.0, 0.0, 1.0]], dtype=tf.float32)

# Create a simple perspective camera with 90-degree field of view
fov = tf.constant(np.pi / 2.0)  # 90 degrees
aspect_ratio = tf.constant(1.0)  # Square image
near_plane = tf.constant(0.01)
far_plane = tf.constant(10.0)

# Create view and projection matrices
view_matrix = tfg_transformation.look_at.right_handed(camera_position, look_at_point, up_vector)
projection_matrix = tfg_camera.perspective.right_handed(fov, aspect_ratio, near_plane, far_plane)

# Transform vertices to clip space
model_matrix = tf.eye(4, batch_shape=[1])  # Identity matrix (no model transformation)
vertices_homogeneous = tfg.geometry.representation.Mesh.homogenize(vertices)[None, ...]  # Add batch dimension
mvp_matrix = tf.matmul(projection_matrix, tf.matmul(view_matrix, model_matrix))
vertices_clip_space = tf.matmul(vertices_homogeneous, mvp_matrix, transpose_b=True)[..., :3]

# Rasterization parameters
image_size = 256
batch_size = 1

# Prepare data for rasterizer
vertices_expanded = tf.tile(vertices_clip_space, [batch_size, 1, 1])
triangles_expanded = tf.tile(triangles[None, ...], [batch_size, 1, 1])

# Define color for each vertex (RGBA)
vertex_colors = tf.constant([
    [1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0],  # Red (top)
    [0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0],  # Green
    [0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0],  # Blue
    [1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0]   # Yellow
], dtype=tf.float32)
vertex_colors_expanded = tf.tile(vertex_colors[None, ...], [batch_size, 1, 1])

# Render the mesh
rendered_image = tfg_rasterization.rasterize(
    vertices_expanded, 
    triangles_expanded,
    vertex_colors_expanded, 
    image_size, image_size
)

# Display the result
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 10))
plt.imshow(rendered_image[0].numpy())
plt.axis('off')
plt.title('Rendered Pyramid')
plt.show()
```

This code renders a colorful pyramid from a specific camera viewpoint. The resulting image would show the pyramid with each face having interpolated colors from its vertices.

### Neural 3D Mesh Reconstruction

TensorFlow Graphics enables training neural networks that can reconstruct 3D meshes from images. Here's a simplified illustration of how you might set up such a pipeline:

```python
# This is a conceptual example and would need additional components to run
def create_mesh_reconstruction_model():
    # Create an encoder to process input images
    encoder = tf.keras.Sequential([
        tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(64, kernel_size=3, strides=2, padding='same', activation='relu'),
        tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(128, kernel_size=3, strides=2, padding='same', activation='relu'),
        tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(256, kernel_size=3, strides=2, padding='same', activation='relu'),
        tf.keras.layers.Flatten(),
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(512, activation='relu'),
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(256)  # Latent space
    ])
    
    # Create a decoder that outputs mesh vertices
    # For simplicity, we assume a fixed topology with 42 vertices (14 triangles)
    decoder = tf.keras.Sequential([
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(512, activation='relu', input_shape=(256,)),
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(1024, activation='relu'),
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(42 * 3)  # 42 vertices, each with x,y,z coordinates
    ])
    
    # Create model
    image_input = tf.keras.Input(shape=(256, 256, 3))
    latent = encoder(image_input)
    vertices_flat = decoder(latent)
    vertices = tf.reshape(vertices_flat, (-1, 42, 3))
    
    # Return the full model
    return tf.keras.Model(inputs=image_input, outputs=vertices)

# Create a loss function that compares rendered images to target images
def mesh_reconstruction_loss(target_images, predicted_vertices, triangles):
    # Use TensorFlow Graphics to render the predicted mesh
    rendered_images = render_mesh(predicted_vertices, triangles)
    
    # Image reconstruction loss
    image_loss = tf.reduce_mean(tf.square(target_images - rendered_images))
    
    # Add regularization for mesh smoothness
    laplacian_loss = compute_laplacian_smoothing_loss(predicted_vertices, triangles)
    
    # Total loss
    total_loss = image_loss + 0.1 * laplacian_loss
    return total_loss
```

This conceptual example shows how you might structure a neural network that takes in images and outputs 3D mesh vertices. The network could be trained by comparing rendered images of the predicted mesh to the input images.

## Practical Applications

### 1. 3D Object Pose Estimation

TensorFlow Graphics can be used to estimate the 3D pose of objects in images. This is crucial for applications like augmented reality and robotic manipulation.

```python
def create_pose_estimation_model(num_keypoints):
    # Create a model that detects keypoints in an image
    base_model = tf.keras.applications.MobileNetV2(
        include_top=False, 
        input_shape=(224, 224, 3),
        weights='imagenet'
    )
    
    x = base_model.output
    x = tf.keras.layers.GlobalAveragePooling2D()(x)
    x = tf.keras.layers.Dense(1024, activation='relu')(x)
    
    # Output keypoint locations (x, y coordinates for each keypoint)
    keypoint_output = tf.keras.layers.Dense(num_keypoints * 2)(x)
    keypoint_output = tf.keras.layers.Reshape((num_keypoints, 2))(keypoint_output)
    
    # Create a model from input image to keypoint predictions
    keypoint_model = tf.keras.Model(inputs=base_model.input, outputs=keypoint_output)
    
    # Add a PnP (Perspective-n-Point) layer from TensorFlow Graphics
    # This estimates pose from 2D-3D correspondences
    camera_params = tf.keras.Input(shape=(4,))  # Focal lengths and principal point
    known_3d_keypoints = tf.keras.Input(shape=(num_keypoints, 3))
    
    # Estimate pose using PnP algorithm
    pose = tfg.geometry.transformation.pose.EPnP()(
        keypoint_output, known_3d_keypoints, camera_params
    )
    
    # Final model: image → 2D keypoints → 3D pose
    final_model = tf.keras.Model(
        inputs=[base_model.input, known_3d_keypoints, camera_params], 
        outputs=[keypoint_output, pose]
    )
    
    return final_model
```

This example shows how you might structure a deep learning model that predicts 3D poses from images using TensorFlow Graphics' EPnP algorithm.

### 2. Neural Rendering for Novel View Synthesis

Neural rendering combines traditional rendering with neural networks to create photorealistic images from new viewpoints:

```python
def create_novel_view_synthesis_model():
    # Input: Current image and target camera pose
    input_image = tf.keras.Input(shape=(256, 256, 3))
    current_pose = tf.keras.Input(shape=(4, 4))  # 4x4 transformation matrix
    target_pose = tf.keras.Input(shape=(4, 4))
    
    # Encode input image to features
    x = tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(64, 3, padding='same', activation='relu')(input_image)
    x = tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(128, 3, strides=2, padding='same', activation='relu')(x)
    x = tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(256, 3, strides=2, padding='same', activation='relu')(x)
    
    # Create a feature volume
    volume_features = tf.keras.layers.Dense(32)(x)
    
    # Transform features from source to target view
    relative_pose = tfg_transformation.rotation_matrix_3d.inverse(current_pose) @ target_pose
    transformed_features = transform_feature_volume(volume_features, relative_pose)
    
    # Decoder to generate new view
    y = tf.keras.layers.Conv2DTranspose(128, 3, strides=2, padding='same', activation='relu')(transformed_features)
    y = tf.keras.layers.Conv2DTranspose(64, 3, strides=2, padding='same', activation='relu')(y)
    output_image = tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(3, 3, padding='same', activation='sigmoid')(y)
    
    # Create model
    model = tf.keras.Model(
        inputs=[input_image, current_pose, target_pose],
        outputs=output_image
    )
    
    return model
```

This conceptual example shows how TensorFlow Graphics can be used in a neural rendering pipeline to synthesize new views of a scene.
