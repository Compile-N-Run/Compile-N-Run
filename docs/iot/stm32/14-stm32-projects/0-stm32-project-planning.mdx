- Software modularity and component reuse
- Error handling strategy
- Testing methodology

**Example Software Architecture Plan:**

```c
// Project Structure for Smart Thermostat
/include
  /drivers            // Hardware-specific code
    temp_sensor.h     // Temperature sensor interface
    display.h         // LCD display driver
    wifi_module.h     // WiFi communication
  /middleware
    temp_control.h    // Temperature control algorithm
    user_interface.h  // User input handling
    settings.h        // Configuration storage
  /app
    main.h            // Application entry point
    app_config.h      // Project-wide configurations

/src
  // Implementation files for each module
```

### 6. Create a Project Timeline

Establish realistic milestones and deadlines:

1. **Development Setup**: Configure tools and environment (1-2 days)
2. **Hardware Integration**: Connect and test peripherals (1 week)
3. **Core Functionality**: Implement main features (2-3 weeks)
4. **Testing & Debugging**: Verify functionality (1-2 weeks)
5. **Optimization**: Improve performance and power usage (1 week)

    while (1) {
        // Read mode button
        current_mode = ReadButtonState();
        
        // Read potentiometer
        blink_rate = ReadPotValue();
        
        // Apply mode logic
        if (current_mode == MODE_1) {
            // Mode 1 blinking pattern
            ToggleLED();
        } else {
            // Mode 2 blinking pattern
            BlinkLEDWithPattern();
        }
        
        // Delay based on potentiometer value
        Delay(CalculateDelay(blink_rate));
    }
}
```

## Software Design Patterns for STM32

Consider these common patterns when planning your software architecture:

### State Machine

Ideal for systems with defined operational modes:

```c
typedef enum {
    STATE_IDLE,
    STATE_RUNNING,
    STATE_ERROR,
    STATE_SLEEP
} SystemState;

SystemState currentState = STATE_IDLE;

void main() {
    // Initialize system
    SystemInit();
    
    while (1) {
        switch (currentState) {
            case STATE_IDLE:
                // Handle idle state
                HandleIdleState();
                break;
                
            case STATE_RUNNING:
                // Handle running state
                HandleRunningState();
                break;
                
            case STATE_ERROR:
                // Handle error state
                HandleErrorState();
                break;
                
            case STATE_SLEEP:
                // Handle sleep state
                HandleSleepState();
                break;
        }
    }
}
```

### Interrupt-Based Architecture

For responsive systems that need to handle asynchronous events:

```c
// Configure interrupts in initialization
void InitSystem() {
    // Configure button interrupt
    HAL_GPIO_Init(BUTTON_GPIO_Port, &GPIO_InitStruct);
    HAL_NVIC_SetPriority(BUTTON_EXTI_IRQn, 0, 0);
    HAL_NVIC_EnableIRQ(BUTTON_EXTI_IRQn);
    
    // Configure timer interrupt
    HAL_TIM_Base_Start_IT(&htim2);
}

// Button interrupt handler
void HAL_GPIO_EXTI_Callback(uint16_t GPIO_Pin) {
    if (GPIO_Pin == BUTTON_Pin) {
        // Handle button press
        ToggleOperatingMode();
    }
}

// Timer interrupt handler
void HAL_TIM_PeriodElapsedCallback(TIM_HandleTypeDef *htim) {
    if (htim->Instance == TIM2) {
        // Handle timer event
        UpdateSystem();
    }
}
```

### Event Queue

For systems that need to handle multiple events without interrupt conflicts:

```c
typedef struct {
    EventType type;
    uint32_t data;
} SystemEvent;

#define MAX_EVENTS 10
SystemEvent eventQueue[MAX_EVENTS];
volatile uint8_t queueHead = 0;
volatile uint8_t queueTail = 0;

// Add event to queue (can be called from interrupt)
void QueueEvent(EventType type, uint32_t data) {
    uint8_t nextTail = (queueTail + 1) % MAX_EVENTS;
    
    if (nextTail != queueHead) {  // Not full
        eventQueue[queueTail].type = type;
        eventQueue[queueTail].data = data;
        queueTail = nextTail;
    }
}

// Process events in main loop
void ProcessEvents() {
    while (queueHead != queueTail) {
        SystemEvent event = eventQueue[queueHead];
        queueHead = (queueHead + 1) % MAX_EVENTS;
        
        // Handle event based on type
        HandleEvent(event);
    }
}
```

## Debugging Strategies

Plan your debugging approach:

1. **Serial Debug Output**: Configure UART for debug messages
2. **Logic Analyzer**: Plan test points for external signal monitoring
3. **LED Status Indicators**: Define LED patterns for different states
4. **Debugger Usage**: Set up SWD interface for step-through debugging
5. **Fault Handlers**: Implement handlers for hard faults and errors

**Example Debug UART Function:**

```c
// Configure UART for debugging
void InitDebugUART() {
    // UART configuration (115200 baud, 8N1)
    huart2.Instance = USART2;
    huart2.Init.BaudRate = 115200;
    huart2.Init.WordLength = UART_WORDLENGTH_8B;
    huart2.Init.StopBits = UART_STOPBITS_1;
    huart2.Init.Parity = UART_PARITY_NONE;
    huart2.Init.Mode = UART_MODE_TX;
    HAL_UART_Init(&huart2);
}

// Send debug message
void DebugPrint(const char* message) {
    HAL_UART_Transmit(&huart2, (uint8_t*)message, strlen(message), 100);
}
```

## Summary
