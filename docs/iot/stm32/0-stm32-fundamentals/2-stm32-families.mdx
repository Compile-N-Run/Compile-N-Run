# STM32 Families

## Introduction

STM32 microcontrollers, developed by STMicroelectronics, have become one of the most popular choices for embedded systems developers worldwide. Based on ARM Cortex-M cores, these powerful and versatile microcontrollers are organized into distinct families, each tailored for specific application needs.

In this guide, we'll explore the various STM32 families, understand their unique characteristics, and learn how to select the right STM32 microcontroller for your embedded project.

## STM32 Naming Convention

Before diving into the different families, let's understand how STM32 microcontrollers are named:

```
STM32F407VGT6
│    │ │ │ │ │
│    │ │ │ │ └─ Package type (e.g., T = LQFP)
│    │ │ │ └─── Temperature range (6 = -40°C to 85°C)
│    │ │ └───── Memory size (G = 1024KB Flash)
│    │ └─────── Pin count (V = 100 pins)
│    └───────── Subfamily (4 = Performance line)
└────────────── Family (F = mainstream)
```

This naming convention helps identify various aspects of the microcontroller at a glance.
