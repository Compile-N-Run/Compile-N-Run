6. Generate code by clicking the "Generate Code" button

The tool will create initialization code like this:

```c
/* Configure GPIO pin Output Level */
HAL_GPIO_WritePin(GPIOA, GPIO_PIN_5, GPIO_PIN_RESET);

/* Configure GPIO pin : PA5 */
GPIO_InitStruct.Pin = GPIO_PIN_5;
GPIO_InitStruct.Mode = GPIO_MODE_OUTPUT_PP;
GPIO_InitStruct.Pull = GPIO_NOPULL;
GPIO_InitStruct.Speed = GPIO_SPEED_FREQ_LOW;

### 6. Firmware Libraries

#### STM32Cube Libraries

STM32Cube includes a comprehensive set of libraries to simplify development:

- **Low-Layer (LL) API**: Lightweight alternative to HAL with direct register access
- **Middleware components**: USB, TCP/IP, file systems, and more

**Example: Blinking an LED Using HAL Library**

```c
#include "main.h"

int main(void)
{
  /* Reset of all peripherals, initializes the Flash interface and the Systick */
  HAL_Init();

  /* Configure the system clock */
  SystemClock_Config();

  /* Initialize GPIO for LED */
  GPIO_InitTypeDef GPIO_InitStruct = {0};
  __HAL_RCC_GPIOA_CLK_ENABLE();
  GPIO_InitStruct.Pin = GPIO_PIN_5;
  GPIO_InitStruct.Mode = GPIO_MODE_OUTPUT_PP;
  GPIO_InitStruct.Pull = GPIO_NOPULL;
  GPIO_InitStruct.Speed = GPIO_SPEED_FREQ_LOW;
  HAL_GPIO_Init(GPIOA, &GPIO_InitStruct);

  /* Infinite loop */
  while (1)
  {
    HAL_GPIO_TogglePin(GPIOA, GPIO_PIN_5);  // Toggle LED
    HAL_Delay(500);                         // Delay 500ms
  }
}
```

#### STM32 Standard Peripheral Library (Legacy)

This is an older library that's being phased out in favor of the STM32Cube HAL, but you might encounter it in existing projects.

**Example: Blinking an LED Using Standard Peripheral Library**

```c
#include "stm32f4xx.h"
#include "stm32f4xx_gpio.h"
#include "stm32f4xx_rcc.h"

int main(void)
{
  /* Enable clock for GPIOA */
  RCC_AHB1PeriphClockCmd(RCC_AHB1Periph_GPIOA, ENABLE);

  /* Configure PA5 as output */
  GPIO_InitTypeDef GPIO_InitStructure;
  GPIO_InitStructure.GPIO_Pin = GPIO_Pin_5;
  GPIO_InitStructure.GPIO_Mode = GPIO_Mode_OUT;
  GPIO_InitStructure.GPIO_Speed = GPIO_Speed_50MHz;
  GPIO_InitStructure.GPIO_OType = GPIO_OType_PP;
  GPIO_InitStructure.GPIO_PuPd = GPIO_PuPd_NOPULL;
  GPIO_Init(GPIOA, &GPIO_InitStructure);

  while (1)
  {
    GPIO_ToggleBits(GPIOA, GPIO_Pin_5);  // Toggle LED
    
    /* Delay */
    for(volatile uint32_t i = 0; i < 1000000; i++);
  }
}
```

### 7. Development Boards
