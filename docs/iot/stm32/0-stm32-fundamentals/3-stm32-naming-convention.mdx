# STM32 Naming Convention

## Introduction

When first exploring the world of STM32 microcontrollers, you'll quickly notice that they have names like "STM32F103C8T6" or "STM32L476RGT6". These names might seem like random combinations of letters and numbers, but they actually follow a well-defined convention that encodes important information about the device's capabilities, features, and packaging.

Understanding this naming convention is essential when selecting the right microcontroller for your projects, as it helps you quickly identify important characteristics without having to read through lengthy datasheets.

## The STM32 Naming Structure

ST Microelectronics (the manufacturer) uses a systematic approach to name their microcontrollers. Let's break down a typical STM32 name:

```
STM32F103C8T6
│   ││││││││
│   │││││││└─ Package type
│   ││││││└── Temperature range
│   │││││└─── Pin count
│   ││││└──── Flash memory size
│   │││└───── Device variant
│   ││└────── Product line
│   │└─────── STM32 family

## Code Example: Identifying Your STM32 Model

When working with STM32 microcontrollers, you can identify which chip you're using programmatically. Here's a code example showing how to read the device ID and flash size:

```c
#include "stm32f1xx_hal.h"
#include <stdio.h>

void printMCUInfo(void) {
    uint16_t deviceId = (DBGMCU->IDCODE) & DBGMCU_IDCODE_DEV_ID;
    uint16_t revId = (DBGMCU->IDCODE >> 16) & DBGMCU_IDCODE_REV_ID;
    
    printf("Device ID: 0x%04X
", deviceId);
    printf("Revision ID: 0x%04X
", revId);
    
    // Calculate flash size in KB
    uint16_t flashSize = *(__IO uint16_t *)(0x1FFFF7E0);
    printf("Flash size: %d KB
", flashSize);
    
    // Determine STM32 family from device ID
    printf("STM32 Family: ");
    switch(deviceId) {
        case 0x412: printf("STM32F1 Low/Medium density
"); break;
        case 0x410: printf("STM32F1 Medium density
"); break;
        case 0x414: printf("STM32F1 High density
"); break;
        case 0x430: printf("STM32F1 XL density
"); break;
        case 0x418: printf("STM32F1 Connectivity line
"); break;
        case 0x431: printf("STM32F4 device
"); break;
        // Add more families as needed
        default: printf("Unknown
"); break;
    }
}
```

Output example for an STM32F103C8T6:
```
Device ID: 0x0410
Revision ID: 0x1000
Flash size: 64 KB
STM32 Family: STM32F1 Medium density
```

## Summary

The STM32 naming convention may seem complex at first, but it provides a systematic way to understand the capabilities of each microcontroller at a glance. By decoding the model name, you can quickly determine:

- The processor family and its general characteristics
- The specific product line and variant
- The amount of Flash memory
- The pin count and package type
- The temperature range the device is rated for

This knowledge is invaluable when selecting the right microcontroller for your projects or when trying to understand the capabilities of a device you're working with.
