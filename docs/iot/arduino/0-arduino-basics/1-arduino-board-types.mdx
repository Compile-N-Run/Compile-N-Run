# Arduino Board Types

## Introduction

Arduino boards are versatile microcontroller platforms that have revolutionized the world of electronics and programming for hobbyists, students, and professionals alike. These open-source hardware devices allow you to create interactive projects by reading inputs (like sensors or button presses) and controlling outputs (like motors, LEDs, or displays).

In this guide, we'll explore the various Arduino board types available, their specifications, and which board might be best suited for your specific project needs. Whether you're building a simple LED blinker or a complex IoT device, understanding the differences between Arduino boards is essential for success.

## Practical Examples

### 1. Weather Station with Arduino UNO

An Arduino UNO is perfect for a basic weather station project that reads temperature, humidity, and pressure:

```cpp
#include <DHT.h>
#include <Wire.h>
#include <Adafruit_BMP085.h>
#include <LiquidCrystal_I2C.h>

#define DHTPIN 2        // DHT11 data pin
#define DHTTYPE DHT11   // DHT sensor type

DHT dht(DHTPIN, DHTTYPE);
Adafruit_BMP085 bmp;
LiquidCrystal_I2C lcd(0x27, 16, 2);  // Set LCD address to 0x27, 16 chars, 2 lines

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);
  dht.begin();
  bmp.begin();
  lcd.init();
  lcd.backlight();
  
  lcd.setCursor(0, 0);
  lcd.print("Weather Station");
  delay(2000);
}

void loop() {
  // Read humidity and temperature from DHT sensor
  float humidity = dht.readHumidity();
  float tempC = dht.readTemperature();
  
  // Read pressure from BMP sensor
  float pressure = bmp.readPressure() / 100.0F; // Convert Pa to hPa
  
  // Display on LCD
  lcd.clear();
  lcd.setCursor(0, 0);
  lcd.print("Temp: ");
  lcd.print(tempC);
  lcd.print(" C");
  
  lcd.setCursor(0, 1);
  lcd.print("Hum: ");
  lcd.print(humidity);
  lcd.print("% ");
  lcd.print(pressure);
  lcd.print("hPa");
  
  // Send to serial monitor
  Serial.print("Temperature: ");
  Serial.print(tempC);
  Serial.println(" Â°C");
  
  Serial.print("Humidity: ");
  Serial.print(humidity);
  Serial.println(" %");
  
  Serial.print("Pressure: ");
  Serial.print(pressure);
  Serial.println(" hPa");
  
  delay(5000); // Wait 5 seconds between readings
}
```

### 2. IoT Plant Monitor with Arduino MKR WiFi 1010

This example demonstrates using an Arduino MKR WiFi 1010 to monitor soil moisture and upload data to the cloud:

```cpp
#include <WiFiNINA.h>
#include <ThingSpeak.h>

// WiFi credentials
char ssid[] = "YourNetworkName";
char pass[] = "YourNetworkPassword";

// ThingSpeak settings
unsigned long channelID = 1234567;
const char* apiKey = "YOURTHINGSPEAKAPIKEY";

// Pin definitions
const int soilMoisturePin = A0;
const int waterPumpPin = 2;

WiFiClient client;
int status = WL_IDLE_STATUS;

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);
  pinMode(waterPumpPin, OUTPUT);
  digitalWrite(waterPumpPin, LOW);
  
  // Connect to WiFi
  while (status != WL_CONNECTED) {
    Serial.print("Attempting to connect to network: ");
    Serial.println(ssid);
    status = WiFi.begin(ssid, pass);
    delay(10000);
  }
  
  Serial.println("Connected to WiFi");
  ThingSpeak.begin(client);
}

void loop() {
  // Read soil moisture level (higher value = drier soil)
  int moistureLevel = analogRead(soilMoisturePin);
  
  // Convert to percentage (this requires calibration for your specific sensor)
  int moisturePercent = map(moistureLevel, 0, 1023, 100, 0);
  
  Serial.print("Soil Moisture: ");
  Serial.print(moisturePercent);
  Serial.println("%");
  
  // Water the plant if soil is too dry
  if (moisturePercent < 30) {
    Serial.println("Soil too dry - watering plant!");
    digitalWrite(waterPumpPin, HIGH);
    delay(3000);
    digitalWrite(waterPumpPin, LOW);
  }
  
  // Upload data to ThingSpeak
  ThingSpeak.setField(1, moisturePercent);
  int httpCode = ThingSpeak.writeFields(channelID, apiKey);
  
  if (httpCode == 200) {
    Serial.println("Data sent to ThingSpeak successfully");
  } else {
    Serial.print("Problem uploading to ThingSpeak. HTTP error code: ");
    Serial.println(httpCode);
  }
  
  // Wait 15 minutes before next reading
  delay(900000);
}
```

## Choosing the Right Arduino Board

When selecting an Arduino board for your project, consider these factors:

1. **Number of I/O pins needed**: Count how many sensors, buttons, LEDs, and other components you'll connect
2. **Memory requirements**: More complex code requires more flash memory
3. **Size constraints**: Some projects require smaller boards
4. **Power consumption**: Battery-powered projects benefit from low-power boards
5. **Special features needed**: WiFi, Bluetooth, USB functionality, etc.
6. **Budget**: Prices vary significantly between models

## Common Arduino Shields and Add-ons

Arduino's functionality can be extended with shields (add-on boards):

- **Ethernet Shield**: Adds internet connectivity to your Arduino
- **Motor Shield**: Simplifies controlling DC motors, stepper motors, and servos
- **LCD Shield**: Makes it easy to add a display to your project
- **Sensor Shields**: Add multiple sensors easily
- **Relay Shields**: Control high-voltage devices

## Summary

Arduino offers a diverse ecosystem of boards to suit virtually any electronic project. For beginners, the UNO remains the ideal starting point due to its extensive documentation and community support. As your projects grow in complexity, you might migrate to more specialized boards like the Mega 2560 for pin-intensive projects or the MKR series for IoT applications.

Remember that most Arduino code is compatible across different board types with minimal adjustments, allowing you to start simple and scale up as needed.

## Exercises

1. **Board Selection Exercise**: For each of the following project ideas, identify which Arduino board would be most suitable and explain why:
   - A simple LED cube with 27 LEDs (3x3x3)
   - A weather station that uploads data to the internet
   - A wearable fitness tracker
   - A home automation system controlling 20+ devices

2. **Comparative Analysis**: Create a table comparing the specifications of three Arduino boards of your choice.

3. **Hands-on Project**: If you have an Arduino UNO, try implementing the basic weather station example and modify it to include additional features.
