# MySQL Disable Events

## Introduction

MySQL Events operate similar to cron jobs in Unix systems, automatically executing SQL statements at scheduled intervals. However, there are situations when you might want to temporarily or permanently disable these events. For instance, during system maintenance, when migrating data, or when troubleshooting performance issues.

In this tutorial, you'll learn:
- How to disable individual MySQL events
- How to disable the entire event scheduler
- How to check event status
- Common use cases for disabling events
- Troubleshooting disabled events

## Understanding MySQL Event States

Before we dive into disabling events, it's important to understand the different states an event can have in MySQL:

1. **ENABLED** - The event is active and will execute at its scheduled time
2. **DISABLED** - The event exists but will not execute until re-enabled
3. **SLAVESIDE_DISABLED** - The event is disabled on slave servers in a replication setup

## Checking the Event Scheduler Status

First, let's check if the event scheduler is currently running:

```sql
SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'event_scheduler';
```

Output:
```
+----------------+-------+
| Variable_name  | Value |
+----------------+-------+
| event_scheduler | ON    |
+----------------+-------+
```

You can also check the status using this alternative method:

```sql
SELECT @@event_scheduler;
```

Output:
```
+------------------+
| @@event_scheduler |
+------------------+
| ON               |
+------------------+
```

## Disabling Individual Events

### Method 1: Using ALTER EVENT

To disable a single event without removing it from the database, use the `ALTER EVENT` statement with the `DISABLE` clause:

```sql
ALTER EVENT event_name DISABLE;
```

For example, if you have an event named `update_stats` that you want to disable:

```sql
ALTER EVENT update_stats DISABLE;
```

Output:
```
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.03 sec)
```

### Method 2: Disabling During Event Creation

You can also specify that an event should be created in a disabled state:

```sql
CREATE EVENT my_new_event
ON SCHEDULE AT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP + INTERVAL 1 HOUR
DO
    UPDATE products SET price = price * 1.1
DISABLE;  -- This creates the event in disabled state
```

## Disabling the Entire Event Scheduler

If you want to disable all events at once, you can turn off the entire event scheduler. This is useful during system maintenance or when you're experiencing server performance issues.

### Method 1: Using SET GLOBAL

```sql
SET GLOBAL event_scheduler = OFF;
```

Output:
```
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)
```

### Method 2: Using my.cnf Configuration File

For a permanent change across server restarts, edit your MySQL configuration file (`my.cnf` or `my.ini`):

```
[mysqld]
event_scheduler = OFF
```

After making this change, you'll need to restart your MySQL server for the changes to take effect.

### Method 3: Command Line Option

You can also disable the event scheduler when starting the MySQL server:

```bash
mysqld --event-scheduler=OFF
```

## Checking Event Status

To view all events and their current status:

```sql
SELECT event_name, status, event_definition 
FROM information_schema.events;
```

Output:
```
+---------------+----------+------------------------------------------------+
| event_name    | status   | event_definition                               |
+---------------+----------+------------------------------------------------+
| update_stats  | DISABLED | BEGIN UPDATE stats SET last_update = NOW(); END |
| clean_logs    | ENABLED  | BEGIN DELETE FROM logs WHERE date < NOW() - ... |
+---------------+----------+------------------------------------------------+
```

## Re-enabling Events

### Re-enabling Individual Events

To re-enable a previously disabled event:

```sql
ALTER EVENT event_name ENABLE;
```

Example:

```sql
ALTER EVENT update_stats ENABLE;
```

Output:
```
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.02 sec)
```

### Re-enabling the Event Scheduler

To turn the event scheduler back on:

```sql
SET GLOBAL event_scheduler = ON;
```

Output:
```
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)
```

## Real-World Use Cases

### Case 1: System Maintenance

Before performing system maintenance, it's often advisable to disable events to prevent them from executing during critical operations:

```sql
-- Disable the event scheduler before maintenance
SET GLOBAL event_scheduler = OFF;

-- Perform maintenance tasks...
-- For example: ALTER TABLE large_table ADD COLUMN new_col INT;

-- Re-enable the event scheduler after maintenance
SET GLOBAL event_scheduler = ON;
```

### Case 2: Selective Event Disabling

You might want to disable specific resource-intensive events during peak hours:

```sql
-- Create an event that disables resource-intensive events during business hours
DELIMITER //
CREATE EVENT manage_resource_events
ON SCHEDULE EVERY 1 DAY
STARTS CURRENT_DATE + INTERVAL 8 HOUR
DO
BEGIN
    -- Disable resource-intensive events during business hours
    ALTER EVENT data_aggregation DISABLE;
    
    -- Schedule another event to re-enable them after hours
    CREATE EVENT IF NOT EXISTS enable_heavy_events
    ON SCHEDULE AT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP + INTERVAL 10 HOUR
    DO
        ALTER EVENT data_aggregation ENABLE;
END //
DELIMITER ;
```

### Case 3: Debugging Event Issues

When troubleshooting event-related problems, temporarily disabling events can help isolate issues:

```sql
-- Disable all events for troubleshooting
SET GLOBAL event_scheduler = OFF;

-- Re-enable events one by one to identify problematic one
SET GLOBAL event_scheduler = ON;
ALTER EVENT event1 ENABLE;
-- Test if issue occurs
ALTER EVENT event2 ENABLE;
-- Test if issue occurs
-- And so on...
```

## Common Issues and Troubleshooting

### Issue 1: Events Not Enabling After Scheduler Restart

Sometimes events may remain disabled even after enabling the scheduler. Check their individual status:

```sql
SELECT event_name, status FROM information_schema.events 
WHERE status = 'DISABLED';
```

You'll need to enable each disabled event individually:

```sql
ALTER EVENT event_name ENABLE;
```

### Issue 2: Insufficient Privileges

You might encounter permission issues when trying to disable events:

```
ERROR 1227 (42000): Access denied; you need (at least one of) the SUPER or EVENT privilege(s) for this operation
```

Solution: Make sure you have the appropriate privileges:

```sql
GRANT EVENT ON *.* TO 'your_user'@'localhost';
```

### Issue 3: Events on Replicas

In a primary-replica (master-slave) setup, events on the replica might cause data inconsistency. It's common practice to disable events on replicas:

```sql
-- On replica servers, disable the event scheduler
SET GLOBAL event_scheduler = OFF;
```

## Summary

### Exercises

1. Create an event that automatically disables itself after running 5 times.
2. Write a script that checks if any critical events are disabled and sends an alert if they are.
