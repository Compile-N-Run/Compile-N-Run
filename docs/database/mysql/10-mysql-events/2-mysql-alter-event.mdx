# MySQL ALTER EVENT

## Introduction

In MySQL, events are scheduled tasks that execute automatically at specified times. Once you've created an event, you might need to modify its properties, such as its execution schedule, the SQL statements it runs, or whether it's enabled or disabled. This is where the `ALTER EVENT` statement comes in handy.

The `ALTER EVENT` statement allows you to modify existing events without having to drop and recreate them. This can be particularly useful in production environments where you might need to adjust event scheduling or modify event logic with minimal disruption.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into altering events, make sure you:

1. Have appropriate privileges (`EVENT` privilege)
2. Understand basic event concepts
3. Have the event scheduler enabled on your MySQL server

## Basic Syntax

The basic syntax for `ALTER EVENT` is:

```sql
ALTER EVENT event_name
    [ON SCHEDULE schedule]
    [ON COMPLETION [NOT] PRESERVE]
    [RENAME TO new_event_name]
    [ENABLE | DISABLE | DISABLE ON SLAVE]
    [COMMENT 'string']
    [DO event_body]
```

Let's break down these clauses:

- `event_name`: The name of the existing event you want to modify
- `ON SCHEDULE`: Allows you to change the timing details for the event
- `ON COMPLETION`: Determines if the event is dropped after completing execution
- `RENAME TO`: Changes the name of the event
- `ENABLE | DISABLE | DISABLE ON SLAVE`: Controls whether the event is active
- `COMMENT`: A comment or description for the event
- `DO`: The SQL statement or statements that the event will execute

## Common ALTER EVENT Use Cases

### 1. Changing the Schedule of an Event

One of the most frequent modifications is changing when an event runs:

```sql
ALTER EVENT yearly_cleanup
  ON SCHEDULE EVERY 6 MONTH
  STARTS '2023-01-01 00:00:00';
```

This changes the `yearly_cleanup` event to run every 6 months instead of yearly, starting from January 1, 2023.

### 2. Enabling or Disabling an Event

To temporarily disable an event without deleting it:

```sql
ALTER EVENT daily_data_archive
  DISABLE;
```

To re-enable it later:

```sql
ALTER EVENT daily_data_archive
  ENABLE;
```

### 3. Modifying the Event Body

If you need to change what the event actually does:

```sql
ALTER EVENT user_stats_update
  DO
    BEGIN
      UPDATE user_statistics
      SET login_count = (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM login_history WHERE user_id = user_statistics.user_id),
          last_activity = (SELECT MAX(login_time) FROM login_history WHERE user_id = user_statistics.user_id);
      
      -- Added new metric tracking
      UPDATE user_statistics
      SET engagement_score = (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM user_actions WHERE user_id = user_statistics.user_id);
    END;
```

### 4. Renaming an Event

To change the name of an existing event:

```sql
ALTER EVENT old_event_name
  RENAME TO new_event_name;
```

### 5. Changing Multiple Properties at Once

You can combine multiple modifications in a single statement:

```sql
ALTER EVENT data_aggregation
  ON SCHEDULE EVERY 1 DAY
  STARTS CURRENT_TIMESTAMP + INTERVAL 1 HOUR
  COMMENT 'Daily data aggregation job - updated with new metrics'
  DO
    BEGIN
      DELETE FROM daily_metrics WHERE created_date < DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 90 DAY);
      INSERT INTO daily_metrics (metric_date, total_users, active_users, conversion_rate)
        SELECT 
          CURDATE(),
          COUNT(*),
          COUNT(IF(last_login > DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 7 DAY), 1, NULL)),
          AVG(purchased / NULLIF(visited, 0)) * 100
        FROM user_activity;
    END;
```

## Real-World Applications

### Example 1: Adjusting Maintenance Window

Imagine you have a database maintenance event that runs during off-hours, but your business has changed its operating hours:

```sql
ALTER EVENT database_maintenance
  ON SCHEDULE EVERY 1 WEEK
  STARTS '2023-06-01 02:00:00' -- Changed from midnight to 2 AM
  COMMENT 'Weekly maintenance now runs at 2 AM to avoid interference with nightly batch processes'
  ENABLE;
```

### Example 2: Seasonal Sales Reporting

For a retail business, you might need to adjust reporting frequency during holiday seasons:

```sql
ALTER EVENT sales_reporting
  ON SCHEDULE EVERY 6 HOUR -- Changed from daily to every 6 hours
  STARTS CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
  ENDS '2024-01-15 00:00:00' -- Will run more frequently until post-holiday period
  DO
    BEGIN
      INSERT INTO sales_summaries (report_time, total_sales, top_category)
      SELECT 
        NOW(),
        SUM(amount),
        (SELECT category FROM sales WHERE created_at > DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 6 HOUR)
         GROUP BY category ORDER BY SUM(amount) DESC LIMIT 1)
      FROM sales
      WHERE created_at > DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 6 HOUR);
    END;
```

After the holiday season, you can revert to the normal schedule:

```sql
ALTER EVENT sales_reporting
  ON SCHEDULE EVERY 1 DAY
  STARTS '2024-01-16 00:00:00'
  ENDS NULL;
```

### Example 3: Dynamic Database Partitioning

Adapting a partitioning maintenance event as your data volume grows:

```sql
ALTER EVENT manage_partitions
  ON SCHEDULE EVERY 1 DAY
  DO
    BEGIN
      -- Previous logic only maintained 30 days of partitions
      -- New logic maintains 90 days and pre-creates partitions further in advance
      
      CALL create_future_partitions('transactions', 30); -- Create partitions 30 days in advance
      CALL drop_old_partitions('transactions', 90); -- Keep 90 days of history
    END;
```

## Best Practices

1. **Always verify event changes**:
   ```sql
   SHOW EVENTS LIKE 'event_name';
   ```

2. **Document event modifications**: Use the `COMMENT` clause to keep track of when and why an event was modified:
   ```sql
   ALTER EVENT cleanup_logs
     COMMENT 'Modified on 2023-05-15 to include new log tables. Owner: Database Team';
   ```

3. **Test before applying to production**: Test your altered event in a development environment first.

4. **Consider using variables for dynamic event bodies**: Makes events more flexible and easier to maintain.

5. **Implement error handling**: Capture errors that might occur during event execution.

## Troubleshooting ALTER EVENT

### Event Not Running After Alteration

If your event doesn't run after altering it:

1. Check if the event scheduler is enabled:
   ```sql
   SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'event_scheduler';
   ```

2. Verify the event status:
   ```sql
   SHOW EVENTS WHERE Name = 'your_event_name';
   ```

3. Check for syntax errors in your event body.

### Permission Errors

If you encounter permission errors:

```sql
-- Grant appropriate privileges
GRANT EVENT ON *.* TO 'username'@'hostname';

-- For altering specific events in a database
GRANT EVENT ON database_name.* TO 'username'@'hostname';
```

## Advanced ALTER EVENT Features

### Conditional Event Execution

You can modify an event to include conditional logic:

```sql
ALTER EVENT conditional_backup
  DO
    BEGIN
      DECLARE table_count INT;
      
      SELECT COUNT(*) INTO table_count 
      FROM information_schema.tables 
      WHERE table_schema = 'my_database';
      
      IF table_count > 100 THEN
        -- Run more comprehensive backup for large databases
        CALL run_comprehensive_backup();
      ELSE
        -- Run standard backup
        CALL run_standard_backup();
      END IF;
    END;
```

### Altering Event Preservation

Control what happens after the event completes its schedule:

```sql
ALTER EVENT one_time_migration
  ON COMPLETION NOT PRESERVE; -- Event will be dropped after execution
```

Or to keep the event after completion:

```sql
ALTER EVENT yearly_summary
  ON COMPLETION PRESERVE; -- Event will be kept after execution
```

## Summary

The `ALTER EVENT` statement is a powerful tool for managing MySQL scheduled events. It allows you to:

- Change event schedules
- Enable or disable events
- Modify the SQL being executed
- Rename events
- Update event metadata

These capabilities make event management flexible and adaptable to changing business requirements without needing to drop and recreate your scheduled tasks.

## Additional Resources and Exercises

### Exercises

1. Create a simple event that inserts the current timestamp into a log table every hour, then use `ALTER EVENT` to change it to run every 30 minutes.

2. Create an event that removes old data, then alter it to add logging of how many records were removed.

3. Write an event that runs weekly, then alter it to run on specific days of the week (Monday, Wednesday, Friday).
