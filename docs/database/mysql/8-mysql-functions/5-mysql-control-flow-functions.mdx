# MySQL Control Flow Functions

Control flow functions in MySQL allow you to add conditional logic to your database queries. They work similarly to control flow statements in programming languages, enabling you to make decisions within your SQL statements based on certain conditions.

## Introduction

Control flow functions are powerful tools that let you implement decision-making directly in your SQL queries. Instead of writing complex application code to handle different data scenarios, you can use these functions to simplify your queries and handle various conditions efficiently at the database level.

In this tutorial, we'll explore the most commonly used MySQL control flow functions:

- `IF()`: Evaluates a condition and returns a value based on whether it's true or false
- `CASE`: Provides more complex conditional logic with multiple conditions
- `IFNULL()`: Returns an alternative value if an expression is NULL
- `NULLIF()`: Compares two expressions and returns NULL if they are equal
- `COALESCE()`: Returns the first non-NULL value from a list of expressions

Let's dive into each function with examples and practical applications.

## The IF() Function

The `IF()` function works like a simplified version of the if-else statement found in programming languages. It takes three arguments:

```sql
IF(condition, value_if_true, value_if_false)
```

### Basic Example

```sql
SELECT IF(10 > 5, 'Yes', 'No') AS result;
```

Output:
```
+--------+
| result |
+--------+
| Yes    |
+--------+
```

Since 10 is indeed greater than 5, the function returns 'Yes'.

### Practical Example: Order Status

Let's say you have an orders table and want to categorize orders based on their total value:

```sql
SELECT 
    order_id, 
    total_amount,
    IF(total_amount > 1000, 'High Value', 'Standard') AS order_category
FROM 
    orders;
```

Output:
```
+----------+--------------+----------------+
| order_id | total_amount | order_category |
+----------+--------------+----------------+
|    10308 |       88.80  | Standard       |
|    10309 |     1250.00  | High Value     |
|    10310 |      336.00  | Standard       |
|    10311 |     1520.00  | High Value     |
+----------+--------------+----------------+
```

## The CASE Expression

The `CASE` expression is more flexible than the `IF()` function as it allows multiple conditions. MySQL supports two types of CASE expressions:

### 1. Simple CASE

```sql
CASE expression
    WHEN value1 THEN result1
    WHEN value2 THEN result2
    ...
    [ELSE default_result]
END
```

### 2. Searched CASE

```sql
CASE
    WHEN condition1 THEN result1
    WHEN condition2 THEN result2
    ...
    [ELSE default_result]
END
```

### Basic Example: Simple CASE

```sql
SELECT 
    product_name,
    CASE category_id
        WHEN 1 THEN 'Electronics'
        WHEN 2 THEN 'Clothing'
        WHEN 3 THEN 'Food'
        ELSE 'Other'
    END AS category_name
FROM 
    products;
```

Output:
```
+----------------+---------------+
| product_name   | category_name |
+----------------+---------------+
| Laptop         | Electronics   |
| T-shirt        | Clothing      |
| Chocolate      | Food          |
| Notebook       | Other         |
+----------------+---------------+
```

### Basic Example: Searched CASE

```sql
SELECT 
    student_name,
    score,
    CASE 
        WHEN score >= 90 THEN 'A'
        WHEN score >= 80 THEN 'B'
        WHEN score >= 70 THEN 'C'
        WHEN score >= 60 THEN 'D'
        ELSE 'F'
    END AS grade
FROM 
    students;
```

Output:
```
+--------------+-------+-------+
| student_name | score | grade |
+--------------+-------+-------+
| Alice        |    95 | A     |
| Bob          |    82 | B     |
| Charlie      |    76 | C     |
| Diana        |    63 | D     |
| Evan         |    55 | F     |
+--------------+-------+-------+
```

### Practical Example: Customer Segmentation

```sql
SELECT 
    customer_id,
    customer_name,
    total_purchases,
    CASE 
        WHEN total_purchases > 10000 THEN 'Platinum'
        WHEN total_purchases > 5000 THEN 'Gold'
        WHEN total_purchases > 1000 THEN 'Silver'
        ELSE 'Bronze'
    END AS customer_tier
FROM 
    customers;
```

Output:
```
+-------------+---------------+-----------------+--------------+
| customer_id | customer_name | total_purchases | customer_tier|
+-------------+---------------+-----------------+--------------+
|        1001 | John Smith    |          12500  | Platinum     |
|        1002 | Jane Doe      |           4500  | Bronze       |
|        1003 | David Johnson |           7800  | Gold         |
|        1004 | Sarah Wilson  |           2300  | Silver       |
+-------------+---------------+-----------------+--------------+
```

## The IFNULL() Function

The `IFNULL()` function returns a specified value if the expression is NULL, otherwise it returns the expression itself.

```sql
IFNULL(expression, replacement_value)
```

### Basic Example

```sql
SELECT IFNULL(NULL, 'It was NULL') AS result;
```

Output:
```
+-------------+
| result      |
+-------------+
| It was NULL |
+-------------+
```

```sql
SELECT IFNULL('Not NULL', 'It was NULL') AS result;
```

Output:
```
+----------+
| result   |
+----------+
| Not NULL |
+----------+
```

### Practical Example: Handling Missing Phone Numbers

```sql
SELECT 
    customer_name,
    IFNULL(phone_number, 'No phone provided') AS contact_number
FROM 
    customers;
```

Output:
```
+---------------+------------------+
| customer_name | contact_number   |
+---------------+------------------+
| John Smith    | +1-555-123-4567  |
| Jane Doe      | No phone provided|
| Alice Johnson | +1-555-987-6543  |
+---------------+------------------+
```

## The NULLIF() Function

The `NULLIF()` function compares two expressions and returns NULL if they are equal, otherwise it returns the first expression.

```sql
NULLIF(expression1, expression2)
```

### Basic Example

```sql
SELECT NULLIF(10, 10) AS result;
```

Output:
```
+--------+
| result |
+--------+
| NULL   |
+--------+
```

```sql
SELECT NULLIF(10, 20) AS result;
```

Output:
```
+--------+
| result |
+--------+
| 10     |
+--------+
```

### Practical Example: Avoiding Division by Zero

One common use of `NULLIF()` is to prevent division by zero errors:

```sql
SELECT
    product_name,
    items_sold,
    items_returned,
    items_sold / NULLIF(items_returned, 0) AS return_ratio
FROM
    product_performance;
```

Output:
```
+--------------+------------+----------------+-------------+
| product_name | items_sold | items_returned | return_ratio|
+--------------+------------+----------------+-------------+
| Laptop       |       100  |             10 |       10.00 |
| Smartphone   |        80  |              0 |        NULL |
| Tablet       |        50  |              5 |       10.00 |
+--------------+------------+----------------+-------------+
```

In this example, without `NULLIF()`, the second row would cause a division by zero error. By using `NULLIF()`, we get NULL instead.

## The COALESCE() Function

The `COALESCE()` function returns the first non-NULL value in a list of expressions.

```sql
COALESCE(value1, value2, ..., valueN)
```

### Basic Example

```sql
SELECT COALESCE(NULL, NULL, 'First non-NULL', NULL, 'Another value') AS result;
```

Output:
```
+----------------+
| result         |
+----------------+
| First non-NULL |
+----------------+
```

### Practical Example: Contact Preference

This function is useful when you want to find the first available contact method for a customer:

```sql
SELECT 
    customer_name,
    COALESCE(mobile_phone, home_phone, email, 'No contact information') AS preferred_contact
FROM 
    customers;
```

Output:
```
+---------------+----------------------+
| customer_name | preferred_contact    |
+---------------+----------------------+
| John Smith    | +1-555-123-4567      |
| Jane Doe      | jane.doe@example.com |
| David Johnson | +1-555-987-6543      |
| Sarah Wilson  | No contact information|
+---------------+----------------------+
```

In this example, the query checks for a mobile phone first, then home phone, then email, and if all are NULL, it returns 'No contact information'.

## Combining Control Flow Functions

You can combine multiple control flow functions to create more complex logic:

```sql
SELECT
    order_id,
    order_date,
    CASE
        WHEN DATEDIFF(CURRENT_DATE, order_date) <= 1 THEN 'New order'
        WHEN status = 'Shipped' THEN 'In transit'
        WHEN IFNULL(tracking_number, '') = '' THEN 'Processed, awaiting shipment'
        ELSE 'Unknown status'
    END AS order_status
FROM
    orders;
```

Output:
```
+----------+------------+--------------------------+
| order_id | order_date | order_status             |
+----------+------------+--------------------------+
|    10308 | 2023-05-31 | In transit               |
|    10309 | 2023-06-01 | New order                |
|    10310 | 2023-05-28 | Processed, awaiting shipment|
|    10311 | 2023-05-29 | In transit               |
+----------+------------+--------------------------+
```

## Real-World Application: Customer Reporting

Let's create a comprehensive customer reporting query that uses multiple control flow functions:

```sql
SELECT
    c.customer_id,
    c.customer_name,
    COALESCE(c.company_name, 'Individual') AS organization,
    COUNT(o.order_id) AS total_orders,
    SUM(o.total_amount) AS total_spent,
    AVG(o.total_amount) AS avg_order_value,
    CASE
        WHEN COUNT(o.order_id) = 0 THEN 'No purchases'
        WHEN COUNT(o.order_id) > 10 OR SUM(o.total_amount) > 10000 THEN 'VIP'
        WHEN COUNT(o.order_id) > 5 OR SUM(o.total_amount) > 5000 THEN 'Premium'
        ELSE 'Regular'
    END AS customer_status,
    IFNULL(
        DATE_FORMAT(MAX(o.order_date), '%Y-%m-%d'),
        'Never ordered'
    ) AS last_order_date,
    NULLIF(
        DATEDIFF(CURRENT_DATE, MAX(o.order_date)),
        DATEDIFF(CURRENT_DATE, CURRENT_DATE)
    ) AS days_since_last_order
FROM
    customers c
LEFT JOIN
    orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
GROUP BY
    c.customer_id, c.customer_name, c.company_name;
```

This query provides a comprehensive view of customer behavior by:
- Using `COALESCE()` to handle missing company names
- Using `CASE` to categorize customers based on their order history
- Using `IFNULL()` to handle customers who never placed an order
- Using `NULLIF()` to prevent showing 0 days for customers who ordered today

## Summary

MySQL control flow functions allow you to add conditional logic directly in your SQL queries. We've covered:

- `IF()`: Simple conditional expressions
- `CASE`: More complex conditional logic
- `IFNULL()`: Handling NULL values with defaults
- `NULLIF()`: Returning NULL for specific value matches
- `COALESCE()`: Finding the first non-NULL value

These functions are essential tools that help you write more efficient queries and reduce the need for complex application-level logic. By handling conditional scenarios at the database level, you can simplify your application code and improve overall performance.

## Exercises

To practice what you've learned, try these exercises:

1. Write a query that categorizes products by price ranges (Budget, Mid-range, Premium) using the `CASE` expression.
2. Use `IFNULL()` to display "Anonymous" for any blog posts where the author name is NULL.
3. Create a query that uses `COALESCE()` to determine which shipping address to use (try using priority order: shipping_address, billing_address, company_address, 'Address not provided').
4. Combine `CASE` and `IFNULL()` to create a discount category based on customer loyalty where NULL loyalty points are treated as 0.
