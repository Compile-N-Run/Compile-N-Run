# MySQL Numeric Functions

## Introduction

Numeric functions in MySQL are essential tools for performing mathematical operations and transformations on numeric data. Whether you're calculating sales figures, analyzing metrics, or processing scientific data, these functions allow you to manipulate numbers efficiently within your database queries.

In this guide, we'll explore the various numeric functions available in MySQL, understand their syntax, and see how they can be applied in practical scenarios. These functions range from basic arithmetic operations to more complex mathematical calculations, and they're designed to work seamlessly within your SQL queries.

## Basic Arithmetic Functions

MySQL provides several functions for basic mathematical operations beyond the standard arithmetic operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`).

### ABS() - Absolute Value

The `ABS()` function returns the absolute (positive) value of a number.

```sql
SELECT ABS(-15.7), ABS(15.7), ABS(0);
```

Output:
```
15.7, 15.7, 0
```

### ROUND() - Rounding Numbers

The `ROUND()` function rounds a number to a specified number of decimal places.

Syntax: `ROUND(number, decimal_places)`

```sql
SELECT ROUND(123.4567, 2), ROUND(123.4567, 0), ROUND(123.4567, -1);
```

Output:
```
123.46, 123, 120
```

### CEIL() and FLOOR() - Rounding Up and Down

- `CEIL()` rounds a number up to the nearest integer.
- `FLOOR()` rounds a number down to the nearest integer.

```sql
SELECT CEIL(15.1), CEIL(-15.1), FLOOR(15.9), FLOOR(-15.9);
```

Output:
```
16, -15, 15, -16
```

### TRUNCATE() - Truncating Decimal Places

The `TRUNCATE()` function truncates a number to a specified number of decimal places without rounding.

```sql
SELECT TRUNCATE(123.4567, 2), TRUNCATE(123.4567, 0), TRUNCATE(123.4567, -1);
```

Output:
```
123.45, 123, 120
```

## Advanced Mathematical Functions

MySQL offers a variety of advanced mathematical functions for more complex calculations.

### Power and Square Root Functions

- `POW(X, Y)` or `POWER(X, Y)`: Returns X raised to the power of Y.
- `SQRT(X)`: Returns the square root of X.

```sql
SELECT POW(2, 3), POWER(2, 3), SQRT(16);
```

Output:
```
8, 8, 4
```

### Trigonometric Functions

MySQL provides standard trigonometric functions that work with radians:

```sql
SELECT 
    SIN(PI()/4), 
    COS(PI()/4), 
    TAN(PI()/4), 
    COT(PI()/4);
```

Output:
```
0.7071067811865475, 0.7071067811865476, 0.9999999999999999, 1.0000000000000002
```

You can convert between radians and degrees using:

```sql
SELECT 
    RADIANS(90),   -- Convert degrees to radians
    DEGREES(PI()/2); -- Convert radians to degrees
```

Output:
```
1.5707963267948966, 90
```

### Logarithmic Functions

- `LOG(X)`: Natural logarithm of X.
- `LOG10(X)`: Base-10 logarithm of X.
- `LOG2(X)`: Base-2 logarithm of X.
- `LOG(B, X)`: Logarithm of X to the base B.

```sql
SELECT LOG(10), LOG10(100), LOG2(8), LOG(2, 8);
```

Output:
```
2.302585092994046, 2, 3, 3
```

## Random Number Generation

The `RAND()` function generates a random floating-point value between 0 and 1. You can use this for various purposes like sampling data or generating test values.

```sql
SELECT RAND(), RAND(), FLOOR(RAND() * 10);
```

Output (will vary with each execution):
```
0.123456789, 0.987654321, 7
```

To generate random integers in a specific range (e.g., 1 to 100):

```sql
SELECT FLOOR(1 + RAND() * 100);
```

## Practical Examples

Let's explore some real-world applications of MySQL numeric functions.

### Example 1: Calculating Discounted Prices

```sql
CREATE TABLE products (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    price DECIMAL(10, 2)
);

INSERT INTO products VALUES
(1, 'Laptop', 1299.99),
(2, 'Smartphone', 699.50),
(3, 'Headphones', 149.99);

-- Calculate prices with 15% discount and round to 2 decimal places
SELECT 
    name, 
    price AS original_price,
    ROUND(price * 0.85, 2) AS discounted_price,
    ROUND(price * 0.15, 2) AS savings
FROM products;
```

Output:
```
name       | original_price | discounted_price | savings
-----------+---------------+------------------+--------
Laptop     | 1299.99       | 1104.99          | 195.00
Smartphone | 699.50        | 594.58           | 104.93
Headphones | 149.99        | 127.49           | 22.50
```

### Example 2: Calculating Average and Rounding

```sql
CREATE TABLE student_scores (
    student_id INT,
    math FLOAT,
    science FLOAT,
    literature FLOAT
);

INSERT INTO student_scores VALUES
(1, 85.5, 92.3, 78.2),
(2, 95.7, 89.2, 91.5),
(3, 76.8, 84.5, 88.1);

-- Calculate average scores and round
SELECT 
    student_id,
    math, science, literature,
    ROUND((math + science + literature) / 3, 2) AS average_score,
    CEILING((math + science + literature) / 3) AS ceiling_average,
    FLOOR((math + science + literature) / 3) AS floor_average
FROM student_scores
ORDER BY average_score DESC;
```

Output:
```
student_id | math | science | literature | average_score | ceiling_average | floor_average
-----------+------+---------+------------+---------------+-----------------+--------------
2          | 95.7 | 89.2    | 91.5       | 92.13         | 93              | 92
1          | 85.5 | 92.3    | 78.2       | 85.33         | 86              | 85
3          | 76.8 | 84.5    | 88.1       | 83.13         | 84              | 83
```

### Example 3: Financial Calculations

```sql
CREATE TABLE loans (
    loan_id INT,
    principal DECIMAL(10, 2),
    interest_rate DECIMAL(5, 2),
    years INT
);

INSERT INTO loans VALUES
(1, 10000.00, 5.25, 3),
(2, 25000.00, 4.75, 5),
(3, 5000.00, 6.00, 2);

-- Calculate compound interest: P(1+r)^t
SELECT 
    loan_id,
    principal,
    interest_rate,
    years,
    ROUND(principal * POW(1 + (interest_rate/100), years), 2) AS total_amount,
    ROUND(principal * POW(1 + (interest_rate/100), years) - principal, 2) AS interest_amount
FROM loans;
```

Output:
```
loan_id | principal | interest_rate | years | total_amount | interest_amount
--------+-----------+---------------+-------+--------------+----------------
1       | 10000.00  | 5.25          | 3     | 11667.63     | 1667.63
2       | 25000.00  | 4.75          | 5     | 31487.99     | 6487.99
3       | 5000.00   | 6.00          | 2     | 5618.00      | 618.00
```
