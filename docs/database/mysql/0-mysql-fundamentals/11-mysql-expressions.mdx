# MySQL Expressions

## Introduction

Expressions are fundamental building blocks in MySQL that represent values. They form the core of almost every operation you perform in a database, from simple arithmetic to complex data manipulations. An expression can be a constant, a column reference, a function call, or a combination of these with operators. Understanding expressions is essential for writing effective SQL queries and manipulating data efficiently.

In this guide, we'll explore MySQL expressions in depth, including their types, usage, and practical applications.

## What Are MySQL Expressions?

In MySQL, an expression is any combination of values, operators, and functions that evaluates to a single value. Expressions can be used in various parts of SQL statements, such as in `SELECT` lists, `WHERE` clauses, `ORDER BY` clauses, and more.

Here's a simple example:

```sql
SELECT first_name, last_name, salary * 1.1 AS increased_salary
FROM employees;
```

In this query, `salary * 1.1` is an expression that calculates a 10% increase in salary.

## Types of MySQL Expressions

### 1. Literal Values

Literal values are fixed constants that represent specific data:

```sql
SELECT 'Hello, World!' AS greeting; -- String literal
SELECT 42 AS answer; -- Numeric literal
SELECT TRUE AS is_active; -- Boolean literal
```

Output:
```
+--------------+
| greeting     |
+--------------+
| Hello, World!|
+--------------+

+--------+
| answer |
+--------+
| 42     |
+--------+

+-----------+
| is_active |
+-----------+
| 1         |
+-----------+
```

### 2. Column References

Column references access data stored in table columns:

```sql
SELECT first_name, last_name
FROM employees
WHERE department_id = 10;
```

Here, `first_name`, `last_name`, and `department_id` are column references.

### 3. Arithmetic Expressions

MySQL supports standard arithmetic operations:

- Addition (`+`)
- Subtraction (`-`)
- Multiplication (`*`)
- Division (`/`)
- Modulo (`%`)

```sql
SELECT 
    product_name,
    price,
    quantity,
    price * quantity AS total_value
FROM inventory;
```

Output:
```
+--------------+-------+----------+-------------+
| product_name | price | quantity | total_value |
+--------------+-------+----------+-------------+
| Laptop       | 1200  | 5        | 6000        |
| Mouse        | 25    | 20       | 500         |
| Keyboard     | 45    | 15       | 675         |
+--------------+-------+----------+-------------+
```

### 4. Comparison Expressions

Comparison expressions evaluate to TRUE, FALSE, or NULL:

- Equal (`=`)
- Not equal (`!=` or `<>`)
- Greater than (`>`)
- Less than (`<`)
- Greater than or equal to (`>=`)
- Less than or equal to (`<=`)

```sql
SELECT 
    product_name,
    price,
    CASE 
        WHEN price > 100 THEN 'Expensive'
        WHEN price > 50 THEN 'Moderate'
        ELSE 'Affordable'
    END AS price_category
FROM products;
```

Output:
```
+--------------+-------+----------------+
| product_name | price | price_category |
+--------------+-------+----------------+
| Laptop       | 1200  | Expensive      |
| Mouse        | 25    | Affordable     |
| Keyboard     | 75    | Moderate       |
+--------------+-------+----------------+
```

### 5. Logical Expressions

Logical expressions combine conditions using AND, OR, and NOT operators:

```sql
SELECT 
    product_name,
    stock_quantity,
    price
FROM products
WHERE (price < 50 OR price > 500) AND stock_quantity > 0;
```

This query retrieves products that are either inexpensive (under $50) or premium (over $500) and are in stock.

### 6. Function Calls

MySQL provides numerous built-in functions that can be used in expressions:

```sql
SELECT 
    CONCAT(first_name, ' ', last_name) AS full_name,
    ROUND(salary, 2) AS rounded_salary,
    DATEDIFF(CURRENT_DATE(), hire_date) AS days_employed
FROM employees;
```

Output:
```
+---------------+----------------+---------------+
| full_name     | rounded_salary | days_employed |
+---------------+----------------+---------------+
| John Smith    | 52000.00       | 1095          |
| Sara Johnson  | 63500.00       | 730           |
| Michael Davis | 48750.00       | 365           |
+---------------+----------------+---------------+
```

## Using Expressions in SQL Statements

### In SELECT Clauses

Expressions are commonly used to compute derived values in SELECT statements:

```sql
SELECT 
    order_id,
    quantity * unit_price AS order_value,
    CASE
        WHEN quantity * unit_price > 1000 THEN 'Large Order'
        ELSE 'Small Order'
    END AS order_size
FROM orders;
```

### In WHERE Clauses

Expressions help filter records based on specific conditions:

```sql
SELECT 
    customer_name,
    total_purchases
FROM customers
WHERE total_purchases > (SELECT AVG(total_purchases) FROM customers) * 1.5;
```

This query finds customers whose total purchases exceed the average by 50% or more.

### In ORDER BY Clauses

Expressions can determine the sorting order:

```sql
SELECT 
    product_name,
    units_sold,
    unit_price
FROM sales
ORDER BY units_sold * unit_price DESC;
```

This sorts results by total revenue (units_sold * unit_price) in descending order.

### In GROUP BY Clauses

Although less common, expressions can be used in GROUP BY:

```sql
SELECT 
    YEAR(order_date) AS year,
    MONTH(order_date) AS month,
    SUM(order_value) AS monthly_sales
FROM orders
GROUP BY YEAR(order_date), MONTH(order_date)
ORDER BY year, month;
```

## Advanced Expression Techniques

### Subqueries as Expressions

A subquery can serve as an expression that returns a single value:

```sql
SELECT 
    department_name,
    employee_count,
    (SELECT AVG(employee_count) FROM departments) AS avg_size,
    employee_count - (SELECT AVG(employee_count) FROM departments) AS difference
FROM departments;
```

### Conditional Expressions

The `IF()` function and `CASE` expressions provide conditional logic:

```sql
-- Using IF()
SELECT 
    product_name,
    stock_level,
    IF(stock_level < reorder_level, 'Reorder', 'OK') AS status
FROM inventory;

-- Using CASE
SELECT 
    student_name,
    score,
    CASE 
        WHEN score >= 90 THEN 'A'
        WHEN score >= 80 THEN 'B'
        WHEN score >= 70 THEN 'C'
        WHEN score >= 60 THEN 'D'
        ELSE 'F'
    END AS grade
FROM exam_results;
```

### Working with NULL Values

The `COALESCE()` function is useful for handling NULL values in expressions:

```sql
SELECT 
    product_name,
    COALESCE(discount_percentage, 0) AS discount,
    base_price * (1 - COALESCE(discount_percentage, 0)/100) AS final_price
FROM products;
```

This sets the discount to 0 when `discount_percentage` is NULL.

## Real-World Applications

### Price Calculation in E-Commerce

```sql
SELECT 
    p.product_name,
    p.base_price,
    COALESCE(d.discount_percent, 0) AS discount,
    p.base_price * (1 - COALESCE(d.discount_percent, 0)/100) AS final_price,
    CASE
        WHEN p.base_price * (1 - COALESCE(d.discount_percent, 0)/100) < 50 THEN 'Budget'
        WHEN p.base_price * (1 - COALESCE(d.discount_percent, 0)/100) < 200 THEN 'Mid-range'
        ELSE 'Premium'
    END AS price_category
FROM products p
LEFT JOIN discounts d ON p.product_id = d.product_id;
```

### Employee Performance Analysis

```sql
SELECT 
    e.employee_id,
    CONCAT(e.first_name, ' ', e.last_name) AS employee_name,
    e.base_salary,
    SUM(s.sale_amount) AS total_sales,
    COUNT(s.sale_id) AS sales_count,
    SUM(s.sale_amount) / COUNT(s.sale_id) AS avg_sale_value,
    CASE
        WHEN SUM(s.sale_amount) > 500000 THEN e.base_salary * 0.10
        WHEN SUM(s.sale_amount) > 250000 THEN e.base_salary * 0.05
        ELSE 0
    END AS bonus
FROM employees e
LEFT JOIN sales s ON e.employee_id = s.employee_id
WHERE s.sale_date BETWEEN '2023-01-01' AND '2023-12-31'
GROUP BY e.employee_id, e.first_name, e.last_name, e.base_salary;
```

### Financial Data Analysis

```sql
SELECT 
    account_id,
    opening_balance,
    closing_balance,
    closing_balance - opening_balance AS net_change,
    ((closing_balance - opening_balance) / opening_balance) * 100 AS percent_change,
    CASE
        WHEN closing_balance > opening_balance THEN 'Profit'
        WHEN closing_balance < opening_balance THEN 'Loss'
        ELSE 'Break-even'
    END AS performance
FROM financial_accounts
WHERE period = 'Q4-2023';
```

## Common Pitfalls and Best Practices

### Division by Zero

Be cautious of division operations that could result in division by zero:

```sql
-- Problematic query
SELECT product_name, total_value / units_sold AS price_per_unit
FROM inventory;

-- Safer alternative
SELECT 
    product_name, 
    CASE 
        WHEN units_sold = 0 THEN NULL
        ELSE total_value / units_sold 
    END AS price_per_unit
FROM inventory;
```

### Type Conversion Issues

Be aware of implicit type conversions that might affect your results:

```sql
-- This might not work as expected if zip_code starts with zeros
SELECT * FROM customers WHERE zip_code = 02115;

-- Better approach
SELECT * FROM customers WHERE zip_code = '02115';
```

### Performance Considerations

Complex expressions in `WHERE` clauses may prevent the use of indexes:

```sql
-- May not use index on order_date
SELECT * FROM orders WHERE YEAR(order_date) = 2023;

-- Better for performance
SELECT * FROM orders WHERE order_date BETWEEN '2023-01-01' AND '2023-12-31';
```
