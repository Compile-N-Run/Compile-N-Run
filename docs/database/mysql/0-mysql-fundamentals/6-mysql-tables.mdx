# MySQL Tables

In the world of databases, tables are the foundation for storing and organizing data. If you think of a MySQL database as a filing cabinet, then tables are the individual folders that help organize related information. Understanding how to create and manage tables is fundamental to working with MySQL effectively.

## What are MySQL Tables?

A MySQL table is a structured collection of data organized into rows and columns. Each column has a specific data type that determines what kind of information it can store, while each row represents an individual record.

Let's visualize a simple table structure:

```mermaid
erDiagram
    STUDENTS {
        int student_id
        string first_name
        string last_name
        date date_of_birth
        string email
    }
```

## Creating Tables in MySQL

To create a table in MySQL, we use the `CREATE TABLE` statement. The basic syntax is:

```sql
CREATE TABLE table_name (
    column1 datatype constraints,
    column2 datatype constraints,
    ...
);
```

Let's create a simple table to store student information:

```sql
CREATE TABLE students (
    student_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    last_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    date_of_birth DATE,
    email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE,
    enrollment_date TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

Here's what happens when you run the above command:

```
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.42 sec)
```

Let's break down what we just did:

- `students` is our table name
- `student_id` is a column with an integer data type that automatically increments for each new record and serves as our primary key
- `first_name` and `last_name` are VARCHAR columns that cannot be empty (NOT NULL)
- `date_of_birth` is a DATE column that can be NULL (optional)
- `email` is a VARCHAR column with a UNIQUE constraint
- `enrollment_date` is a TIMESTAMP column that defaults to the current date and time

## MySQL Data Types

MySQL supports various data types to store different kinds of information. Here are the most commonly used ones:

### Numeric Types

- `INT` / `INTEGER`: Standard integer (-2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647)
- `SMALLINT`: Small integer (-32,768 to 32,767)
- `TINYINT`: Tiny integer (-128 to 127)
- `DECIMAL(M,D)`: Fixed-point number with M digits and D decimals
- `FLOAT`: Floating-point number

### String Types

- `VARCHAR(size)`: Variable-length string with a maximum size
- `CHAR(size)`: Fixed-length string
- `TEXT`: Long text string
- `ENUM`: String object with only one value from a list of possible values

### Date and Time Types

- `DATE`: Date in 'YYYY-MM-DD' format
- `TIME`: Time in 'HH:MM:SS' format
- `DATETIME`: Date and time combination in 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS' format
- `TIMESTAMP`: Timestamp stored as the number of seconds since '1970-01-01 00:00:00'

### Other Types

- `BINARY` / `VARBINARY`: Binary strings
- `BLOB`: Binary Large Object
- `JSON`: JSON-formatted data (MySQL 5.7.8 and later)

## Table Constraints

Constraints are rules applied to table columns to maintain data integrity:

- `PRIMARY KEY`: Uniquely identifies each record in a table
- `FOREIGN KEY`: Links data from one table to another
- `UNIQUE`: Ensures all values in a column are different
- `NOT NULL`: Ensures a column cannot have a NULL value
- `CHECK`: Ensures values in a column meet a specific condition
- `DEFAULT`: Sets a default value for a column

## Viewing Table Structure

After creating a table, you can view its structure using the `DESCRIBE` or `SHOW COLUMNS` commands:

```sql
DESCRIBE students;
```

Output:

```
+----------------+--------------+------+-----+-------------------+-------------------+
| Field          | Type         | Null | Key | Default           | Extra             |
+----------------+--------------+------+-----+-------------------+-------------------+
| student_id     | int          | NO   | PRI | NULL              | auto_increment    |
| first_name     | varchar(50)  | NO   |     | NULL              |                   |
| last_name      | varchar(50)  | NO   |     | NULL              |                   |
| date_of_birth  | date         | YES  |     | NULL              |                   |
| email          | varchar(100) | YES  | UNI | NULL              |                   |
| enrollment_date| timestamp    | YES  |     | CURRENT_TIMESTAMP |                   |
+----------------+--------------+------+-----+-------------------+-------------------+
6 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

Alternatively:

```sql
SHOW COLUMNS FROM students;
```

## Modifying Tables

As your application evolves, you may need to modify your table structure. MySQL provides several statements for this purpose.

### Adding a New Column

To add a new column to an existing table:

```sql
ALTER TABLE students ADD COLUMN phone VARCHAR(15);
```

Output:

```
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.45 sec)
Records: 0  Duplicates: 0  Warnings: 0
```

### Modifying an Existing Column

To change the properties of an existing column:

```sql
ALTER TABLE students MODIFY COLUMN phone VARCHAR(20);
```

Output:

```
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.56 sec)
Records: 0  Duplicates: 0  Warnings: 0
```

### Renaming a Column

To rename a column:

```sql
ALTER TABLE students CHANGE COLUMN phone contact_number VARCHAR(20);
```

Output:

```
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.38 sec)
Records: 0  Duplicates: 0  Warnings: 0
```

### Dropping a Column

To remove a column from your table:

```sql
ALTER TABLE students DROP COLUMN contact_number;
```

Output:

```
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.42 sec)
Records: 0  Duplicates: 0  Warnings: 0
```

## Creating Tables with Foreign Keys

Foreign keys are used to create relationships between tables. Let's create a `courses` table and a `enrollments` table that links students to courses:

```sql
CREATE TABLE courses (
    course_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    course_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    credits INT NOT NULL,
    department VARCHAR(50)
);

CREATE TABLE enrollments (
    enrollment_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    student_id INT,
    course_id INT,
    enrollment_date DATE DEFAULT (CURRENT_DATE),
    grade VARCHAR(2),
    FOREIGN KEY (student_id) REFERENCES students(student_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (course_id) REFERENCES courses(course_id)
);
```

This creates a relationship where each enrollment record is linked to a specific student and a specific course.

## Practical Example: School Database

Let's expand our school database example by adding some records and running queries:

```sql
-- Adding students
INSERT INTO students (first_name, last_name, date_of_birth, email)
VALUES 
('John', 'Doe', '2000-05-15', 'john.doe@example.com'),
('Jane', 'Smith', '2001-08-22', 'jane.smith@example.com'),
('Michael', 'Johnson', '1999-11-30', 'michael.j@example.com');

-- Adding courses
INSERT INTO courses (course_name, credits, department)
VALUES 
('Introduction to Programming', 3, 'Computer Science'),
('Database Design', 4, 'Computer Science'),
('Web Development', 3, 'Information Technology');

-- Enrolling students in courses
INSERT INTO enrollments (student_id, course_id, grade)
VALUES 
(1, 1, 'A'),
(1, 2, 'B+'),
(2, 1, 'A-'),
(2, 3, 'A'),
(3, 2, 'B');
```

Now we can retrieve meaningful data using JOIN operations:

```sql
-- Get all enrollments with student names and course names
SELECT 
    s.first_name, 
    s.last_name, 
    c.course_name, 
    e.enrollment_date, 
    e.grade
FROM 
    enrollments e
JOIN 
    students s ON e.student_id = s.student_id
JOIN 
    courses c ON e.course_id = c.course_id;
```

Output:

```
+------------+-----------+-----------------------------+----------------+-------+
| first_name | last_name | course_name                 | enrollment_date| grade |
+------------+-----------+-----------------------------+----------------+-------+
| John       | Doe       | Introduction to Programming | 2023-10-10    | A     |
| John       | Doe       | Database Design             | 2023-10-10    | B+    |
| Jane       | Smith     | Introduction to Programming | 2023-10-10    | A-    |
| Jane       | Smith     | Web Development             | 2023-10-10    | A     |
| Michael    | Johnson   | Database Design             | 2023-10-10    | B     |
+------------+-----------+-----------------------------+----------------+-------+
5 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

## Deleting Tables

If you need to remove a table completely, use the `DROP TABLE` statement:

```sql
DROP TABLE enrollments;
DROP TABLE courses;
DROP TABLE students;
```

It's important to drop tables in the correct order when foreign keys are involved - drop child tables before parent tables to avoid constraint errors.

## Best Practices for MySQL Tables

1. **Choose appropriate data types**: Select the most efficient data type for your columns to save space and improve performance.

2. **Name tables and columns clearly**: Use meaningful names that reflect the contents.

3. **Always include a primary key**: Every table should have a unique identifier.

4. **Normalize your data**: Split data into multiple related tables to reduce redundancy.

5. **Use indices for frequently queried columns**: Add indexes to columns used in WHERE clauses or joins.

6. **Document your design**: Keep notes about your table design and relationships.

7. **Consider character sets**: Choose appropriate character sets and collations for string columns.

8. **Limit the use of TEXT and BLOB types**: These can impact performance.
