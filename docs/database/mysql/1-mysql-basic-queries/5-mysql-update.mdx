# MySQL UPDATE Statement

The UPDATE statement is a fundamental part of MySQL that allows you to modify existing records in your database tables. This powerful data modification command is essential for maintaining current and accurate data in your applications.

## Introduction to UPDATE

In real-world applications, data often needs to be changed after it's initially inserted. User profiles get updated, prices change, and information needs correction. The MySQL UPDATE statement provides a way to modify existing records without having to delete and recreate them.

## Basic UPDATE Syntax

The basic syntax of the MySQL UPDATE statement is:

```sql
UPDATE table_name
SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ...
WHERE condition;
```

Let's break down each component:

- `UPDATE table_name`: Specifies which table to update records in
- `SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ...`: Defines which columns to modify and their new values
- `WHERE condition`: Optional clause that determines which records to update

:::caution
If you omit the WHERE clause, **all records** in the table will be updated! Always double-check your UPDATE statements before executing them.

## Simple UPDATE Examples

### Example 1: Update a Single Record

Let's say we have a `customers` table and want to update a customer's email address:

```sql
UPDATE customers
SET email = 'newemail@example.com'
WHERE customer_id = 1;
```

**Output:**
```
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.00 sec)
```

This statement updates the email address for the customer with `customer_id` of 1.

### Example 2: Update Multiple Columns

You can update multiple columns in a single UPDATE statement:

```sql
UPDATE products
SET price = 29.99, stock = 100
WHERE product_id = 5;
```

**Output:**
```
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.01 sec)
```

This statement updates both the price and stock quantity for product with ID 5.

## Using WHERE Clause Effectively

The WHERE clause is crucial for targeting specific records. You can use various operators:

```sql
-- Update based on equality
UPDATE employees SET salary = 55000 WHERE department = 'Marketing';

-- Update based on comparison
UPDATE products SET discount = 0.15 WHERE price > 100;

-- Update using LIKE for pattern matching
UPDATE customers SET status = 'Premium' WHERE email LIKE '%company.com';

-- Update using IN to match multiple values
UPDATE orders SET status = 'Processing' WHERE order_id IN (1001, 1008, 1012);
```

## UPDATE with Expressions and Functions

You can use expressions and functions in your UPDATE statements to calculate new values:

### Example: Increase prices by 10%

```sql
UPDATE products 
SET price = price * 1.10
WHERE category = 'Electronics';
```

### Example: Update date using function

```sql
UPDATE orders
SET last_modified = NOW()
WHERE status = 'Shipped';
```

### Example: Using CASE expression

```sql
UPDATE employees
SET bonus = CASE
    WHEN performance_score > 90 THEN salary * 0.15
    WHEN performance_score > 75 THEN salary * 0.10
    ELSE salary * 0.05
END
WHERE hire_date < '2023-01-01';
```

## UPDATE with Subqueries

You can use subqueries to make more dynamic updates:

```sql
UPDATE products
SET stock = stock - (
    SELECT SUM(order_quantity) 
    FROM order_items 
    WHERE order_items.product_id = products.product_id
    AND order_date = CURRENT_DATE()
)
WHERE product_id IN (
    SELECT DISTINCT product_id 
    FROM order_items 
    WHERE order_date = CURRENT_DATE()
);
```

This complex example subtracts today's ordered quantities from the product stock.

## UPDATE with JOIN

MySQL allows you to update records from one table based on values in another table using JOIN:

```sql
UPDATE customers c
JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
SET c.status = 'Active'
WHERE o.order_date > DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE(), INTERVAL 90 DAY);
```

This updates customers to 'Active' status if they've placed an order in the last 90 days.

## Real-world Applications

### User Profile Updates

```sql
UPDATE users
SET 
    first_name = 'John',
    last_name = 'Smith',
    profile_picture = 'john_new.jpg',
    last_updated = NOW()
WHERE user_id = 42;
```

### Inventory Management

```sql
-- After receiving a shipment
UPDATE inventory
SET 
    quantity_in_stock = quantity_in_stock + 50,
    last_restocked = CURRENT_DATE(),
    restock_required = FALSE
WHERE product_id = 789;
```

### Bulk Price Adjustments

```sql
-- Apply holiday discount
UPDATE products
SET 
    price = ROUND(price * 0.85, 2),  -- 15% discount, rounded to 2 decimal places
    on_sale = TRUE,
    sale_ends = DATE_ADD(CURRENT_DATE(), INTERVAL 14 DAY)  -- 2-week sale
WHERE category = 'Winter Gear';
```

## Best Practices for UPDATE Statements

1. **Always use the WHERE clause** unless you actually intend to update all rows
2. **Test with SELECT first** to verify you're targeting the correct rows:
   ```sql
   -- First, check which records will be affected
   SELECT * FROM customers WHERE customer_id = 1;
   
   -- Then perform the update if the results match expectations
   UPDATE customers SET email = 'newemail@example.com' WHERE customer_id = 1;
   ```
3. **Use transactions** for safety with important updates:
   ```sql
   START TRANSACTION;
   UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 1000 WHERE account_id = 123;
   UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 1000 WHERE account_id = 456;
   COMMIT;  -- Or ROLLBACK if something goes wrong
   ```
4. **Be mindful of performance** - updates on large tables with complex WHERE conditions can be slow

## LIMIT in UPDATE (MySQL specific)

MySQL allows you to limit the number of rows to update:

```sql
UPDATE customers
SET status = 'VIP'
WHERE signup_date < '2022-01-01'
ORDER BY total_purchases DESC
LIMIT 100;
```

This updates only the 100 longest-standing customers with the highest purchase totals to VIP status.

## Common Error Situations

### Foreign Key Constraints

If a column is referenced by a foreign key in another table, updates may be restricted:

```sql
-- This might fail if product_id is referenced elsewhere
UPDATE products 
SET product_id = 999 
WHERE product_id = 123;
```

### Type Conversion Issues

Be careful with type conversions:

```sql
-- This works but might truncate decimal places
UPDATE products SET price = '24.99' WHERE product_id = 5;

-- This will cause an error if 'not-a-number' can't be converted to a numeric type
UPDATE products SET price = 'not-a-number' WHERE product_id = 5;
```

## Summary

The MySQL UPDATE statement is an essential tool for data modification that allows you to:

- Change values in one or multiple columns
- Target specific records using the WHERE clause
- Use expressions, functions, and subqueries for dynamic updates
- Join tables to perform updates based on related data

Remember that proper use of the WHERE clause is critical to ensure you're only updating the records you intend to modify. Always double-check your queries, especially when working with production databases.

## Practice Exercises

1. Create a `students` table with columns for `student_id`, `name`, `grade`, and `last_updated`, then practice updating records.
2. Write an UPDATE statement that increases all product prices by 5% for a specific category.
3. Create an UPDATE statement that uses a CASE expression to assign different status levels based on customer purchase history.
4. Write an UPDATE with JOIN that modifies customer information based on their most recent order.
