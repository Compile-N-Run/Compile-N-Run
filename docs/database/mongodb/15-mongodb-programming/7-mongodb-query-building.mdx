# MongoDB Query Building

## Introduction

Query building is at the heart of MongoDB interactions. Whether you're retrieving documents, updating records, or performing complex data analysis, understanding how to construct effective queries is essential for any MongoDB developer.

In this tutorial, we'll explore MongoDB's query syntax, starting with basic document retrieval operations and gradually moving into more sophisticated queries with filtering, sorting, and aggregation capabilities. Along the way, you'll learn the best practices for optimizing your queries for better performance.

## Basic Query Structure

MongoDB queries are built using JSON-like documents. The primary method for querying collections is the `find()` method, which returns a cursor to the matching documents.

### The Find Method

The basic syntax for the `find()` method is:

```js
db.collection.find(query, projection)
```

Where:
- `query` is a document that specifies the selection criteria
- `projection` is an optional document that specifies which fields to return

Let's start with a simple example:

```js
// Find all documents in the 'users' collection
db.users.find()

// Find all users named "John"
db.users.find({ name: "John" })
```

**Output:**
```js
// For the second query, assuming there are two users named John
{ "_id" : ObjectId("5f8d3e2b9d3b2d8e1a2b3c4d"), "name" : "John", "age" : 25, "email" : "john@example.com" }
{ "_id" : ObjectId("5f8d3e2b9d3b2d8e1a2b3c5e"), "name" : "John", "age" : 32, "email" : "john.doe@example.com" }
```

### Projections

Projections allow you to return only specific fields from the matching documents:

```js
// Return only the name and email fields from all users
db.users.find({}, { name: 1, email: 1 })

// Exclude the _id field
db.users.find({}, { name: 1, email: 1, _id: 0 })
```

**Output:**
```js
// For the second query
{ "name" : "John", "email" : "john@example.com" }
{ "name" : "John", "email" : "john.doe@example.com" }
{ "name" : "Sarah", "email" : "sarah@example.com" }
// ... more results
```

## Query Operators

MongoDB provides various operators that allow you to build more complex queries.

### Comparison Operators

```js
// Find users who are 25 years old or younger
db.users.find({ age: { $lte: 25 } })

// Find users between 25 and 40 years old
db.users.find({ age: { $gte: 25, $lte: 40 } })

// Find users who are not named "John"
db.users.find({ name: { $ne: "John" } })
```

Here's a list of common comparison operators:

| Operator | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `$eq` | Equal to |
| `$ne` | Not equal to |
| `$gt` | Greater than |
| `$gte` | Greater than or equal to |
| `$lt` | Less than |
| `$lte` | Less than or equal to |
| `$in` | In an array |
| `$nin` | Not in an array |

### Logical Operators

```js
// Find users who are either 25 or named "John"
db.users.find({ 
  $or: [
    { age: 25 },
    { name: "John" }
  ]
})

// Find users who are both older than 30 AND have gmail addresses
db.users.find({ 
  $and: [
    { age: { $gt: 30 } },
    { email: /gmail\.com$/ }
  ]
})
```

Common logical operators include:

| Operator | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `$and` | Logical AND |
| `$or` | Logical OR |
| `$not` | Logical NOT |
| `$nor` | Logical NOR |

## Querying Arrays and Embedded Documents

MongoDB's flexibility with document structure allows for complex data models with arrays and nested documents.

### Querying Arrays

```js
// Find users who have "reading" as one of their hobbies
db.users.find({ hobbies: "reading" })

// Find users who have both "reading" and "coding" as hobbies
db.users.find({ hobbies: { $all: ["reading", "coding"] } })

// Find users with exactly 3 hobbies
db.users.find({ hobbies: { $size: 3 } })
```

### Querying Embedded Documents

```js
// Find users who live in New York
db.users.find({ "address.city": "New York" })

// Find users with a specific subdocument
db.users.find({
  address: { 
    city: "New York", 
    state: "NY", 
    zip: "10001" 
  }
})

// Find users who have a score of 85 or above in any subject
db.students.find({ "scores.score": { $gte: 85 } })
```

## Cursor Methods

The `find()` method returns a cursor, which provides several helpful methods for manipulating the query results.

### Sorting

```js
// Sort users by age in ascending order
db.users.find().sort({ age: 1 })

// Sort users by name (ascending) and then by age (descending)
db.users.find().sort({ name: 1, age: -1 })
```

### Limiting and Skipping

```js
// Return only the first 5 users
db.users.find().limit(5)

// Skip the first 10 users (useful for pagination)
db.users.find().skip(10).limit(10) // Returns results 11-20
```

## Advanced Query Techniques

### Text Searches

First, you need to create a text index:

```js
// Create a text index on the 'bio' field
db.users.createIndex({ bio: "text" })

// Perform a text search
db.users.find({ $text: { $search: "developer programmer" } })
```

### Geospatial Queries

For location-based data:

```js
// Create a 2dsphere index for location data
db.places.createIndex({ location: "2dsphere" })

// Find places within 5km of a point
db.places.find({
  location: {
    $near: {
      $geometry: {
        type: "Point",
        coordinates: [-73.9667, 40.78]
      },
      $maxDistance: 5000 // in meters
    }
  }
})
```

## Real-World Query Examples

Let's look at some practical examples that you might encounter in real applications.

### E-commerce Product Filtering

```js
// Find in-stock products in the "Electronics" category, priced between $500-$1000
db.products.find({
  category: "Electronics",
  price: { $gte: 500, $lte: 1000 },
  inStock: true
}).sort({ rating: -1 }) // Sort by highest rated first
```

### User Activity Tracking

```js
// Find users who have been active in the last 7 days
const oneWeekAgo = new Date();
oneWeekAgo.setDate(oneWeekAgo.getDate() - 7);

db.users.find({
  lastActiveDate: { $gte: oneWeekAgo }
}).sort({ activityCount: -1 }).limit(10) // Top 10 most active users
```

### Blog Post Filtering

```js
// Find published blog posts with the tag "MongoDB" and sort by date
db.posts.find({
  status: "published",
  tags: "MongoDB"
}).sort({ publishedDate: -1 })
```

## The Aggregation Pipeline

For more complex data transformations and analysis, MongoDB offers the aggregation pipeline.

```js
// Calculate the average age of users by country
db.users.aggregate([
  { $group: { 
    _id: "$country", 
    averageAge: { $avg: "$age" },
    count: { $sum: 1 }
  }},
  { $sort: { count: -1 } },
  { $limit: 5 }
])
```

**Output:**
```js
{ "_id" : "USA", "averageAge" : 34.7, "count" : 1250 }
{ "_id" : "India", "averageAge" : 29.3, "count" : 980 }
{ "_id" : "UK", "averageAge" : 37.1, "count" : 720 }
{ "_id" : "Canada", "averageAge" : 35.8, "count" : 450 }
{ "_id" : "Australia", "averageAge" : 33.2, "count" : 320 }
```

## Query Performance Optimization

### Using Indexes

Indexes are critical for query performance. Create indexes on fields that you frequently query:

```js
// Create a single-field index
db.users.createIndex({ email: 1 }) // 1 for ascending, -1 for descending

// Create a compound index
db.users.createIndex({ age: 1, country: 1 })
```

### Explain Plans

Use the `explain()` method to analyze how MongoDB executes your queries:

```js
// See execution stats for a query
db.users.find({ age: { $gte: 25 } }).explain("executionStats")
```

### Query Optimization Tips

1. **Be specific** - Narrow down your queries as much as possible
2. **Use covered queries** - A query is "covered" when all fields in the query are part of an index
3. **Avoid negation operators** - `$ne`, `$nin`, and `$not` typically perform poorly
4. **Use projection** - Only return fields you need
5. **Limit result size** - Use `limit()` when you don't need all results

```js
// A covered query example (assuming an index exists on both fields)
db.users.find(
  { age: { $gte: 25 } },
  { name: 1, age: 1, _id: 0 }
).hint({ age: 1, name: 1 })
```

2. Write a query to find all students taking "Computer Science" courses.
3. Find students who are older than 20 and live in "New York".
4. Write a query that uses the `$elemMatch` operator to find students who have a course with both a grade above 90 and completed in 2023.
5. Create an appropriate index for each of the queries above.
