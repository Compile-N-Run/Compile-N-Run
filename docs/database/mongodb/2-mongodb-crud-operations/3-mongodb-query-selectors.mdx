# MongoDB Query Selectors

## Introduction

Query selectors are a fundamental concept in MongoDB that allow you to filter documents in a collection based on specific criteria. If you're coming from the SQL world, you can think of query selectors as the MongoDB equivalent of the `WHERE` clause. However, MongoDB's query selectors offer more flexibility and power, especially when dealing with nested documents and arrays.

In this guide, we'll explore the various types of query selectors available in MongoDB, how to use them effectively, and when to apply each type for different scenarios. Whether you're querying simple values or complex document structures, understanding query selectors is essential for efficient MongoDB CRUD operations.

## Basic Query Selectors

Let's start with the basic comparison operators that MongoDB provides for filtering documents.

### Equality Operator

The simplest form of query is checking if a field equals a specific value:

```js
db.products.find({ price: 19.99 })
```

This query returns all documents from the `products` collection where the `price` field is exactly `19.99`.

### Comparison Operators

MongoDB provides several comparison operators to filter data:

| Operator | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `$eq` | Matches values that equal the specified value |
| `$gt` | Matches values greater than the specified value |
| `$gte` | Matches values greater than or equal to the specified value |
| `$lt` | Matches values less than the specified value |
| `$lte` | Matches values less than or equal to the specified value |
| `$ne` | Matches values that are not equal to the specified value |
| `$in` | Matches any of the values in an array |
| `$nin` | Matches none of the values in an array |

Let's see these in action:

```js
// Find products with price greater than 20
db.products.find({ price: { $gt: 20 } })

// Find products with price less than or equal to 50
db.products.find({ price: { $lte: 50 } })

// Find products with price either 10, 20, or 30
db.products.find({ price: { $in: [10, 20, 30] } })
```

### Logical Operators

MongoDB provides logical operators to combine multiple conditions:

| Operator | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `$and` | Joins query clauses with a logical AND |
| `$or` | Joins query clauses with a logical OR |
| `$not` | Inverts the effect of a query expression |
| `$nor` | Joins query clauses with a logical NOR |

Example usage:

```js
// Find products with price greater than 20 AND less than 50
db.products.find({
  $and: [
    { price: { $gt: 20 } },
    { price: { $lt: 50 } }
  ]
})

// You can simplify the AND logic for the same field
db.products.find({ price: { $gt: 20, $lt: 50 } })

// Find products that are either on sale OR have a price less than 20
db.products.find({
  $or: [
    { onSale: true },
    { price: { $lt: 20 } }
  ]
})
```

## Element Query Selectors

These selectors help you match documents based on the presence or absence of fields, or based on their type.

### $exists

This operator matches documents that have the specified field:

```js
// Find products that have a 'discount' field
db.products.find({ discount: { $exists: true } })

// Find products that don't have a 'discount' field
db.products.find({ discount: { $exists: false } })
```

### $type

This operator selects documents where the value of a field is of a specific BSON type:

```js
// Find products where price is a double (numeric) type
db.products.find({ price: { $type: "double" } })

// Find products where tags is an array
db.products.find({ tags: { $type: "array" } })
```

## Evaluation Query Selectors

These operators perform specific types of evaluations on the field values.

### $regex

The `$regex` operator provides pattern matching capabilities:

```js
// Find products with names containing "phone" (case-insensitive)
db.products.find({ name: { $regex: /phone/i } })
```

### $expr

The `$expr` operator allows you to use aggregation expressions within your query:

```js
// Find products where the discount price is less than half of the original price
db.products.find({
  $expr: {
    $lt: ["$discountPrice", { $multiply: ["$originalPrice", 0.5] }]
  }
})
```

## Array Query Selectors

These operators are particularly useful when working with arrays in your documents.

### $all

The `$all` operator selects documents where the array field contains all the specified elements:

```js
// Find products that have both "electronics" AND "gadgets" in their tags array
db.products.find({ tags: { $all: ["electronics", "gadgets"] } })
```

### $elemMatch

The `$elemMatch` operator matches documents that contain an array field with at least one element that matches all the specified query criteria:

```js
// Find products with at least one review that has a rating of 5 and is verified
db.products.find({
  reviews: {
    $elemMatch: {
      rating: 5,
      verified: true
    }
  }
})
```

### $size

The `$size` operator matches documents where an array field has a specific number of elements:

```js
// Find products that have exactly 3 tags
db.products.find({ tags: { $size: 3 } })
```

## Geospatial Query Selectors

If your application deals with geographic data, MongoDB offers several geospatial operators:

### $near

The `$near` operator returns documents in order of nearest to farthest from a specified point:

```js
// Find stores near a location (requires a geospatial index)
db.stores.find({
  location: {
    $near: {
      $geometry: {
        type: "Point",
        coordinates: [-73.9667, 40.78]
      },
      $maxDistance: 1000  // in meters
    }
  }
})
```

## Real-world Examples

Let's look at some practical examples of how query selectors can be used in real applications.

### E-commerce Product Filtering

Imagine we're building an e-commerce site with product filtering capabilities:

```js
// Find in-stock products in a specific category with a price range
db.products.find({
  category: "Smartphones",
  inStock: true,
  price: {
    $gte: 300,
    $lte: 800
  },
  rating: { $gte: 4.0 }
})
```

### User Analytics

For a social media application, you might want to find active users who meet certain criteria:

```js
// Find active users who joined in the last 30 days and have completed their profile
const thirtyDaysAgo = new Date(Date.now() - 30 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000);

db.users.find({
  active: true,
  joinDate: { $gte: thirtyDaysAgo },
  profileComplete: true,
  $or: [
    { "profile.age": { $gte: 18 } },
    { "profile.parentalConsent": true }
  ]
})
```

### Task Management

For a task management application:

```js
// Find high-priority tasks that are overdue but not assigned
const today = new Date();

db.tasks.find({
  priority: "high",
  dueDate: { $lt: today },
  assignedTo: { $exists: false },
  status: { $ne: "completed" }
})
```

## Combining Multiple Query Selectors

You can create complex queries by combining multiple selectors. Here's an example for an inventory management system:

```js
// Find products that:
// - Are either low in stock OR need reordering
// - AND are in certain categories
// - AND have been purchased in the last 90 days
const ninetyDaysAgo = new Date(Date.now() - 90 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000);

db.products.find({
  $and: [
    { $or: [
        { stockLevel: { $lt: 10 } },
        { needsReorder: true }
      ]
    },
    { category: { $in: ["Electronics", "Appliances", "Tools"] } },
    { "lastPurchased.date": { $gte: ninetyDaysAgo } }
  ]
})
```

## Query Selector Optimization Tips

1. **Use indexes** for fields that are frequently used in query selectors to improve performance.

2. **Be specific** with your queries. More specific queries can utilize indexes more efficiently.

3. **Avoid negation operators** like `$ne`, `$nin` when possible, as they typically can't use indexes effectively.

4. **Consider the order** of conditions in `$or` expressions. Try to put the condition most likely to be false first to minimize document scans.

5. **Use `$in` instead of `$or`** for multiple equality checks on the same field:

```js
// Less efficient
db.products.find({
  $or: [
    { category: "Electronics" },
    { category: "Gadgets" },
    { category: "Accessories" }
  ]
})

// More efficient
db.products.find({
  category: { $in: ["Electronics", "Gadgets", "Accessories"] }
})
```

## Summary

MongoDB query selectors are powerful tools that allow you to filter documents based on complex criteria. We've covered:

- **Basic selectors** for simple comparisons (`$eq`, `$gt`, `$lt`, etc.)
- **Logical operators** to combine conditions (`$and`, `$or`, `$not`, etc.)
- **Element selectors** to check field existence and types (`$exists`, `$type`)
- **Evaluation selectors** for pattern matching and expressions (`$regex`, `$expr`)
- **Array selectors** to work with array fields (`$all`, `$elemMatch`, `$size`)
- **Geospatial selectors** for location-based queries (`$near`, etc.)

By mastering these query selectors, you can create precise database queries that efficiently retrieve exactly the data you need.

## Exercise Ideas

1. Create a collection of books with various attributes (title, author, genres, published date, rating, etc.) and practice writing queries to:
   - Find books published after 2010 with a rating above 4
   - Find books by a specific author with a certain genre
   - Find books that have both "adventure" and "mystery" in their genres array

2. Build a collection representing a social network with users and their posts. Write queries to:
   - Find users who have made more than 5 posts in the last week
   - Find posts with specific tags that have received more than 10 likes
   - Find users who have commented on a specific post
