# MongoDB Geospatial Operators

## Introduction

MongoDB provides powerful geospatial capabilities that allow you to store and query location-based data efficiently. Geospatial operators enable you to perform proximity searches, find points within a specific area, calculate distances, and more. These features are particularly useful for applications like store locators, ride-sharing services, delivery tracking systems, or any application that needs to work with geographic data.

In this tutorial, we'll explore MongoDB's geospatial operators, how to use them, and practical examples to help you implement location-aware features in your applications.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into geospatial operators, you should:
- Have basic knowledge of MongoDB
- Understand how to perform CRUD operations in MongoDB
- Be familiar with MongoDB query operators

## Geospatial Data in MongoDB

### Data Formats

MongoDB supports two types of geospatial data:

1. **Legacy Coordinate Pairs**: Simple pairs of longitude and latitude values
2. **GeoJSON Objects**: A more feature-rich format that follows the GeoJSON specification

### GeoJSON Data Types

MongoDB supports various GeoJSON object types:

- **Point**: A single position
- **LineString**: A line of two or more points
- **Polygon**: A shape defined by a set of points
- **MultiPoint**: Multiple points
- **MultiLineString**: Multiple lines
- **MultiPolygon**: Multiple polygons
- **GeometryCollection**: A collection of different geometry types

## Setting Up Geospatial Indexes

Before using geospatial queries, you need to create the appropriate indexes.

### 2dsphere Index

This index is used for data stored as GeoJSON objects and supports queries that calculate geometries on an earth-like sphere.

```javascript
// Creating a 2dsphere index
db.places.createIndex({ location: "2dsphere" })
```

### 2d Index

This index is used for legacy coordinate pairs and supports queries on a flat, Euclidean plane.

```javascript
// Creating a 2d index
db.places.createIndex({ location: "2d" })
```

## Storing Geospatial Data

### GeoJSON Point Example

```javascript
db.places.insertOne({
  name: "Central Park",
  location: {
    type: "Point",
    coordinates: [-73.97, 40.77] // [longitude, latitude]
  },
  category: "park"
})
```

### GeoJSON Polygon Example

```javascript
db.neighborhoods.insertOne({
  name: "Downtown",
  area: {
    type: "Polygon",
    coordinates: [[
      [-73.99, 40.73],
      [-73.99, 40.76],
      [-73.97, 40.76],
      [-73.97, 40.73],
      [-73.99, 40.73]
    ]] // First and last coordinates must be the same to close the polygon
  },
  population: 25000
})
```

## Common Geospatial Operators

### $geoNear

The `$geoNear` operator is used in aggregation pipelines to find documents near a specific point.

```javascript
db.places.aggregate([
  {
    $geoNear: {
      near: { type: "Point", coordinates: [-73.98, 40.75] }, // Times Square
      distanceField: "distance",
      maxDistance: 1000, // in meters
      spherical: true,
      query: { category: "restaurant" }
    }
  }
])
```

This query finds restaurants within 1000 meters of Times Square and includes the distance in meters in the output.

### $near and $nearSphere

These operators find documents near a specified point:

```javascript
// Find coffee shops near a specific location, sorted by distance
db.places.find({
  location: {
    $near: {
      $geometry: {
        type: "Point",
        coordinates: [-73.98, 40.75]
      },
      $maxDistance: 2000, // in meters
      $minDistance: 200 // in meters
    }
  },
  category: "coffee"
})
```

### $geoWithin

The `$geoWithin` operator selects documents with geospatial data that exist entirely within a specified shape:

```javascript
// Find all places within a specific polygon (e.g., a neighborhood boundary)
db.places.find({
  location: {
    $geoWithin: {
      $geometry: {
        type: "Polygon",
        coordinates: [[
          [-73.99, 40.73],
          [-73.99, 40.76],
          [-73.97, 40.76],
          [-73.97, 40.73],
          [-73.99, 40.73]
        ]]
      }
    }
  }
})
```

### $geoIntersects

The `$geoIntersects` operator selects documents whose geospatial data intersects with a specified GeoJSON object:

```javascript
// Find all streets that intersect with a neighborhood
db.streets.find({
  path: {
    $geoIntersects: {
      $geometry: {
        type: "Polygon",
        coordinates: [[
          [-73.99, 40.73],
          [-73.99, 40.76],
          [-73.97, 40.76],
          [-73.97, 40.73],
          [-73.99, 40.73]
        ]]
      }
    }
  }
})
```

## Real-World Applications

### 1. Store Locator

A common use case for geospatial queries is finding stores near a user's location.

```javascript
// Sample store data
db.stores.insertMany([
  {
    name: "Downtown Store",
    location: { type: "Point", coordinates: [-73.98, 40.75] },
    type: "electronics"
  },
  {
    name: "Uptown Store",
    location: { type: "Point", coordinates: [-73.96, 40.78] },
    type: "electronics"
  },
  {
    name: "Brooklyn Store",
    location: { type: "Point", coordinates: [-73.99, 40.70] },
    type: "electronics"
  }
])

// Create a 2dsphere index
db.stores.createIndex({ location: "2dsphere" })

// Find stores within 5km of user's location, sorted by distance
function findNearbyStores(userLng, userLat, maxDistanceKm = 5) {
  return db.stores.find({
    location: {
      $nearSphere: {
        $geometry: {
          type: "Point",
          coordinates: [userLng, userLat]
        },
        $maxDistance: maxDistanceKm * 1000 // convert km to meters
      }
    }
  }).toArray()
}

// Example usage
const nearbyStores = findNearbyStores(-73.97, 40.76)
```

### 2. Geofencing

Geofencing is a technique where you trigger actions when a device enters or exits a predefined virtual boundary:

```javascript
// Define a geofence (e.g., a delivery zone)
db.geofences.insertOne({
  name: "Delivery Zone A",
  boundary: {
    type: "Polygon",
    coordinates: [[
      [-73.99, 40.73],
      [-73.99, 40.76],
      [-73.97, 40.76],
      [-73.97, 40.73],
      [-73.99, 40.73]
    ]]
  },
  deliveryFee: 2.99
})

// Create a 2dsphere index
db.geofences.createIndex({ boundary: "2dsphere" })

// Check if a delivery address is within a delivery zone
function checkDeliveryZone(lng, lat) {
  return db.geofences.findOne({
    boundary: {
      $geoIntersects: {
        $geometry: {
          type: "Point",
          coordinates: [lng, lat]
        }
      }
    }
  })
}

// Example usage
const deliveryZone = checkDeliveryZone(-73.98, 40.74)
if (deliveryZone) {
  console.log(`Address is in ${deliveryZone.name}. Delivery fee: $${deliveryZone.deliveryFee}`)
} else {
  console.log("Address is outside our delivery zones.")
}
```

### 3. Calculating Distance-Based Pricing

Many location-based services charge based on distance. Here's an example of how to calculate prices:

```javascript
db.rides.aggregate([
  {
    $geoNear: {
      near: { type: "Point", coordinates: [-73.98, 40.75] }, // Pickup location
      distanceField: "rideDistance",
      spherical: true,
      query: { status: "available" },
      distanceMultiplier: 0.001 // Convert meters to kilometers
    }
  },
  {
    $project: {
      driverName: 1,
      vehicleType: 1,
      distanceKm: "$rideDistance",
      estimatedPrice: { $multiply: ["$rideDistance", 0.5] }, // $0.50 per kilometer
      estimatedTime: { $multiply: ["$rideDistance", 2] } // 2 minutes per kilometer
    }
  }
])
```

## Geographic Visualization with MongoDB Charts

MongoDB Charts provides a way to visualize geospatial data. Although we won't explore it in detail, here's a sample workflow:

1. Set up MongoDB Charts
2. Connect to your MongoDB database
3. Create a new chart
4. Select a geospatial chart type (e.g., Scatter Plot on a Map)
5. Configure the chart to use your geospatial data

## Best Practices for Geospatial Queries

1. **Always create proper indexes**: Geospatial queries can be expensive without proper indexing.
2. **Be mindful of the Earth's curvature**: Use `$nearSphere` rather than `$near` for more accurate results over larger distances.
3. **Use appropriate units**: MongoDB uses meters for distances in GeoJSON queries.
4. **Remember the longitude-latitude order**: GeoJSON uses [longitude, latitude] order, which is the reverse of the common [latitude, longitude] format used in many applications.
5. **Close your polygons**: The first and last points in a polygon must be identical to "close" the shape.

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Incorrect coordinate order**: Remember GeoJSON uses [longitude, latitude] format.
2. **Missing or incomplete indexes**: Queries will be slow without proper indexing.
3. **Not accounting for the date line**: Queries that cross the 180th meridian may require special handling.
4. **Using too large a search radius**: Very large search areas can impact performance.

2. Implement a "territory management" system where each salesperson has a defined geographic area. Write queries to find which salesperson is responsible for a given address.
3. Build a simple "places of interest" database and create an API endpoint that returns nearby attractions sorted by distance from a user's current location.
4. Extend the geofencing example to track when a delivery driver enters and exits different delivery zones.

Happy coding with MongoDB's geospatial features!
