# MongoDB Version Upgrades

Version upgrades are an essential part of maintaining a healthy MongoDB deployment. They provide access to new features, performance improvements, security patches, and bug fixes. However, upgrading your MongoDB instances requires careful planning to ensure a smooth transition without data loss or application downtime.

## Introduction to MongoDB Version Upgrades

MongoDB regularly releases new versions with improvements and new capabilities. The upgrade process involves migrating from one version to another while ensuring data integrity and minimal service disruption. Whether you're upgrading a single standalone instance or a complex sharded cluster, understanding the upgrade process is crucial for successful deployment management.

### Why Upgrade MongoDB?

- **New Features**: Access to the latest capabilities and improvements
- **Performance Enhancements**: Better query optimization, storage efficiency
- **Bug Fixes**: Resolution of known issues
- **Security Updates**: Protection against vulnerabilities
- **Extended Support**: Continued maintenance for your database version

## Understanding MongoDB's Versioning Scheme

Before planning an upgrade, it's important to understand how MongoDB versioning works:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[MongoDB Version Number] --> B[Major Version]
    A --> C[Minor Version]
    A --> D[Patch Version]
    B -- "e.g. 4 in 4.4.10" --> E[Major changes]
    C -- "e.g. 4 in 4.4.10" --> F[Feature additions]
    D -- "e.g. 10 in 4.4.10" --> G[Bug fixes/security patches]
```

- **Major Versions** (e.g., 4.x to 5.x): Involve significant changes that may require application modifications
- **Minor Versions** (e.g., 4.2 to 4.4): Add new features with typically backwards-compatible changes
- **Patch Releases** (e.g., 4.4.9 to 4.4.10): Bug fixes and security updates without feature changes

## Planning Your Upgrade

### Step 1: Check Compatibility

Before upgrading, verify compatibility between your current version and target version:

```javascript
// Check current MongoDB version
db.version()
```

**Output**:
```
4.2.15
```

Then review the compatibility notes in MongoDB documentation for your target version.

### Step 2: Review Release Notes

MongoDB release notes provide important information about:

- New features
- Deprecated features
- Breaking changes
- Known issues
- Bug fixes

### Step 3: Test in a Development Environment

Create a test environment that mirrors your production setup:

```bash
# Create a dump of your production data
mongodump --uri="mongodb://username:password@production-host:27017/dbname" --out=/path/to/dump

# Restore to a test environment with the target MongoDB version
mongorestore --uri="mongodb://username:password@test-host:27017/dbname" /path/to/dump
```

Run your application against this test environment to check for any issues.

## Upgrade Paths

MongoDB requires following specific upgrade paths when moving between versions. You cannot skip multiple major releases.

### Recommended Upgrade Path Example:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[MongoDB 3.6] --> B[MongoDB 4.0]
    B --> C[MongoDB 4.2]
    C --> D[MongoDB 4.4]
    D --> E[MongoDB 5.0]
    E --> F[MongoDB 6.0]
```

### Feature Compatibility Version

MongoDB uses the Feature Compatibility Version (FCV) to ensure backward compatibility:

```javascript
// Check current FCV
db.adminCommand( { getParameter: 1, featureCompatibilityVersion: 1 } )

// Set FCV to prepare for upgrade
db.adminCommand( { setFeatureCompatibilityVersion: "4.4" } )
```

**Output for checking FCV**:
```json
{
  "featureCompatibilityVersion": {
    "version": "4.2"
  },
  "ok": 1
}
```

## Upgrade Process for Different Deployment Types

### Standalone MongoDB Instance

```bash
# 1. Create a backup
mongodump --uri="mongodb://username:password@host:27017/dbname" --out=/path/to/backup

# 2. Shut down the MongoDB server
mongosh admin --eval "db.shutdownServer()"

# 3. Replace the MongoDB binaries with the new version
# (Platform-specific steps for package manager or manual binary replacement)

# 4. Start MongoDB with new version
mongod --config /path/to/mongod.conf

# 5. Verify the version
mongosh --eval "db.version()"
```

### Replica Sets

For a replica set with minimal downtime:

1. Upgrade the secondary members one at a time:

```bash
# For each secondary member
mongosh admin --host secondary-host --eval "db.shutdownServer()"
# Update binaries on the secondary
mongod --config /path/to/mongod.conf
# Wait for the secondary to fully recover and sync
```

2. Step down the primary and upgrade it:

```bash
# Connect to the current primary
mongosh --host primary-host

# Step down the primary
db.adminCommand({ replSetStepDown: 300 })

# Upgrade the former primary (now secondary) as above
```

### Sharded Clusters

Sharded clusters require a specific upgrade order:

1. Disable the balancer:

```javascript
sh.stopBalancer()
```

2. Upgrade config servers (if they form a replica set)
3. Upgrade each shard (replica set) following the replica set procedure
4. Upgrade mongos routers
5. Re-enable the balancer:

```javascript
sh.startBalancer()
```

## Common Upgrade Issues and Solutions

### Index Compatibility Issues

Some MongoDB version upgrades require index rebuilds due to format changes:

```javascript
// Check for index inconsistencies
db.collection.reIndex()

// Rebuild all indexes in a database
db.runCommand({ reIndex: "*" })
```

### Storage Engine Migration

When upgrading from MMAPv1 to WiredTiger (older versions):

```bash
# Dump data from old version
mongodump --uri="mongodb://old-instance:27017/dbname" --out=/path/to/dump

# Start new MongoDB with WiredTiger
mongod --dbpath /new/data/path --storageEngine wiredTiger

# Restore data to new instance
mongorestore --uri="mongodb://new-instance:27017" /path/to/dump
```

### Authentication Changes

Some versions introduce changes to authentication mechanisms:

```javascript
// Update user authentication mechanisms if needed
db.adminCommand({
  updateUser: "username",
  mechanisms: ["SCRAM-SHA-256"]
})
```

## Post-Upgrade Tasks

After a successful upgrade:

1. Verify application functionality
2. Update the feature compatibility version:

```javascript
// Set featureCompatibilityVersion to the new version
db.adminCommand({ setFeatureCompatibilityVersion: "5.0" })
```

3. Enable new features specific to your version
4. Monitor performance and logs for any issues

## Rollback Procedure

If the upgrade fails, have a rollback plan ready:

```bash
# Stop the problematic MongoDB instance
mongosh admin --eval "db.shutdownServer()"

# Replace with old version binaries
# (Platform-specific steps)

# Restore from backup if necessary
mongorestore --uri="mongodb://username:password@host:27017" /path/to/backup

# Start MongoDB with old version
mongod --config /path/to/mongod.conf
```

## Real-World Example: Upgrading a Production System

Consider a company upgrading from MongoDB 4.2 to 4.4 for a critical e-commerce application:

1. **Preparation**:
   - Document the current deployment architecture
   - Create test environment with 4.4
   - Run application tests against test environment
   - Backup all databases

2. **Execution Plan**:
   - Schedule upgrade during low-traffic period
   - Communicate schedule to stakeholders
   - Upgrade dev/staging environments first
   - Follow the replica set upgrade procedure
   - Monitor the application throughout

3. **Code Example** - Pre-upgrade compatibility check script:

```javascript
// check-compatibility.js - Run before upgrade to detect potential issues

// Check MongoDB version
print("Current MongoDB version: " + db.version());

// Check feature compatibility version
let fcvResult = db.adminCommand({ getParameter: 1, featureCompatibilityVersion: 1 });
print("Current FCV: " + JSON.stringify(fcvResult.featureCompatibilityVersion));

// Check for deprecated features
let deprecatedCollections = [];
db.getMongo().getDBNames().forEach(function(dbName) {
  if (dbName !== "admin" && dbName !== "config" && dbName !== "local") {
    let dbCollections = db.getSiblingDB(dbName).getCollectionNames();
    // Check for collections using deprecated options or features
    // This is a simplified example - add specific checks as needed
    for (let i = 0; i < dbCollections.length; i++) {
      let collStats = db.getSiblingDB(dbName).runCommand({ collStats: dbCollections[i] });
      if (collStats.paddingFactor > 1) {  // Example check for deprecated padding factor
        deprecatedCollections.push(dbName + "." + dbCollections[i]);
      }
    }
  }
});

if (deprecatedCollections.length > 0) {
  print("WARNING: Found collections using deprecated features: " + deprecatedCollections.join(", "));
}

// Check for compatibility with authentication mechanisms
let authEnabled = db.adminCommand({ getParameter: 1, authenticationMechanisms: 1 });
print("Authentication mechanisms: " + JSON.stringify(authEnabled.authenticationMechanisms));
```

Run this script with:

```bash
mongosh --file check-compatibility.js
```
