# MongoDB Monitoring Tools

Monitoring your MongoDB deployment is critical for ensuring optimal performance, preventing outages, and planning for future growth. As your database scales to support more users or larger datasets, having the right monitoring tools in place becomes essential for maintaining reliability and performance.

## Introduction to MongoDB Monitoring

MongoDB deployments can vary from simple single-server instances to complex sharded clusters. Regardless of size, monitoring provides vital insights into:

- Database performance metrics
- Resource utilization
- Query execution statistics
- Replication health
- Sharding status
- Security events

In this guide, we'll explore the various tools available for MongoDB monitoring and how to implement them effectively.

## Why Monitor MongoDB?

Before diving into specific tools, let's understand why monitoring MongoDB is crucial:

1. **Performance Optimization**: Identify slow queries and optimize them
2. **Capacity Planning**: Track growth trends to plan for scaling
3. **Problem Detection**: Catch issues before they affect users
4. **Security**: Detect unauthorized access attempts
5. **Backup Verification**: Ensure backup processes are working correctly

## Built-in MongoDB Monitoring Tools

MongoDB provides several built-in commands and utilities for monitoring database health.

### 1. `db.serverStatus()`

This command returns a document with information about the database's state.

```javascript
db.serverStatus()
```

**Sample Output:**

```javascript
{
  "host": "mongodb-server",
  "version": "5.0.6",
  "process": "mongod",
  "pid": 12345,
  "uptime": 86400,
  "uptimeMillis": 86400000,
  "connections": {
    "current": 5,
    "available": 51195,
    "totalCreated": 100
  },
  // Many more metrics...
}
```

The output contains valuable information about connections, operations, memory usage, and more.

### 2. `db.currentOp()`

This command shows operations currently in progress.

```javascript
db.currentOp()
```

**Sample Output:**

```javascript
{
  "inprog": [
    {
      "type": "op",
      "host": "mongodb-server:27017",
      "desc": "conn57",
      "connectionId": 57,
      "opid": 123456,
      "secs_running": 2,
      "microsecs_running": 2000000,
      "op": "query",
      "ns": "test.collection",
      "query": { "status": "active" },
      "planSummary": "COLLSCAN"
    }
    // Other operations...
  ]
}
```

This is particularly useful for identifying long-running queries that might be causing performance issues.

### 3. `db.stats()`

Get statistics about the current database:

```javascript
db.stats()
```

**Sample Output:**

```javascript
{
  "db": "test",
  "collections": 4,
  "views": 0,
  "objects": 12345,
  "avgObjSize": 256,
  "dataSize": 3160320,
  "storageSize": 3842048,
  "numExtents": 0,
  "indexes": 5,
  "indexSize": 163840,
  "fsUsedSize": 42949672960,
  "fsTotalSize": 274877906944,
  "ok": 1
}
```

### 4. `db.collection.stats()`

Get statistics about a specific collection:

```javascript
db.users.stats()
```

**Sample Output:**

```javascript
{
  "ns": "test.users",
  "size": 1024000,
  "count": 10000,
  "avgObjSize": 102.4,
  "storageSize": 1310720,
  "capped": false,
  "wiredTiger": {
    // WiredTiger storage engine specifics...
  },
  "nindexes": 2,
  "totalIndexSize": 81920,
  "indexSizes": {
    "_id_": 40960,
    "username_1": 40960
  },
  "ok": 1
}
```

## MongoDB Compass

MongoDB Compass is the official GUI for MongoDB, providing visual insights into your data structure and performance metrics.

### Key Features

- **Real-time server statistics**: View operation execution times, memory usage, and more
- **Query optimization**: Analyze explain plans and index usage
- **Schema visualization**: Understand your data structure
- **Performance charts**: Track metrics over time

### Schema Analysis Example

Using Compass to analyze a collection's schema:

1. Connect to your MongoDB instance
2. Select a database and collection
3. Go to the "Schema" tab
4. Compass will sample documents and display field types, frequencies, and values

This visual analysis helps identify data inconsistencies and optimization opportunities without writing queries.

## MongoDB Cloud Manager / Ops Manager

For production environments, MongoDB offers more comprehensive monitoring solutions:

- **MongoDB Cloud Manager**: Cloud-hosted monitoring service
- **MongoDB Ops Manager**: Self-hosted monitoring for enterprise deployments

### Key Features

- **Real-time monitoring**: Track 100+ metrics
- **Custom alerts**: Get notified when metrics cross thresholds
- **Performance advisor**: Recommendations for optimization
- **Automated deployment**: Manage MongoDB instances

### Setting Up Alerts in Cloud Manager

Here's how to set up a basic alert for high CPU usage:

1. Navigate to the "Alerts" section
2. Click "New Alert"
3. Select "CPU Usage" as the metric
4. Set threshold to 80%
5. Configure notification method (email, SMS, etc.)
6. Save the alert

```javascript
// Example alert configuration in Automation API
{
  "eventTypeName": "HOST_CPU_UTILIZATION",
  "metricThreshold": {
    "metricName": "CPU_IDLE",
    "operator": "<",
    "threshold": 20,
    "mode": "AVERAGE",
    "units": "RAW"
  },
  "notificationInterval": 30,
  "enabled": true
}
```

## Prometheus and Grafana

For organizations using open-source monitoring stacks, Prometheus and Grafana provide powerful MongoDB monitoring capabilities.

### Setup Process

1. **Install MongoDB Exporter**: This exports MongoDB metrics in Prometheus format

```bash
# Download and install MongoDB exporter
wget https://github.com/percona/mongodb_exporter/releases/download/v0.20.7/mongodb_exporter-0.20.7.linux-amd64.tar.gz
tar xvzf mongodb_exporter-0.20.7.linux-amd64.tar.gz
sudo mv mongodb_exporter /usr/local/bin/
```

2. **Create a configuration file** for MongoDB Exporter:

```yaml
mongodb_uri: "mongodb://username:password@localhost:27017/admin"
enable_diagnostics: true
```

3. **Configure Prometheus** to scrape MongoDB metrics:

```yaml
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'mongodb'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:9216']
```

4. **Import Grafana Dashboard**: Import a pre-built MongoDB dashboard to Grafana

The resulting Grafana dashboard can visualize:
- Query rates and latencies
- Connection statistics
- Memory and CPU usage
- Document operations (inserts, updates, deletes)

## Monitoring with `mongostat` and `mongotop`

MongoDB ships with command-line utilities for monitoring:

### mongostat

`mongostat` provides a real-time view of database operations:

```bash
mongostat --host mongodb://localhost:27017
```

**Sample Output:**

```
insert query update delete getmore command dirty used flushes vsize  res qrw arw net_in net_out conn time
    *0    *0     *0     *0       0     2|0  0.0% 0.0%       0 350M 57M 0|0 0|0   157b   56.1k    2 Mar 7 09:38:24
    *0    *0     *0     *0       0     1|0  0.0% 0.0%       0 350M 57M 0|0 0|0   157b   55.9k    2 Mar 7 09:38:25
```

This displays operations per second, memory usage, and connection information.

### mongotop

`mongotop` shows read/write activity by collection:

```bash
mongotop 5  # Reports every 5 seconds
```

**Sample Output:**

```
2023-03-07T09:40:25.585+0000    connected to: mongodb://localhost/

                      ns    total    read    write    2023-03-07T09:40:30Z
        admin.system.roles      0ms     0ms      0ms
      admin.system.version      0ms     0ms      0ms
              local.oplog      0ms     0ms      0ms
             test.products    123ms    28ms     95ms
```

This helps identify which collections have the highest activity.

## Custom Monitoring Scripts

Sometimes custom monitoring may be required for specific needs. Here's a simple Node.js script to monitor database connections:

```javascript
const { MongoClient } = require('mongodb');

async function monitorConnections() {
  const client = new MongoClient('mongodb://localhost:27017');
  
  try {
    await client.connect();
    const admin = client.db('admin');
    
    // Check connections every 5 seconds
    setInterval(async () => {
      const status = await admin.command({ serverStatus: 1 });
      const connections = status.connections;
      
      console.log(`${new Date().toISOString()} - Connections: ${connections.current}/${connections.available}`);
      
      // Alert if connections exceed 80% capacity
      if (connections.current / (connections.current + connections.available) > 0.8) {
        console.error('WARNING: Connection usage above 80%');
        // Send alert via email, Slack, etc.
      }
    }, 5000);
    
  } catch (err) {
    console.error('Monitoring error:', err);
  }
}

monitorConnections();
```

You could extend this script to monitor additional metrics and integrate with notification systems.

## Best Practices for MongoDB Monitoring

Follow these guidelines for effective MongoDB monitoring:

1. **Monitor at Multiple Levels**:
   - Infrastructure level (CPU, memory, disk)
   - MongoDB server level (operations, connections)
   - Application level (response times, error rates)

2. **Set Appropriate Thresholds**: Establish baseline performance metrics before setting alert thresholds

3. **Implement Automated Alerts**: Ensure the right people are notified when issues occur

4. **Retain Historical Data**: Keep monitoring data to identify trends and for post-incident analysis

5. **Regular Review**: Periodically review monitoring setup to ensure it still meets your needs

## Monitoring Replication

For MongoDB replica sets, monitor these specific metrics:

- **Replication Lag**: Time between operations on primary and secondaries
- **Oplog Size**: Ensure it's large enough to handle replication delays
- **Election Events**: Unexpected primary changes could indicate issues

To check replication status:

```javascript
rs.status()
```

**Sample Output:**

```javascript
{
  "set": "myReplicaSet",
  "date": ISODate("2023-03-07T09:45:15.555Z"),
  "myState": 1,
  "members": [
    {
      "_id": 0,
      "name": "mongodb-server-1:27017",
      "health": 1,
      "state": 1,
      "stateStr": "PRIMARY",
      "uptime": 172800,
      "optime": {
        "ts": Timestamp(1678182315, 1),
        "t": 3
      },
      "optimeDate": ISODate("2023-03-07T09:45:15Z")
    },
    {
      "_id": 1,
      "name": "mongodb-server-2:27017",
      "health": 1,
      "state": 2,
      "stateStr": "SECONDARY",
      "uptime": 172700,
      "optime": {
        "ts": Timestamp(1678182313, 1),
        "t": 3
      },
      "optimeDate": ISODate("2023-03-07T09:45:13Z"),
      "lastHeartbeat": ISODate("2023-03-07T09:45:14Z"),
      "lastHeartbeatRecv": ISODate("2023-03-07T09:45:14Z"),
      "pingMs": 15
    }
    // More members...
  ]
}
```

## Monitoring Sharded Clusters

For sharded deployments, additional monitoring considerations include:

- **Balancer Activity**: Ensure chunks are distributing correctly
- **Chunk Distribution**: Check for hotspots on specific shards
- **Config Server Health**: Monitor the config servers that track cluster metadata

To check sharding status:

```javascript
sh.status()
```
