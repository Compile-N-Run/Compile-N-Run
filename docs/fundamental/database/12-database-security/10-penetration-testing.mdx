# Penetration Testing

## Introduction

Penetration testing, often abbreviated as "pen testing," is a simulated cyber attack against your database systems to check for exploitable vulnerabilities. Unlike automated vulnerability scanning, penetration testing involves human testers using their expertise to identify and exploit security weaknesses. For database security, penetration testing is crucial as databases often contain an organization's most sensitive information.

In this guide, we'll explore how penetration testing applies specifically to database systems, the methodologies used, common tools, and practical examples to help you understand how to assess and strengthen your database security posture.

## Why Database Penetration Testing Is Important

Databases are prime targets for attackers because they:

- Store valuable information (personal data, financial records, etc.)
- Often have direct connections to applications
- May contain vulnerabilities in configuration, access controls, or authentication
- Could provide lateral movement opportunities in a network

A successful database breach can lead to data theft, regulatory penalties, reputation damage, and significant financial losses.

## Database Penetration Testing Methodology

Let's break down the process of conducting a database penetration test:

    style F fill:#d0e0ff,stroke:#3355bb
```

### 1. Planning Phase

Define the scope and objectives of your database penetration test:

- Which database servers will be tested?
- What type of testing (black box, white box, or gray box)?
- What are the limitations and restrictions?
- What are you trying to protect (data confidentiality, integrity, availability)?

### 2. Reconnaissance

Gather information about the target database:

- Database type (MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server, MongoDB, etc.)
- IP addresses and ports
- Database versions and patch levels
- Connected applications
- Network architecture

Here's a simple example of database fingerprinting using Nmap:

```bash
# Scan for database services
nmap -p 1433,3306,5432,27017 target_ip

# More detailed scan of a MySQL server
nmap -sV -p 3306 --script mysql-info target_ip
```

### 3. Vulnerability Assessment

Identify potential security weaknesses in the database:

- Weak authentication mechanisms
- Misconfigured permissions
- Unpatched vulnerabilities
- Default credentials
- Insecure network configuration

You can use specialized tools like SQLmap for this purpose:

```bash
# Basic SQLmap scan against a web application
sqlmap -u "http://example.com/page.php?id=1" --dbs

# Direct testing against a MySQL database
sqlmap -d "mysql://user:password@target_ip:3306/database_name" --tables
```

### 4. Exploitation

Attempt to exploit discovered vulnerabilities to demonstrate real-world impact:

- SQL injection attacks
- Privilege escalation
- Authentication bypass
- Data extraction
- Password cracking

Let's look at a simple SQL injection example:

```sql
-- Original query (on the application side)
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '[user_input]' AND password = '[user_input]';

-- Malicious input to bypass authentication
username: admin' --
password: anything

-- Resulting query
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'admin' --' AND password = 'anything';
```

The `--` characters comment out the rest of the query, bypassing the password check.

### 5. Post-Exploitation

Once access is gained, assess the potential damage:

- What sensitive data is accessible?
- Can you escalate privileges further?
- Is lateral movement to other systems possible?
- Can you maintain persistence?

For example, after gaining access to a database, you might extract password hashes:

```sql
-- In MySQL
SELECT user, authentication_string FROM mysql.user;

-- In PostgreSQL
SELECT usename, passwd FROM pg_shadow;

-- In SQL Server
SELECT name, password_hash FROM sys.sql_logins;
```

### 6. Reporting

Document findings clearly:

- Vulnerabilities discovered
- Exploitation methods
- Potential impact
- Remediation recommendations
- Evidence (screenshots, extracted data samples)

## Common Database Penetration Testing Tools

Here are some popular tools used for database penetration testing:

| Tool Name | Description | Database Types |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| SQLmap | Automated SQL injection tool | Most SQL databases |
| Metasploit | Exploitation framework with database modules | Various |
| Nmap | Network scanner with database scripts | Various |
| Hydra | Password brute-forcing tool | Various |
| DBeaver | Database management tool useful for manual testing | Most databases |

## Practical Example: Testing a MySQL Database

Let's walk through a simplified penetration test against a MySQL database:

### Step 1: Identify the target

```bash
# Scan for MySQL services
nmap -p 3306 192.168.1.0/24
```

Output:
```
Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org )
Nmap scan report for db-server.local (192.168.1.15)
Host is up (0.0080s latency).

PORT     STATE SERVICE
3306/tcp open  mysql

Nmap done: 256 IP addresses (1 host up) scanned in 8.45 seconds
```

### Step 2: Gather information about the MySQL server

```bash
nmap -sV -p 3306 --script mysql-info 192.168.1.15
```

Output:
```
Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org )
Nmap scan report for db-server.local (192.168.1.15)
Host is up (0.0090s latency).

-- List databases
SHOW DATABASES;

-- Switch to a database
USE customer_db;

-- List tables
SHOW TABLES;

-- View table structure
DESCRIBE users;

-- Extract sensitive data
SELECT username, email, password FROM users LIMIT 10;
```

Output:
```

## Protecting Your Databases

Based on penetration testing findings, implement these security measures:

### 1. Secure Authentication

- Use strong, complex passwords
- Implement multi-factor authentication where possible
- Remove default accounts or change their credentials
- Implement account lockout policies

```sql
-- Create a user with a strong password
CREATE USER 'app_user'@'10.0.0.%' IDENTIFIED BY 'p@ssw0rd-C0mpl3x!';

-- Set password policy (MySQL 8.0+)
SET GLOBAL validate_password.policy = 'STRONG';
SET GLOBAL validate_password.length = 12;
```

### 2. Implement Proper Access Controls

- Apply the principle of least privilege
- Restrict network access to database servers
- Use database firewalls or WAFs
- Regularly audit user permissions

```sql
-- Grant only necessary permissions
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE ON customer_db.products TO 'app_user'@'10.0.0.%';

-- Revoke dangerous permissions
REVOKE FILE ON *.* FROM 'app_user'@'10.0.0.%';
```

### 3. Patch and Update Regularly

- Subscribe to security advisories for your database software
- Test and apply security patches promptly
- Maintain updated documentation of database versions and patches

### 4. Encrypt Sensitive Data

- Implement TLS/SSL for data in transit
- Use transparent data encryption for data at rest
- Hash and salt stored passwords

```sql
-- Enable SSL connections in MySQL
ALTER USER 'app_user'@'10.0.0.%' REQUIRE SSL;

-- For data at rest (SQL Server example)
CREATE DATABASE customer_db
ENCRYPTION = ON;
```

### 5. Regular Backups and Monitoring

- Implement comprehensive logging
- Set up alerts for suspicious activities
- Regularly test backup restoration procedures

## Summary

Database penetration testing is a critical component of a robust security strategy. By simulating real-world attacks in a controlled environment, you can identify and address vulnerabilities before malicious actors exploit them. The key steps include reconnaissance, vulnerability assessment, exploitation, and thorough reporting.

Remember that penetration testing is not a one-time activity but an ongoing process. As your database environment evolves and new threats emerge, regular testing helps maintain a strong security posture.
