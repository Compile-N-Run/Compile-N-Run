# Modular Arithmetic

## Introduction

Modular arithmetic is a fundamental concept in number theory that deals with remainders when dividing integers. It's often described as "clock arithmetic" because it wraps around after reaching a certain value, just like how a 12-hour clock works. After 12, we start back at 1 instead of continuing to 13, 14, etc.

In programming, modular arithmetic is incredibly useful for:
- Hashing functions
- Cryptography algorithms
- Random number generation
- Solving problems with cyclic patterns
- Preventing integer overflow

This guide will explain modular arithmetic from the ground up and show how to implement it in code.

## The Basics of Modular Arithmetic

### What is the Modulo Operation?

The modulo operation finds the remainder after division of one number by another. We write:

$$a \bmod m$$

Which means "a modulo m" - the remainder when a is divided by m.

For example:
- 7 mod 3 = 1 (7 ÷ 3 = 2 with remainder 1)
- 15 mod 4 = 3 (15 ÷ 4 = 3 with remainder 3)
- 20 mod 5 = 0 (20 ÷ 5 = 4 with remainder 0)

In most programming languages, this operation is represented by the `%` operator:

```python
print(7 % 3)  # Output: 1
print(15 % 4)  # Output: 3
print(20 % 5)  # Output: 0
```

### Congruence Relation

We say that two numbers a and b are congruent modulo m if they have the same remainder when divided by m.

We write this as:

$$a \equiv b \pmod{m}$$

For example:
- 7 ≡ 1 (mod 3) because both 7 and 1 leave remainder 1 when divided by 3
- 15 ≡ 3 (mod 4) because both 15 and 3 leave remainder 3 when divided by 4
- 20 ≡ 0 (mod 5) because both 20 and 0 leave remainder 0 when divided by 5

In code, we can check if two numbers are congruent modulo m:

```python
def are_congruent(a, b, m):
    return a % m == b % m

print(are_congruent(7, 1, 3))  # Output: True
print(are_congruent(15, 3, 4))  # Output: True
print(are_congruent(20, 0, 5))  # Output: True
print(are_congruent(8, 3, 5))  # Output: False
```

## Properties of Modular Arithmetic

Modular arithmetic follows several important properties that make it useful in algorithms:

### 1. Addition and Subtraction

$$(a + b) \bmod m = ((a \bmod m) + (b \bmod m)) \bmod m$$
$$(a - b) \bmod m = ((a \bmod m) - (b \bmod m)) \bmod m$$

```python
def modular_add(a, b, m):
    return (a % m + b % m) % m

def modular_subtract(a, b, m):
    return (a % m - b % m) % m

print(modular_add(14, 23, 10))  # Output: 7
print(modular_subtract(14, 23, 10))  # Output: 1
```

### 2. Multiplication

$$(a \times b) \bmod m = ((a \bmod m) \times (b \bmod m)) \bmod m$$

```python
def modular_multiply(a, b, m):
    return (a % m * b % m) % m

print(modular_multiply(15, 18, 7))  # Output: 4
```

### 3. Exponentiation

Computing large powers efficiently using modular arithmetic:

```python
def modular_power(base, exponent, modulus):
    if modulus == 1:
        return 0
    
    result = 1
    base = base % modulus
    
    while exponent > 0:
        # If exponent is odd, multiply result with base
        if exponent % 2 == 1:
            result = (result * base) % modulus
        
        # Exponent is even, square the base
        exponent = exponent >> 1  # Divide exponent by 2
        base = (base * base) % modulus
    
    return result

print(modular_power(2, 10, 1000))  # Output: 24
print(modular_power(3, 100, 1000))  # Output: 343
```

This algorithm is much more efficient than computing the full power and then taking modulo, especially for large exponents.

## Modular Inverse

The modular inverse of a number `a` with respect to modulo `m` is another number `x` such that:

$$a \times x \equiv 1 \pmod{m}$$

The modular inverse exists if and only if `a` and `m` are coprime (their greatest common divisor is 1).

We can compute the modular inverse using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm:

```python
def extended_gcd(a, b):
    if a == 0:
        return b, 0, 1
    else:
        gcd, x, y = extended_gcd(b % a, a)
        return gcd, y - (b // a) * x, x

def modular_inverse(a, m):
    gcd, x, y = extended_gcd(a, m)
    
    if gcd != 1:
        raise Exception("Modular inverse does not exist")
    else:
        return (x % m + m) % m  # Ensure result is positive

# Example
print(modular_inverse(3, 11))  # Output: 4
# Verification: (3 * 4) % 11 = 1
```

## Solving Congruence Equations

A linear congruence equation has the form:

$$ax \equiv b \pmod{m}$$

The solution is:

$$x \equiv a^{-1}b \pmod{m}$$

where $a^{-1}$ is the modular inverse of a.

```python
def solve_congruence(a, b, m):
    try:
        a_inv = modular_inverse(a, m)
        return (a_inv * b) % m
    except Exception as e:
        return f"No solution: {e}"

# Solve: 3x ≡ 5 (mod 11)
print(solve_congruence(3, 5, 11))  # Output: 9
# Verification: (3 * 9) % 11 = 5
```

## The Chinese Remainder Theorem

The Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) lets us solve systems of congruence equations:

$$x \equiv a_1 \pmod{m_1}$$
$$x \equiv a_2 \pmod{m_2}$$
$$\vdots$$
$$x \equiv a_n \pmod{m_n}$$

Where all $m_i$ are pairwise coprime.

Here's how to implement it:

```python
def chinese_remainder_theorem(remainders, moduli):
    # Ensure inputs are lists
    if not isinstance(remainders, list) or not isinstance(moduli, list):
        raise TypeError("Inputs must be lists")
    
    # Ensure equal length
    if len(remainders) != len(moduli):
        raise ValueError("Number of remainders must equal number of moduli")
    
    # Calculate product of all moduli
    product = 1
    for modulus in moduli:
        product *= modulus
    
    result = 0
    for i in range(len(moduli)):
        partial_product = product // moduli[i]
        inverse = modular_inverse(partial_product, moduli[i])
        result += remainders[i] * partial_product * inverse
    
    return result % product

# Solve the system:
# x ≡ 2 (mod 3)
# x ≡ 3 (mod 5)
# x ≡ 2 (mod 7)
print(chinese_remainder_theorem([2, 3, 2], [3, 5, 7]))  # Output: 23
```

## Practical Applications

### 1. Hashing Functions

Modular arithmetic is used in hash functions to map data to a fixed-size array:

```python
def simple_hash(string, table_size):
    hash_value = 0
    for char in string:
        hash_value = (hash_value * 31 + ord(char)) % table_size
    return hash_value

# Example hash values
print(simple_hash("apple", 100))  # Output: 54
print(simple_hash("banana", 100))  # Output: 32
print(simple_hash("cherry", 100))  # Output: 11
```

### 2. Cryptography

Many cryptographic algorithms like RSA use modular arithmetic:

```python
def simple_rsa_example():
    # Very simplified RSA example (not secure!)
    p, q = 11, 13
    n = p * q  # Public modulus
    phi = (p-1) * (q-1)
    
    # Public exponent
    e = 7
    
    # Private exponent (modular inverse of e modulo phi)
    d = modular_inverse(e, phi)
    
    # Original message
    message = 9
    
    # Encryption: c = m^e mod n
    ciphertext = modular_power(message, e, n)
    
    # Decryption: m = c^d mod n
    decrypted = modular_power(ciphertext, d, n)
    
    return {
        "public_key": (n, e),
        "private_key": d,
        "message": message,
        "ciphertext": ciphertext,
        "decrypted": decrypted
    }

result = simple_rsa_example()
print(f"Message: {result['message']}")
print(f"Encrypted: {result['ciphertext']}")
print(f"Decrypted: {result['decrypted']}")
```

### 3. Clock Problems

Modular arithmetic can help solve time-related problems:

```python
def what_time_is_it(current_hour, hours_ahead):
    return (current_hour + hours_ahead) % 12 or 12

# If it's 10 o'clock now, what time will it be in 5 hours?
print(what_time_is_it(10, 5))  # Output: 3
```

### 4. Cyclic Phenomena

Many natural and programming problems involve cycles:

```python
def day_of_week(start_day, days_ahead):
    days = ["Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday", "Sunday"]
    start_index = days.index(start_day)
    return days[(start_index + days_ahead) % 7]

# If today is Wednesday, what day will it be 10 days from now?
print(day_of_week("Wednesday", 10))  # Output: Saturday
```

## Common Pitfalls and Tips

### Negative Numbers in Modular Arithmetic

In mathematics, the result of a modulo operation is always between 0 and m-1. However, some programming languages (like C and C++) might return negative results for negative inputs.

```python
# Python handles negative modulo correctly
print(-7 % 3)  # Output: 2 (not -1)

# To ensure consistent behavior across languages:
def positive_modulo(n, m):
    return ((n % m) + m) % m

print(positive_modulo(-7, 3))  # Output: 2
```

### Modular Arithmetic with Large Numbers

When dealing with very large numbers, direct computation might cause overflow. Use the properties of modular arithmetic to keep intermediate results small:

```python
def large_modular_power(base, exponent, modulus):
    """
    Compute (base^exponent) % modulus efficiently 
    even for very large exponents
    """
    return modular_power(base, exponent, modulus)

# Computing 3^1000000 % 1000000007
print(large_modular_power(3, 1000000, 1000000007))
```

## Summary
