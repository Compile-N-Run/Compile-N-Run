# Euler Totient Function

## Introduction

The Euler Totient Function, denoted as φ(n) (phi of n), is a fundamental concept in number theory that counts the positive integers up to n that are coprime to n (i.e., having greatest common divisor of 1 with n). Named after the Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler, this function plays a crucial role in various cryptographic algorithms, particularly RSA encryption, modular arithmetic, and other number-theoretic applications.

In this tutorial, you will learn:
- What the Euler Totient Function is and its mathematical definition
- How to calculate φ(n) for any positive integer
- Efficient algorithms to compute the totient function
- Properties of the totient function
- Practical applications in cryptography and programming

## Definition and Basic Understanding

The Euler Totient Function φ(n) counts the number of integers k in the range 1 ≤ k ≤ n such that gcd(n, k) = 1.

For example:
- φ(1) = 1, since gcd(1, 1) = 1
- φ(7) = 6, since gcd(7, k) = 1 for k = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
- φ(12) = 4, since gcd(12, k) = 1 only for k = 1, 5, 7, 11

### Properties of the Euler Totient Function

1. **For prime numbers**: If p is prime, then φ(p) = p - 1
2. **Multiplicative function**: If gcd(m, n) = 1, then φ(m × n) = φ(m) × φ(n)
3. **For prime powers**: If p is prime and k ≥ 1, then φ(p^k) = p^k - p^(k-1) = p^k(1 - 1/p)
4. **Formula**: φ(n) = n × ∏(1 - 1/p) for all prime p that divide n

## Computing the Euler Totient Function

### Naive Approach

The most straightforward way to compute φ(n) is to count the numbers from 1 to n that are coprime to n:

```python
def gcd(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a

def phi_naive(n):
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    
    count = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if gcd(n, i) == 1:
            count += 1
    
    return count
```

### Efficient Implementation Using Prime Factorization

A more efficient approach uses the properties of the totient function and prime factorization:

```python
def phi(n):
    result = n  # Initialize result as n
    
    # Consider all prime factors of n and subtract their
    # multiples from result
    p = 2
    while p * p <= n:
        # Check if p is a prime factor
        if n % p == 0:
            # If yes, then update n and result
            while n % p == 0:
                n //= p
            result -= result // p
        p += 1
    
    # If n has a prime factor greater than sqrt(n)
    # (There can be at most one such prime factor)
    if n > 1:
        result -= result // n
        
    return result
```

Let's understand this with an example:

For n = 36:
1. First prime factor is 2: 36 = 2^2 × 3^2
2. Update result = 36 - (36/2) = 36 - 18 = 18
3. Next prime factor is 3: Update result = 18 - (18/3) = 18 - 6 = 12
4. φ(36) = 12

## Sieve-based Implementation for Multiple Values

If we need to compute φ(n) for multiple values or for all numbers from 1 to n, we can use a sieve-based approach similar to the Sieve of Eratosthenes:

```python
def phi_1_to_n(n):
    phi = [i for i in range(n + 1)]
    
    for p in range(2, n + 1):
        if phi[p] == p:  # p is prime
            phi[p] = p - 1
            for i in range(2 * p, n + 1, p):
                phi[i] = (phi[i] // p) * (p - 1)
    
    return phi
```

This efficiently calculates φ(n) for all numbers from 1 to n.

## Applications of the Euler Totient Function

### 1. Euler's Theorem and Modular Exponentiation

Euler's theorem states that if a and n are coprime, then:

```
a^φ(n) ≡ 1 (mod n)
```

This is crucial for efficient modular exponentiation and forms the theoretical basis for RSA encryption.

```python
def modular_exponentiation(base, exponent, modulus):
    if modulus == 1:
        return 0
    
    result = 1
    base = base % modulus
    
    while exponent > 0:
        if exponent % 2 == 1:
            result = (result * base) % modulus
        
        exponent = exponent >> 1
        base = (base * base) % modulus
    
    return result
```

### 2. RSA Encryption Algorithm

The RSA encryption algorithm relies heavily on the Euler Totient Function. In RSA:

1. Choose two distinct prime numbers p and q
2. Compute n = p × q
3. Compute φ(n) = φ(p) × φ(q) = (p-1) × (q-1)
4. Choose an integer e such that 1 < e < φ(n) and gcd(e, φ(n)) = 1
5. Determine d as the modular multiplicative inverse of e modulo φ(n)

Here's a simplified implementation of the RSA key generation:

```python
import random

def is_prime(n, k=5):
    # Miller-Rabin primality test
    if n <= 1 or n == 4:
        return False
    if n <= 3:
        return True
    
    # Find r and d such that n-1 = 2^r * d
    d = n - 1
    r = 0
    while d % 2 == 0:
        d //= 2
        r += 1
    
    # Witness loop
    for _ in range(k):
        a = random.randint(2, n - 2)
        x = pow(a, d, n)
        if x == 1 or x == n - 1:
            continue
        for _ in range(r - 1):
            x = pow(x, 2, n)
            if x == n - 1:
                break
        else:
            return False
    return True

def generate_rsa_keys(key_size=1024):
    # Generate two random prime numbers
    p = generate_large_prime(key_size // 2)
    q = generate_large_prime(key_size // 2)
    while p == q:
        q = generate_large_prime(key_size // 2)
    
    n = p * q
    phi_n = (p - 1) * (q - 1)  # φ(n) = φ(p) * φ(q) = (p-1) * (q-1)
    
    # Choose e such that gcd(e, φ(n)) = 1
    e = 65537  # Common choice for e
    while gcd(e, phi_n) != 1:
        e += 2
    
    # Compute d such that (d * e) % φ(n) = 1
    d = mod_inverse(e, phi_n)
    
    return ((n, e), (n, d))  # Public key, Private key

def generate_large_prime(bits):
    # Implementation detail omitted for brevity
    pass

def mod_inverse(a, m):
    g, x, y = extended_gcd(a, m)
    if g != 1:
        raise Exception('Modular inverse does not exist')
    else:
        return x % m

def extended_gcd(a, b):
    if a == 0:
        return b, 0, 1
    else:
        g, x, y = extended_gcd(b % a, a)
        return g, y - (b // a) * x, x
```

### 3. Calculating Cyclic Groups in Modular Arithmetic

The totient function helps determine the size of multiplicative groups in modular arithmetic, which is essential for algorithms like Diffie-Hellman key exchange.

[//]: # (    18: 6)

[//]: # (    19: 18)

[//]: # (    20: 8)

[//]: # (```)

Notice how φ(n) reaches its maximum relative to n for prime numbers, and how composite numbers have lower values.

## Interesting Properties and Theorems

### Euler's Product Formula

For any positive integer n:

```
φ(n) = n × ∏(1 - 1/p)
```

Where the product is over all distinct prime factors p of n.

### Gauss's Theorem

For any positive integer n:

```
∑ φ(d) = n
```

Where the sum is over all positive divisors d of n.

We can verify this for n = 12:
- Divisors of 12: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12
- φ(1) + φ(2) + φ(3) + φ(4) + φ(6) + φ(12) = 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 4 = 12

## Time and Space Complexity Analysis

1. **Naive approach**: O(n × log n) time complexity due to GCD calculations
2. **Prime factorization approach**: O(sqrt(n)) time complexity
3. **Sieve-based approach**: O(n log log n) time complexity for computing φ(i) for all i from 1 to n
