# Tabulation Technique

## Introduction

Dynamic Programming (DP) is a powerful algorithmic paradigm for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems. There are two primary approaches to implement DP solutions: **Memoization** (top-down) and **Tabulation** (bottom-up).

This tutorial focuses on the Tabulation technique, which is an iterative, bottom-up approach where we solve smaller subproblems first and use their results to build solutions to larger problems. The name comes from the process of filling in a "table" (usually an array) with solutions to subproblems.

## Tabulation vs Memoization

Before diving deep into Tabulation, let's understand how it differs from Memoization:

| Tabulation (Bottom-Up) | Memoization (Top-Down) |
|------------------------|------------------------|
| Iterative approach     | Recursive approach     |
| Starts from the smallest subproblems | Starts from the original problem |
| No recursion overhead  | Has recursion overhead |
| Space efficiency can be optimized | Usually requires space for all subproblems |
| Order of subproblems must be carefully determined | Natural problem decomposition |

## Core Principles of Tabulation

1. **Identify the subproblems**: Break down the original problem into smaller, overlapping subproblems.
2. **Define the state**: Create a table (usually an array or matrix) to store solutions to subproblems.
3. **Base cases**: Initialize the table with solutions to the smallest subproblems.
4. **State transition**: Define how to build solutions to larger problems using solutions to smaller ones.
5. **Fill the table**: Iterate through the table in the right order, filling in each cell.
6. **Extract the solution**: The answer to the original problem is typically found in the last cell(s).

## Basic Example: Fibonacci Sequence

Let's implement the classic Fibonacci sequence using tabulation:

```javascript
function fibTabulation(n) {
    // Step 1: Create a table (array) to store solutions to subproblems
    const dp = new Array(n + 1).fill(0);
    
    // Step 2: Initialize base cases
    dp[0] = 0;
    dp[1] = 1;
    
    // Step 3: Fill the table iteratively
    for (let i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
        dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2];
    }
    
    // Step 4: Return the solution
    return dp[n];
}

// Example usage
console.log(fibTabulation(6));  // Output: 8
console.log(fibTabulation(10)); // Output: 55
```

In this example:
- We create an array `dp` of size `n+1` to store Fibonacci numbers from 0 to n
- We initialize the base cases: F(0) = 0 and F(1) = 1
- We iteratively fill the table for i from 2 to n using the recurrence relation F(i) = F(i-1) + F(i-2)
- Finally, we return dp[n], which contains the nth Fibonacci number

## Step-by-Step Example: Climbing Stairs Problem

Let's solve a common problem: **Climbing Stairs**.

**Problem Statement**: You are climbing a staircase with n steps. Each time you can climb either 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

### Step 1: Identify the subproblems
- Let dp[i] = number of ways to climb i stairs

### Step 2: Define the state
```javascript
const dp = new Array(n + 1).fill(0);
```

### Step 3: Base cases
- dp[0] = 1 (There's one way to climb 0 stairs: don't climb)
- dp[1] = 1 (There's one way to climb 1 stair: take one step)

### Step 4: State transition
- dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2] (Ways to climb i stairs = ways to climb i-1 stairs + ways to climb i-2 stairs)

### Step 5: Fill the table

```javascript
function climbStairs(n) {
    if (n <= 1) return 1;
    
    const dp = new Array(n + 1).fill(0);
    dp[0] = 1;
    dp[1] = 1;
    
    for (let i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
        dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2];
    }
    
    return dp[n];
}

// Example usage
console.log(climbStairs(3));  // Output: 3
console.log(climbStairs(5));  // Output: 8
```

For climbStairs(3), the process fills the table as follows:
- dp[0] = 1 (base case)
- dp[1] = 1 (base case)
- dp[2] = dp[1] + dp[0] = 1 + 1 = 2
- dp[3] = dp[2] + dp[1] = 2 + 1 = 3

So there are 3 ways to climb 3 stairs:
1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
2. 1 step + 2 steps
3. 2 steps + 1 step

## Space Optimization

One advantage of tabulation is that we can often optimize space usage. If we only need the most recent results, we don't need to store the entire table:

```javascript
function climbStairsOptimized(n) {
    if (n <= 1) return 1;
    
    let prev = 1;  // represents dp[0]
    let curr = 1;  // represents dp[1]
    let next;
    
    for (let i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
        next = prev + curr;
        prev = curr;
        curr = next;
    }
    
    return curr;
}

console.log(climbStairsOptimized(5));  // Output: 8
```

This version uses O(1) space instead of O(n), while still producing the correct result.

## Advanced Example: Coin Change Problem

Let's tackle a more complex problem: the **Coin Change** problem.

**Problem Statement**: Given a set of coin denominations and a target amount, find the minimum number of coins needed to make that amount. If it's not possible, return -1.

```javascript
function coinChange(coins, amount) {
    // Initialize dp array with amount+1 (which is greater than any possible result)
    const dp = new Array(amount + 1).fill(amount + 1);
    
    // Base case: 0 coins needed to make amount 0
    dp[0] = 0;
    
    // Fill the table
    for (let i = 1; i <= amount; i++) {
        for (const coin of coins) {
            if (coin <= i) {
                dp[i] = Math.min(dp[i], dp[i - coin] + 1);
            }
        }
    }
    
    // If dp[amount] is still amount+1, it's not possible to make the amount
    return dp[amount] > amount ? -1 : dp[amount];
}

// Example usage
console.log(coinChange([1, 2, 5], 11));  // Output: 3 (5+5+1)
console.log(coinChange([2], 3));  // Output: -1 (not possible)
```

In this implementation:
1. We create a dp array where dp[i] represents the minimum coins needed for amount i
2. We initialize all values to amount+1 (which is greater than any valid answer)
3. The base case dp[0] = 0 (it takes 0 coins to make amount 0)
4. For each amount from 1 to the target, we try each coin and update dp[i] if we find a better solution
5. Finally, we check if dp[amount] has been updated from its initial value

Let's trace through `coinChange([1, 2, 5], 11)`:

| Index (amount) | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 |
|----------------|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|----|----| 
| Initial        | 12| 12| 12| 12| 12| 12| 12| 12| 12| 12| 12 | 12 |
| After process  | 0 | 1 | 1 | 2 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 2 | 3 | 3 | 2  | 3  |

The answer is 3 coins: we can use one 1-coin and two 5-coins.

## 2D Tabulation: Longest Common Subsequence

Some problems require a 2D table. Let's solve the **Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)** problem:

**Problem Statement**: Given two strings, find the length of their longest common subsequence.

```javascript
function longestCommonSubsequence(text1, text2) {
    const m = text1.length;
    const n = text2.length;
    
    // Create a 2D table
    const dp = Array(m + 1).fill().map(() => Array(n + 1).fill(0));
    
    // Fill the dp table
    for (let i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
        for (let j = 1; j <= n; j++) {
            if (text1[i - 1] === text2[j - 1]) {
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1;
            } else {
                dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1]);
            }
        }
    }
    
    return dp[m][n];
}

// Example usage
console.log(longestCommonSubsequence("abcde", "ace"));  // Output: 3
console.log(longestCommonSubsequence("abc", "def"));    // Output: 0
```

In this implementation:
1. We create a 2D table where dp[i][j] represents the length of LCS of text1[0...i-1] and text2[0...j-1]
2. If the characters match, we add 1 to the LCS of the strings without those characters
3. If they don't match, we take the maximum of the LCS when we exclude one character from either string
4. The final answer is in dp[m][n]

## Practical Applications

Tabulation is used in many real-world applications:

1. **Sequence Alignment in Bioinformatics**: To find similarities between DNA, RNA, or protein sequences
2. **Text Similarity**: Used in plagiarism detection and document comparison
3. **Resource Allocation**: In project management and resource planning
4. **Shortest Path Algorithms**: Like Floyd-Warshall for finding shortest paths in graphs
5. **Image Processing**: For various dynamic programming-based image processing algorithms

## Best Practices for Tabulation

1. **Draw the table**: Before coding, sketch the table and manually trace a small example
2. **Identify dependencies**: Make sure you fill the table in an order where all dependencies are computed before they're needed
3. **Space optimization**: See if you can reduce space complexity by only keeping necessary values
4. **Boundary conditions**: Pay special attention to base cases and edge cases
5. **Reconstruct the solution**: If needed, keep track of decisions to reconstruct the actual solution, not just its value

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Incorrect initialization**: Make sure base cases are correctly set
2. **Wrong order of iteration**: The table must be filled so that subproblems are solved before they're needed
3. **Off-by-one errors**: Be careful with array indices, especially when translating from 1-indexed problems to 0-indexed arrays
4. **Incorrect state transitions**: Double-check your recurrence relation
5. **Incomplete problem understanding**: Make sure you fully understand the problem before tabulating

## Summary

The Tabulation technique in Dynamic Programming is a powerful bottom-up approach that:

- Solves problems iteratively by filling in a table
- Starts with base cases and builds up to the final solution
- Often offers better space complexity than memoization
- Requires careful ordering of subproblem solutions
- Works well for problems with overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure

By understanding and applying tabulation properly, you can solve complex problems efficiently and elegantly.

## Exercises

2. Solve the "Knapsack Problem": Given weights and values of n items, put these items in a knapsack of capacity W to get the maximum total value.
3. Implement "Edit Distance": Given two strings, find the minimum number of operations (insert, delete, replace) required to convert one string to another.
4. Solve "Maximum Subarray Sum": Find the contiguous subarray within an array that has the largest sum.
5. Challenge: Implement the "Longest Increasing Subsequence" problem using tabulation, optimizing it to O(n log n) time complexity.
