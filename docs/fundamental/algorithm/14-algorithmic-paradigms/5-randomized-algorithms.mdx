# Randomized Algorithms

## Introduction

Have you ever flipped a coin to make a decision? If so, you've already used a basic form of randomization to solve a problem! Randomized algorithms work on a similar principle—they incorporate random choices into their operation to achieve efficient solutions.

A randomized algorithm is an algorithm that employs a degree of randomness as part of its logic. The algorithm typically uses a random number generator to make certain decisions during execution, which leads to different behaviors on different runs for the same input.

In this tutorial, we'll explore:
- Why randomized algorithms are useful
- Types of randomized algorithms
- How to analyze randomized algorithms
- Practical examples and implementations
- Real-world applications

## Why Use Randomization?

You might wonder: "Why would I want my algorithm to be unpredictable?" There are several compelling reasons:

1. **Simplicity** - Randomized solutions are often simpler than deterministic alternatives
2. **Efficiency** - They can solve problems faster (on average) than the best-known deterministic algorithms
3. **Breaking symmetry** - Random choices help avoid worst-case scenarios that adversarial inputs might cause
4. **Approximating hard problems** - They can provide approximate solutions to problems that are otherwise intractable

## Types of Randomized Algorithms

There are two primary types of randomized algorithms:

### Las Vegas Algorithms

Las Vegas algorithms **always** produce the correct result, but their running time is random (though usually with a bounded expected value).

**Key characteristics:**
- Guaranteed correctness
- Running time varies with each execution
- May occasionally take longer than expected, but will always terminate with the correct answer

### Monte Carlo Algorithms

Monte Carlo algorithms have **fixed** running times but might produce incorrect results with some small probability.

**Key characteristics:**
- Fixed running time
- May occasionally give wrong answers
- Error probability can typically be reduced by running the algorithm multiple times

## Analyzing Randomized Algorithms

When analyzing randomized algorithms, we need different tools than those used for deterministic algorithms:

1. **Expected running time** - The average running time over all possible random choices
2. **Probability of correctness** - The likelihood that the algorithm produces the correct output
3. **Randomized complexity classes** - Special complexity classes like RP (Randomized Polynomial time) and ZPP (Zero-error Probabilistic Polynomial time)

## Practical Examples

Let's look at some common randomized algorithms with code examples.

### Example 1: Randomized QuickSort

QuickSort's performance depends heavily on pivot selection. Using a random pivot makes the algorithm resistant to adversarial inputs.

```python
import random

def randomized_quicksort(arr, start=0, end=None):
    if end is None:
        end = len(arr) - 1
    
    if start < end:
        # Choose a random pivot
        pivot_idx = random.randint(start, end)
        # Swap the pivot with the first element
        arr[start], arr[pivot_idx] = arr[pivot_idx], arr[start]
        
        # Partition the array around the pivot
        pivot = partition(arr, start, end)
        
        # Recursively sort sub-arrays
        randomized_quicksort(arr, start, pivot - 1)
        randomized_quicksort(arr, pivot + 1, end)
    
    return arr

def partition(arr, start, end):
    pivot_value = arr[start]
    i = start + 1
    
    for j in range(start + 1, end + 1):
        if arr[j] < pivot_value:
            arr[i], arr[j] = arr[j], arr[i]
            i += 1
    
    # Put pivot in its final place
    arr[start], arr[i-1] = arr[i-1], arr[start]
    return i - 1

# Example usage
numbers = [10, 7, 8, 9, 1, 5]
print("Original array:", numbers)
sorted_numbers = randomized_quicksort(numbers.copy())
print("Sorted array:", sorted_numbers)
```

**Output:**
```
Original array: [10, 7, 8, 9, 1, 5]
Sorted array: [1, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10]
```

The randomized version of QuickSort has an expected time complexity of O(n log n), regardless of the input arrangement, and is much less likely to encounter the worst-case O(n²) scenario that affects the deterministic version with fixed pivot selection.

### Example 2: Randomized Primality Testing (Miller-Rabin)

Determining if a number is prime is fundamental in cryptography. The Miller-Rabin test is a probabilistic algorithm that can determine whether a number is probably prime.

```python
import random

def miller_rabin(n, k=40):
    """
    Miller-Rabin primality test.
    
    n: number to test
    k: number of tests to perform
    
    Returns: True if n is probably prime, False if it's definitely composite
    """
    if n == 2 or n == 3:
        return True
    if n <= 1 or n % 2 == 0:
        return False
    
    # Write n as 2^r * d + 1
    r, d = 0, n - 1
    while d % 2 == 0:
        r += 1
        d //= 2
    
    # Witness loop
    for _ in range(k):
        a = random.randint(2, n - 2)
        x = pow(a, d, n)
        if x == 1 or x == n - 1:
            continue
        
        for _ in range(r - 1):
            x = pow(x, 2, n)
            if x == n - 1:
                break
        else:
            return False  # Definitely composite
    
    return True  # Probably prime

# Example usage
test_numbers = [7, 15, 17, 1000003]
for num in test_numbers:
    result = "probably prime" if miller_rabin(num) else "composite"
    print(f"{num} is {result}")
```

**Output:**
```
7 is probably prime
15 is composite
17 is probably prime
1000003 is probably prime
```

The Miller-Rabin test is a Monte Carlo algorithm. It always correctly identifies composite numbers, but it might incorrectly identify a composite number as prime. However, the probability of error decreases exponentially with each additional test (parameter `k`).

### Example 3: Reservoir Sampling

Imagine you need to select a random sample of k items from a stream of data of unknown size. Reservoir sampling solves this elegantly:

```python
import random

def reservoir_sampling(stream, k):
    """
    Select k random items from a stream of unknown size.
    
    stream: an iterable of items
    k: number of items to select
    
    Returns: list of k randomly selected items
    """
    reservoir = []
    count = 0
    
    for item in stream:
        count += 1
        
        # Fill the reservoir until we have k elements
        if len(reservoir) < k:
            reservoir.append(item)
        else:
            # Replace elements with decreasing probability
            j = random.randint(0, count - 1)
            if j < k:
                reservoir[j] = item
    
    return reservoir

# Example usage: selecting 3 random numbers from a stream
def number_stream():
    """Generator function simulating a data stream"""
    for i in range(1, 10001):  # Large stream of numbers
        yield i

sample = reservoir_sampling(number_stream(), 3)
print(f"Random sample of 3 items from stream: {sample}")
```

**Output:**
```
Random sample of 3 items from stream: [3218, 6104, 9872]
```
(The actual values will vary each time you run the algorithm.)

Reservoir sampling is particularly useful for big data applications when you can't load the entire dataset into memory or when the data arrives in a streaming fashion.

## Real-World Applications of Randomized Algorithms

Randomized algorithms are used extensively in various fields:

### 1. Cryptography

Many cryptographic protocols rely on randomness for security:
- Key generation
- Salt values for password hashing
- Nonce values in communication protocols

### 2. Machine Learning

- Random initialization of neural network weights
- Stochastic gradient descent
- Random forests and bootstrapping in ensemble methods

### 3. Database Systems

- Random sampling for query optimization
- Consistent hashing in distributed databases

### 4. Network Protocols

- Random backoff in Ethernet's CSMA/CD protocol
- Randomized routing to distribute network load

### 5. Simulation and Modeling

Let's look at a simple Monte Carlo simulation example for estimating π:

```python
import random
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def estimate_pi(num_points):
    """
    Estimate π using Monte Carlo simulation.
    
    We count points that fall inside a quarter circle with radius 1,
    placed inside a 1×1 square.
    """
    points_inside_circle = 0
    
    x_inside, y_inside = [], []  # Points inside the circle
    x_outside, y_outside = [], []  # Points outside the circle
    
    for _ in range(num_points):
        # Generate random point in 1×1 square
        x = random.random()
        y = random.random()
        
        # Check if point is inside quarter circle
        if x*x + y*y <= 1:
            points_inside_circle += 1
            x_inside.append(x)
            y_inside.append(y)
        else:
            x_outside.append(x)
            y_outside.append(y)
    
    # π ≈ 4 × (points inside circle) / (total points)
    pi_estimate = 4 * points_inside_circle / num_points
    
    # Optional: visualization
    """
    plt.figure(figsize=(6, 6))
    plt.scatter(x_inside, y_inside, color='blue', s=1)
    plt.scatter(x_outside, y_outside, color='red', s=1)
    plt.axis('equal')
    plt.title(f'π estimate: {pi_estimate:.6f}')
    plt.show()
    """
    
    return pi_estimate

# Example usage
estimates = []
trials = [100, 1000, 10000, 100000]

for n in trials:
    pi_estimate = estimate_pi(n)
    estimates.append(pi_estimate)
    print(f"With {n} points: π ≈ {pi_estimate:.6f}")

print(f"Actual π: 3.141593...")
```

**Output:**
```
With 100 points: π ≈ 3.080000
With 1000 points: π ≈ 3.144000
With 10000 points: π ≈ 3.146400
With 100000 points: π ≈ 3.139240
Actual π: 3.141593...
```

This simulation demonstrates how increasing the number of random samples improves our estimate's accuracy, showcasing the power of randomization in numerical computations.

## Randomization as a Problem-Solving Strategy

When approaching a new problem, consider whether randomization might help:

1. **When deterministic algorithms are too slow**: Randomization can often break through complexity barriers
2. **When stuck in local optima**: Random restarts in optimization algorithms
3. **When average-case performance matters more than worst-case**: Trading guaranteed bounds for better typical performance
4. **When needing to break symmetry**: In distributed systems and game theory
5. **When exact answers aren't required**: Approximation algorithms can save significant computational resources

## Summary

Randomized algorithms provide a powerful approach to solving complex problems by leveraging the properties of randomness. We've explored:

- The two main types: Las Vegas (always correct, random runtime) and Monte Carlo (fixed runtime, probabilistically correct)
- How to analyze these algorithms using probability and expectation
- Practical examples including quicksort, primality testing, and sampling
- Real-world applications across numerous domains

The strategic introduction of randomness often leads to algorithms that are simpler, faster, and more robust against adversarial inputs than their deterministic counterparts. As you develop your algorithmic toolkit, randomization should be one of your core strategies for tackling challenging problems.

## Exercises

1. Modify the randomized QuickSort to use the median of three random elements as the pivot. How does this affect performance?
2. Implement a randomized algorithm to find the median of an array in expected O(n) time.
3. Use the Monte Carlo method to estimate the area of an irregular shape of your choice.
4. Implement a Las Vegas algorithm for generating a random permutation of n elements.
5. Research and implement a randomized algorithm for the Min-Cut problem in graphs.
