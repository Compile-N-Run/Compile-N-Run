- [Linear Search](./0-linear-search.mdx)
- [Binary Search](./1-binary-search.mdx)
- [Ternary Search](./2-ternary-search.mdx)
- [Jump Search](./3-jump-search.mdx)
- [Interpolation Search](./4-interpolation-search.mdx)
- [Exponential Search](./5-exponential-search.mdx)
- [Substring Search](./6-substring-search.mdx)
- [Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) Algorithm](./7-kmp-algorithm.mdx)
- [Rabin-Karp Algorithm](./8-rabin-karp-algorithm.mdx)
- [Z Algorithm](./9-z-algorithm.mdx)

Have fun coding!
