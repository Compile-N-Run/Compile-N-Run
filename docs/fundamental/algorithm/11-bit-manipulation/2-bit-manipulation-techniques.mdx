# Bit Manipulation Techniques

## Introduction

Bit manipulation involves performing operations at the individual bit level of a binary number. It's a fundamental skill in computer programming that allows for efficient implementation of algorithms and can significantly optimize code performance. While it might seem intimidating at first, mastering bit manipulation techniques can give you a deeper understanding of how computers work and provide powerful tools for solving complex problems.

In this tutorial, we'll explore various bit manipulation techniques, from basic operations to more advanced applications. By the end, you'll have a solid foundation to leverage these techniques in your own programs.

## Understanding Binary and Bits

Before diving into bit manipulation techniques, let's ensure we understand the fundamentals of binary representation.

### Binary Numbers

Computers store all data in binary format (0s and 1s). Each digit in a binary number is called a bit, and a group of 8 bits forms a byte.

For example, the decimal number 42 is represented in binary as `101010`:

```
Decimal: 42
Binary:  101010
```

In programming languages, binary literals are often prefixed with `0b`:

```c
int num = 0b101010;  // equals 42 in decimal
```

### Bit Positions

When discussing bit manipulation, we often reference specific bit positions. By convention, we number bits from right to left, starting from 0:

```
Bit position:  5 4 3 2 1 0
Binary value:  1 0 1 0 1 0
```

## Basic Bit Manipulation Operations

Let's now explore the fundamental operations used in bit manipulation.

### Bitwise Operators

Most programming languages provide the following bitwise operators:

| Operator | Name          | Description                               |
|----------|---------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `&`      | AND           | Sets each bit to 1 if both bits are 1     |
| `\|`     | OR            | Sets each bit to 1 if at least one bit is 1 |
| `^`      | XOR           | Sets each bit to 1 if exactly one bit is 1 |
| `~`      | NOT           | Inverts all the bits                      |
| `<<`     | Left Shift    | Shifts bits left by a specified number    |
| `>>`     | Right Shift   | Shifts bits right by a specified number   |

### Examples of Basic Operations

Let's see how these operators work with simple examples:

```java
// Using decimal values 5 (101 in binary) and 3 (011 in binary)
int a = 5;  // 101 in binary
int b = 3;  // 011 in binary

// Bitwise AND
int andResult = a & b;  // 001 = 1 in decimal

// Bitwise OR
int orResult = a | b;   // 111 = 7 in decimal

// Bitwise XOR
int xorResult = a ^ b;  // 110 = 6 in decimal

// Bitwise NOT (depends on integer size, assuming 8-bit)
int notA = ~a;  // 11111010 = -6 in decimal (using 2's complement)

// Left Shift
int leftShift = a << 1;  // 1010 = 10 in decimal

// Right Shift
int rightShift = a >> 1;  // 010 = 2 in decimal

System.out.println("a & b = " + andResult);
System.out.println("a | b = " + orResult);
System.out.println("a ^ b = " + xorResult);
System.out.println("~a = " + notA);
System.out.println("a << 1 = " + leftShift);
System.out.println("a >> 1 = " + rightShift);
```

Output:
```
a & b = 1
a | b = 7
a ^ b = 6
~a = -6
a << 1 = 10
a >> 1 = 2
```

## Common Bit Manipulation Techniques

Now that we understand the basic operations, let's explore some common techniques used in programming.

### 1. Check if a bit is set (1) at a specific position

To check if the bit at position `pos` is set in number `n`:

```cpp
bool isBitSet(int n, int pos) {
    return (n & (1 << pos)) != 0;
}

// Example usage
int num = 42;  // 101010 in binary
for (int i = 0; i < 6; i++) {
    if (isBitSet(num, i)) {
        cout << "Bit at position " << i << " is set" << endl;
    } else {
        cout << "Bit at position " << i << " is not set" << endl;
    }
}
```

Output:
```
Bit at position 0 is not set
Bit at position 1 is set
Bit at position 2 is not set
Bit at position 3 is set
Bit at position 4 is not set
Bit at position 5 is set
```

### 2. Set a bit at a specific position

To set the bit at position `pos` in number `n`:

```cpp
int setBit(int n, int pos) {
    return n | (1 << pos);
}

// Example usage
int num = 36;  // 100100 in binary
int result = setBit(num, 3);
cout << "Original: " << num << " (" << bitset<6>(num) << ")" << endl;
cout << "After setting bit 3: " << result << " (" << bitset<6>(result) << ")" << endl;
```

Output:
```
Original: 36 (100100)
After setting bit 3: 44 (101100)
```

### 3. Clear a bit at a specific position

To clear (set to 0) the bit at position `pos` in number `n`:

```cpp
int clearBit(int n, int pos) {
    return n & ~(1 << pos);
}

// Example usage
int num = 42;  // 101010 in binary
int result = clearBit(num, 1);
cout << "Original: " << num << " (" << bitset<6>(num) << ")" << endl;
cout << "After clearing bit 1: " << result << " (" << bitset<6>(result) << ")" << endl;
```

Output:
```
Original: 42 (101010)
After clearing bit 1: 40 (101000)
```

### 4. Toggle a bit at a specific position

To toggle (flip) the bit at position `pos` in number `n`:

```cpp
int toggleBit(int n, int pos) {
    return n ^ (1 << pos);
}

// Example usage
int num = 42;  // 101010 in binary
int result = toggleBit(num, 2);
cout << "Original: " << num << " (" << bitset<6>(num) << ")" << endl;
cout << "After toggling bit 2: " << result << " (" << bitset<6>(result) << ")" << endl;
```

Output:
```
Original: 42 (101010)
After toggling bit 2: 46 (101110)
```

### 5. Count the number of set bits (1s)

To count how many bits are set to 1 in number `n`:

```cpp
int countSetBits(int n) {
    int count = 0;
    while (n) {
        count += n & 1;
        n >>= 1;
    }
    return count;
}

// Example usage
int num = 42;  // 101010 in binary
cout << "Number of set bits in " << num << ": " << countSetBits(num) << endl;
```

Output:
```
Number of set bits in 42: 3
```

A more efficient method is Brian Kernighan's algorithm:

```cpp
int countSetBitsEfficient(int n) {
    int count = 0;
    while (n) {
        n &= (n - 1);
        count++;
    }
    return count;
}
```

### 6. Check if a number is a power of 2

A number that's a power of 2 has exactly one bit set to 1. We can check this with:

```cpp
bool isPowerOfTwo(int n) {
    return n > 0 && (n & (n - 1)) == 0;
}

// Example usage
cout << "Is 16 a power of 2? " << (isPowerOfTwo(16) ? "Yes" : "No") << endl;
cout << "Is 18 a power of 2? " << (isPowerOfTwo(18) ? "Yes" : "No") << endl;
```

Output:
```
Is 16 a power of 2? Yes
Is 18 a power of 2? No
```

## Advanced Techniques

Let's explore some more advanced bit manipulation techniques.

### 1. XOR Properties for Swapping Variables

XOR can be used to swap two variables without using a temporary variable:

```cpp
void swapUsingXOR(int &a, int &b) {
    a = a ^ b;
    b = a ^ b;  // Now b has the original value of a
    a = a ^ b;  // Now a has the original value of b
}

// Example usage
int x = 10, y = 20;
cout << "Before swap: x = " << x << ", y = " << y << endl;
swapUsingXOR(x, y);
cout << "After swap: x = " << x << ", y = " << y << endl;
```

Output:
```
Before swap: x = 10, y = 20
After swap: x = 20, y = 10
```

### 2. Finding the Missing Number

Given an array containing n distinct numbers taken from 0, 1, 2, ..., n, find the missing one:

```cpp
int findMissing(vector<int>& nums) {
    int result = nums.size();
    for(int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
        result ^= i ^ nums[i];
    }
    return result;
}

// Example usage
vector<int> arr = {0, 1, 3, 4};
cout << "Missing number: " << findMissing(arr) << endl;
```

Output:
```
Missing number: 2
```

### 3. Finding the Single Number

Given a non-empty array where every element appears twice except for one, find that single one:

```cpp
int findSingle(vector<int>& nums) {
    int result = 0;
    for(int num : nums) {
        result ^= num;
    }
    return result;
}

// Example usage
vector<int> arr = {4, 1, 2, 1, 2};
cout << "Single number: " << findSingle(arr) << endl;
```

Output:
```
Single number: 4
```

### 4. Using Bit Masks

Bit masks are patterns used to manipulate specific bits:

```cpp
// Create a mask with bits from positions 'start' to 'end' set to 1
int createMask(int start, int end) {
    int mask = 0;
    for(int i = start; i <= end; i++) {
        mask |= (1 << i);
    }
    return mask;
}

// Extract a range of bits from a number
int extractBits(int num, int start, int end) {
    int mask = createMask(start, end);
    return (num & mask) >> start;
}

// Example usage
int num = 171;  // 10101011 in binary
int extracted = extractBits(num, 2, 5);
cout << "Extracted bits from positions 2-5: " << extracted << " (" << bitset<4>(extracted) << ")" << endl;
```

Output:
```
Extracted bits from positions 2-5: 10 (1010)
```

## Real-world Applications

Bit manipulation is not just a theoretical concept; it has many practical applications:

### 1. Permissions and Flags

Operating systems and file systems use bit flags to represent permissions:

```cpp
// Define permission flags
const int READ = 4;    // 100 in binary
const int WRITE = 2;   // 010 in binary
const int EXECUTE = 1; // 001 in binary

// Set permissions
int setPermissions(int currentPermissions, int permissionsToAdd) {
    return currentPermissions | permissionsToAdd;
}

// Check if a permission is set
bool hasPermission(int permissions, int permissionToCheck) {
    return (permissions & permissionToCheck) == permissionToCheck;
}

// Example: Unix-like file permissions
int userPermissions = 0;
userPermissions = setPermissions(userPermissions, READ | WRITE);

cout << "User can read: " << (hasPermission(userPermissions, READ) ? "Yes" : "No") << endl;
cout << "User can write: " << (hasPermission(userPermissions, WRITE) ? "Yes" : "No") << endl;
cout << "User can execute: " << (hasPermission(userPermissions, EXECUTE) ? "Yes" : "No") << endl;
```

Output:
```
User can read: Yes
User can write: Yes
User can execute: No
```

### 2. Efficient Storage with Bit Fields

When memory is limited, bit fields can efficiently store boolean flags:

```cpp
// Using a single byte to store 8 boolean values
class CompactFlags {
private:
    uint8_t flags;
public:
    CompactFlags() : flags(0) {}
    
    void setFlag(int position, bool value) {
        if(value)
            flags |= (1 << position);
        else
            flags &= ~(1 << position);
    }
    
    bool getFlag(int position) {
        return (flags & (1 << position)) != 0;
    }
};

// Example usage
CompactFlags settings;
settings.setFlag(0, true);   // Enable first setting
settings.setFlag(2, true);   // Enable third setting

cout << "Setting 0: " << (settings.getFlag(0) ? "On" : "Off") << endl;
cout << "Setting 1: " << (settings.getFlag(1) ? "On" : "Off") << endl;
cout << "Setting 2: " << (settings.getFlag(2) ? "On" : "Off") << endl;
```

Output:
```
Setting 0: On
Setting 1: Off
Setting 2: On
```

### 3. RGB Color Manipulation

Colors in computer graphics are often represented as 32-bit integers (RGBA):

```javascript
function extractRGB(colorInt) {
  const r = (colorInt >> 16) & 0xFF;
  const g = (colorInt >> 8) & 0xFF;
  const b = colorInt & 0xFF;
  return [r, g, b];
}

function createRGB(r, g, b) {
  return ((r & 0xFF) << 16) | 
         ((g & 0xFF) << 8) | 
         (b & 0xFF);
}

// Example usage
const color = 0x00FF00;  // Green
const [r, g, b] = extractRGB(color);
console.log(`Red: ${r}, Green: ${g}, Blue: ${b}`);

const newColor = createRGB(255, 0, 255);  // Purple
console.log(`New color: 0x${newColor.toString(16).padStart(6, '0')}`);
```

Output:
```
Red: 0, Green: 255, Blue: 0
New color: 0xff00ff
```

## Performance Considerations

Bit manipulation operations are typically very fast as they map directly to CPU instructions. However, code readability is also important. Here are some tips:

1. **Use comments**: Bit manipulation code can be hard to understand at a glance
2. **Use named constants**: Define bit masks with meaningful names
3. **Consider library functions**: Many languages provide built-in functions for common bit operations
4. **Measure performance**: Only optimize if it's actually a bottleneck

## Summary

Bit manipulation techniques provide powerful tools for efficient programming. In this tutorial, we've covered:

- Basic bitwise operations (AND, OR, XOR, NOT, shifts)
- Common bit manipulation techniques (checking, setting, clearing bits)
- Advanced techniques (variable swapping, finding unique elements)
- Real-world applications (permissions, compact storage, color manipulation)

With these techniques in your toolkit, you'll be able to write more efficient code and solve problems in ways that might not be immediately obvious with standard arithmetic operations.

## Exercises

To strengthen your understanding, try these exercises:

1. Write a function to check if an integer is odd or even using bit manipulation.
2. Implement a function to reverse the bits of a 32-bit unsigned integer.
3. Write a function to find the position of the rightmost set bit in an integer.
4. Given an array where all numbers appear three times except one, find the single number.
5. Implement a function to count the number of bits to change to convert integer A to integer B.
