# Bit Masking

## Introduction

Bit masking is a powerful technique in computer programming that allows you to manipulate individual bits within a binary representation of data. Think of a bit mask as a template that shows which bits you want to work with in a binary number. By using bitwise operators along with carefully crafted masks, you can efficiently set, clear, toggle, or check the status of specific bits.

Bit masking is widely used in various applications such as:

- Managing settings and flags in configuration systems
- Implementing permissions and access control
- Optimizing memory usage for data structures
- Enhancing performance in algorithm implementations
- Hardware-level programming and device control

In this tutorial, we'll explore the fundamentals of bit masking and learn how to apply these techniques in practical programming scenarios.

## Understanding Bit Masks

A bit mask is a binary pattern designed to retain or manipulate specific bits when used with bitwise operations. The basic idea is simple:

- A bit value of `1` in the mask indicates a bit position of interest
- A bit value of `0` in the mask indicates a bit position to be ignored

For example, the binary number `00001010` (decimal 10) has bits set at positions 1 and 3 (counting from right, zero-indexed). If we want to specifically work with these positions, we would use the mask `00001010`.

## Basic Bit Masking Operations

### 1. Setting Bits (OR operation)

To set a specific bit to 1, use the bitwise OR (`|`) operation with a mask that has a 1 in the position you want to set.

```cpp
// Setting the 3rd bit (position 2, zero-indexed)
int num = 10;          // 00001010 in binary
int mask = (1 << 2);   // 00000100 in binary (1 shifted left by 2 positions)
int result = num | mask; // 00001110 (decimal 14)

printf("Original: %d (binary: %s)\n", num, "00001010");
printf("Mask: %d (binary: %s)\n", mask, "00000100");
printf("After setting bit 2: %d (binary: %s)\n", result, "00001110");
```

**Output:**
```
Original: 10 (binary: 00001010)
Mask: 4 (binary: 00000100)
After setting bit 2: 14 (binary: 00001110)
```

### 2. Clearing Bits (AND operation)

To clear a specific bit (set it to 0), use the bitwise AND (`&`) operation with a mask that has a 0 in the position you want to clear and 1s elsewhere.

```cpp
// Clearing the 1st bit (position 0, zero-indexed)
int num = 10;            // 00001010 in binary
int mask = ~(1 << 0);    // 11111110 in binary (complement of 1 shifted left by 0)
int result = num & mask; // 00001010 (decimal 10, unchanged since bit 0 was already 0)

// Let's try clearing bit 1 instead (which is set)
mask = ~(1 << 1);        // 11111101 in binary
result = num & mask;     // 00001000 (decimal 8)

printf("Original: %d (binary: %s)\n", num, "00001010");
printf("Mask for bit 1: %d (binary: %s)\n", mask, "11111101");
printf("After clearing bit 1: %d (binary: %s)\n", result, "00001000");
```

**Output:**
```
Original: 10 (binary: 00001010)
Mask for bit 1: -3 (binary: 11111101)
After clearing bit 1: 8 (binary: 00001000)
```

### 3. Toggling Bits (XOR operation)

To toggle a specific bit (flip 0 to 1 or 1 to 0), use the bitwise XOR (`^`) operation with a mask that has a 1 in the position you want to toggle.

```cpp
// Toggling the 3rd bit (position 2, zero-indexed)
int num = 10;          // 00001010 in binary
int mask = (1 << 2);   // 00000100 in binary
int result = num ^ mask; // 00001110 (decimal 14)

printf("Original: %d (binary: %s)\n", num, "00001010");
printf("After toggling bit 2: %d (binary: %s)\n", result, "00001110");

// Toggle it again
result = result ^ mask;  // 00001010 (decimal 10)
printf("After toggling bit 2 again: %d (binary: %s)\n", result, "00001010");
```

**Output:**
```
Original: 10 (binary: 00001010)
After toggling bit 2: 14 (binary: 00001110)
After toggling bit 2 again: 10 (binary: 00001010)
```

### 4. Checking Bits (AND operation)

To check if a specific bit is set to 1, use the bitwise AND operation with a mask that has a 1 in the position you want to check.

```cpp
// Checking if the 1st bit (position 0, zero-indexed) is set
int num = 10;          // 00001010 in binary
int mask = (1 << 0);   // 00000001 in binary
bool isBitSet = (num & mask) != 0; // false, as bit 0 is 0

printf("Original: %d (binary: %s)\n", num, "00001010");
printf("Is bit 0 set? %s\n", isBitSet ? "Yes" : "No");

// Check if bit 1 is set
mask = (1 << 1);       // 00000010 in binary
isBitSet = (num & mask) != 0; // true, as bit 1 is 1
printf("Is bit 1 set? %s\n", isBitSet ? "Yes" : "No");
```

**Output:**
```
Original: 10 (binary: 00001010)
Is bit 0 set? No
Is bit 1 set? Yes
```

## Multiple Bit Operations

You can also perform operations on multiple bits at once by creating more complex masks.

### Setting Multiple Bits

```cpp
// Setting bits 1 and 3 (positions 0 and 2, zero-indexed)
int num = 0;            // 00000000 in binary
int mask = (1 << 0) | (1 << 2); // 00000101 in binary
int result = num | mask; // 00000101 (decimal 5)

printf("Original: %d (binary: %s)\n", num, "00000000");
printf("After setting bits 0 and 2: %d (binary: %s)\n", result, "00000101");
```

**Output:**
```
Original: 0 (binary: 00000000)
After setting bits 0 and 2: 5 (binary: 00000101)
```

### Creating Complex Masks

For ranges of bits, you can create masks with consecutive 1s:

```cpp
// Create a mask for the lower 4 bits (0-3)
int mask = (1 << 4) - 1; // 00001111 in binary (decimal 15)

printf("Mask for lower 4 bits: %d (binary: %s)\n", mask, "00001111");

// Extract the lower 4 bits from a number
int num = 173;  // 10101101 in binary
int result = num & mask; // 00001101 (decimal 13)

printf("Original: %d (binary: %s)\n", num, "10101101");
printf("Lower 4 bits: %d (binary: %s)\n", result, "00001101");
```

**Output:**
```
Mask for lower 4 bits: 15 (binary: 00001111)
Original: 173 (binary: 10101101)
Lower 4 bits: 13 (binary: 00001101)
```

## Practical Applications of Bit Masking

### 1. Storing Boolean Flags Efficiently

One common use of bit masking is to store multiple boolean flags in a single integer, which can save memory when you need to track many on/off states.

```cpp
// Using bit flags for file permissions (similar to Unix)
// Read (4), Write (2), Execute (1)
const int READ = 1 << 2;    // 00000100 (4)
const int WRITE = 1 << 1;   // 00000010 (2)
const int EXECUTE = 1 << 0; // 00000001 (1)

// Create permissions for a file
int permissions = 0;

// Give read and write permissions
permissions |= READ | WRITE; // 00000110 (6)

printf("Permissions: %d\n", permissions);
printf("Has read permission: %s\n", (permissions & READ) ? "Yes" : "No");
printf("Has write permission: %s\n", (permissions & WRITE) ? "Yes" : "No");
printf("Has execute permission: %s\n", (permissions & EXECUTE) ? "Yes" : "No");

// Add execute permission
permissions |= EXECUTE; // 00000111 (7)
printf("\nAfter adding execute permission: %d\n", permissions);
printf("Has execute permission: %s\n", (permissions & EXECUTE) ? "Yes" : "No");

// Remove write permission
permissions &= ~WRITE; // 00000101 (5)
printf("\nAfter removing write permission: %d\n", permissions);
printf("Has write permission: %s\n", (permissions & WRITE) ? "Yes" : "No");
```

**Output:**
```
Permissions: 6
Has read permission: Yes
Has write permission: Yes
Has execute permission: No

After adding execute permission: 7
Has execute permission: Yes

After removing write permission: 5
Has write permission: No
```

### 2. Implementing a Simple Set

Bit masking can be used to implement a set of small integers efficiently:

```cpp
// Using a 32-bit integer to represent a set of numbers 0-31
int set = 0;

// Add elements to the set: 5, 12, 25
set |= (1 << 5) | (1 << 12) | (1 << 25);

printf("Set elements: ");
for (int i = 0; i < 32; i++) {
    if (set & (1 << i)) {
        printf("%d ", i);
    }
}
printf("\n");

// Check if 12 is in the set
bool contains12 = (set & (1 << 12)) != 0;
printf("Set contains 12: %s\n", contains12 ? "Yes" : "No");

// Remove 12 from the set
set &= ~(1 << 12);
printf("After removing 12, set contains 12: %s\n", (set & (1 << 12)) ? "Yes" : "No");

// Count elements in the set
int count = 0;
for (int i = 0; i < 32; i++) {
    if (set & (1 << i)) {
        count++;
    }
}
printf("Number of elements in the set: %d\n", count);
```

**Output:**
```
Set elements: 5 12 25 
Set contains 12: Yes
After removing 12, set contains 12: No
Number of elements in the set: 2
```

### 3. Optimizing Game State

In game development, bit masking is often used to track states of objects or characters:

```cpp
// Game character status flags
const int STATUS_POISONED  = 1 << 0;
const int STATUS_FROZEN    = 1 << 1;
const int STATUS_BURNING   = 1 << 2;
const int STATUS_STUNNED   = 1 << 3;
const int STATUS_INVISIBLE = 1 << 4;

// Initialize character status
int characterStatus = 0;

// Character gets poisoned and stunned
characterStatus |= STATUS_POISONED | STATUS_STUNNED;

printf("Character status: %d\n", characterStatus);
printf("Is poisoned: %s\n", (characterStatus & STATUS_POISONED) ? "Yes" : "No");
printf("Is frozen: %s\n", (characterStatus & STATUS_FROZEN) ? "Yes" : "No");
printf("Is stunned: %s\n", (characterStatus & STATUS_STUNNED) ? "Yes" : "No");

// Character takes an antidote for poison
characterStatus &= ~STATUS_POISONED;
printf("\nAfter taking antidote, is poisoned: %s\n", (characterStatus & STATUS_POISONED) ? "Yes" : "No");

// Toggle invisibility
characterStatus ^= STATUS_INVISIBLE;
printf("Is invisible: %s\n", (characterStatus & STATUS_INVISIBLE) ? "Yes" : "No");

// Toggle again
characterStatus ^= STATUS_INVISIBLE;
printf("After toggling again, is invisible: %s\n", (characterStatus & STATUS_INVISIBLE) ? "Yes" : "No");
```

**Output:**
```
Character status: 9
Is poisoned: Yes
Is frozen: No
Is stunned: Yes

After taking antidote, is poisoned: No
Is invisible: Yes
After toggling again, is invisible: No
```

## Performance Considerations

Bit manipulation operations are extremely fast because they're directly supported by CPU hardware. However, there are some things to keep in mind:

1. **Readability** - Bit manipulation code can be harder to read and maintain, so consider adding thorough comments.
2. **Platform Dependence** - Be aware of integer sizes on different platforms.
3. **Optimization** - Modern compilers often optimize bit manipulation operations very well.

Here's a simple benchmark comparing bit masking to an array of booleans:

```cpp
// Comparing performance of bit masking vs. boolean array
// This is just a conceptual comparison - actual implementation would need timing code

// With bit masking (storing 32 flags in one integer)
int flags = 0;
// Set flag 5
flags |= (1 << 5);
// Check flag 5
bool isSet = (flags & (1 << 5)) != 0;
// Clear flag 5
flags &= ~(1 << 5);

// Equivalent with boolean array
bool boolFlags[32] = {false};
// Set flag 5
boolFlags[5] = true;
// Check flag 5
isSet = boolFlags[5];
// Clear flag 5
boolFlags[5] = false;

// The bit masking version uses 4 bytes for 32 flags (on 32-bit systems)
// The boolean array uses 32 bytes for 32 flags
printf("Space efficiency: bit mask uses %d%% of the space compared to boolean array\n", 
       (sizeof(int) * 100) / (sizeof(bool) * 32));
```

**Output:**
```
Space efficiency: bit mask uses 12% of the space compared to boolean array
```

## Common Bit Mask Patterns

Here are some commonly used bit mask patterns:

```cpp
// Common bit mask patterns
int n = 42; // Example number

// 1. Get the least significant bit (LSB)
int lsb = n & 1;
printf("Least significant bit of %d: %d\n", n, lsb);

// 2. Check if a number is odd or even
bool isOdd = n & 1;
printf("%d is %s\n", n, isOdd ? "odd" : "even");

// 3. Clear all bits except the least significant n bits
int value = 0xABCD; // Example value
int n_bits = 8;
int mask = (1 << n_bits) - 1;
int result = value & mask; // Keeps only the lower 8 bits
printf("Value: 0x%X, After masking to %d bits: 0x%X\n", value, n_bits, result);

// 4. Get the rightmost set bit
int rightmost_set = n & -n;
printf("Rightmost set bit of %d: 0x%X\n", n, rightmost_set);

// 5. Clear the rightmost set bit
int without_rightmost = n & (n - 1);
printf("%d without rightmost set bit: %d\n", n, without_rightmost);

// 6. Check if number is a power of 2
bool isPowerOf2 = (n & (n - 1)) == 0 && n > 0;
printf("Is %d a power of 2? %s\n", n, isPowerOf2 ? "Yes" : "No");
printf("Is %d a power of 2? %s\n", 64, ((64 & (64 - 1)) == 0 && 64 > 0) ? "Yes" : "No");
```

**Output:**
```
Least significant bit of 42: 0
42 is even
Value: 0xABCD, After masking to 8 bits: 0xCD
Rightmost set bit of 42: 0x2
42 without rightmost set bit: 40
Is 42 a power of 2? No
Is 64 a power of 2? Yes
```
