# Networks Transmission Media

## Introduction

The physical layer is the foundation of any network, and transmission media are the channels through which data travels between devices. Think of transmission media as the highways and roads that transport digital information from one place to another. The choice of transmission medium significantly impacts a network's speed, distance capabilities, security, and cost.

In this guide, we'll explore the various types of transmission media, their characteristics, and how they're used in real-world applications. Understanding these fundamentals is crucial whether you're setting up a home network or planning an enterprise infrastructure.

## Types of Transmission Media

Transmission media can be broadly categorized into two types:

1. **Guided Media** (Wired): Physical pathways that guide the data signals along a specific route
2. **Unguided Media** (Wireless): Transmission through air or space without physical pathways

Let's examine each type in detail.
