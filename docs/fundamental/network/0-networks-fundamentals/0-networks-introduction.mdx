# Networks Introduction

## What is a Computer Network?

A computer network is a collection of computing devices connected together to share resources and communicate with each other. These resources can include data, software, hardware (like printers), and services (like internet access).

Think of a network like a city's road system - it allows traffic (data) to flow between different locations (computers) following certain rules (protocols) to ensure everything runs smoothly.

## Why Do We Need Networks?

Networks have transformed how we use computers. Before networks, computers were isolated machines. Now, they're interconnected systems enabling:

- **Resource sharing**: Use printers, storage, and software from anywhere
- **Communication**: Email, chat, video calls
- **Collaboration**: Multiple people working on the same document
- **Data access**: Retrieve information from anywhere in the world
- **Cost efficiency**: Share expensive resources rather than duplicating them

## Network Components

### 1. Hardware Components

Networks require specific hardware to function:

- **Nodes**: End devices like computers, smartphones, printers, servers
- **Network Interface Cards (NICs)**: Hardware allowing devices to connect to networks
- **Transmission Media**: The physical paths data travels through:
  - **Wired**: Copper cables, fiber optic
  - **Wireless**: Radio waves, microwaves
- **Connecting Devices**:
  - **Hubs**: Simple devices that forward data to all connected devices
  - **Switches**: Intelligent devices that forward data only to the intended recipient
  - **Routers**: Connect different networks together and determine the best path for data
  - **Modems**: Convert digital signals to analog (and vice versa) for transmission

### 2. Software Components

- **Operating Systems**: Provide network functionality
- **Network Software**: Applications designed for network use
- **Protocols**: Rules governing how data is transmitted

## Network Topologies

The physical or logical arrangement of devices in a network is called its topology. Each has advantages and disadvantages:

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Bus Topology"
        B1[Computer] --- B2[Computer] --- B3[Computer] --- B4[Computer]
    end
    
    subgraph "Star Topology"
        S1[Computer] --- S[Central Device]
        S2[Computer] --- S
        S3[Computer] --- S
        S4[Computer] --- S
    end
    
    subgraph "Ring Topology"
        R1[Computer] --- R2[Computer]
        R2 --- R3[Computer]
        R3 --- R4[Computer]
        R4 --- R1
    end
    
    subgraph "Mesh Topology"
        M1[Computer] --- M2[Computer]
        M1 --- M3[Computer]
        M1 --- M4[Computer]
        M2 --- M3
        M2 --- M4
        M3 --- M4
    end
```

1. **Bus Topology**: All devices connect to a single cable (the bus)
   - **Pros**: Simple, inexpensive
   - **Cons**: If the main cable fails, the entire network fails

2. **Star Topology**: All devices connect to a central device
   - **Pros**: Easy to add devices, failure of one device doesn't affect others
   - **Cons**: If the central device fails, the entire network fails

3. **Ring Topology**: Devices connect in a closed loop
   - **Pros**: Equal access for all devices
   - **Cons**: Single point of failure can disrupt the entire network

4. **Mesh Topology**: Devices are interconnected with multiple paths
   - **Pros**: Fault-tolerant, high reliability
   - **Cons**: Expensive, complex to implement

## Types of Networks

Networks can be classified by their geographic scope:

1. **LAN (Local Area Network)**: 
   - Covers a small area like a home, office, or building
   - Fast data transfer rates
   - Example: Your home Wi-Fi network

2. **WAN (Wide Area Network)**:
   - Spans a large geographic area, like a country or continent
   - Usually slower than LANs
   - Example: The Internet is the largest WAN

3. **MAN (Metropolitan Area Network)**:
   - Covers a city or large campus
   - Larger than LANs but smaller than WANs
   - Example: City-wide government networks

4. **PAN (Personal Area Network)**:
   - Very small network for personal devices
   - Example: Connecting your phone to your car via Bluetooth

## Network Protocols

Protocols are the rules that govern how data is transmitted over a network. They're like languages that devices use to communicate.

### The TCP/IP Protocol Suite

The most common protocol suite is TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol), which forms the foundation of the Internet.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Application Layer] --> T[Transport Layer]
    T --> I[Internet Layer]
    I --> N[Network Interface Layer]
```

1. **Application Layer**: Protocols users interact with (HTTP, FTP, SMTP, DNS)
2. **Transport Layer**: Manages data flow (TCP, UDP)
3. **Internet Layer**: Handles routing (IP)
4. **Network Interface Layer**: Physical and data link connection

### Common Network Protocols

- **HTTP/HTTPS**: Web browsing
- **FTP**: File transfer
- **SMTP**: Email sending
- **POP3/IMAP**: Email receiving
- **DNS**: Domain name resolution
- **DHCP**: Automatic IP address assignment

## Basic Networking in Practice

Let's write a simple Python program to check if a website is reachable:

```python
import socket

def check_website(url):
    try:
        # Attempt to create a socket connection
        socket.create_connection((url, 80), timeout=5)
        return f"{url} is reachable!"
    except OSError:
        return f"{url} is not reachable."

# Test with some websites
websites = ["google.com", "example.com", "localhost"]

for site in websites:
    print(check_website(site))
```

Output:
```
google.com is reachable!
example.com is reachable!
localhost is not reachable.
```

## IP Addresses and Domain Names

Every device on a network needs an address to receive data. On the Internet, these are called IP addresses.

### IP Addresses

An IPv4 address looks like this: `192.168.1.1` - four numbers separated by dots.

We can use Python to find our computer's IP address:

```python
import socket

# Get hostname
hostname = socket.gethostname()
# Get IP address
ip_address = socket.gethostbyname(hostname)

print(f"Hostname: {hostname}")
print(f"IP Address: {ip_address}")
```

Output (will vary based on your computer):
```
Hostname: MyComputer
IP Address: 192.168.1.105
```

### Domain Names

Domain names are human-readable addresses (like `google.com`) that map to IP addresses. The Domain Name System (DNS) translates between them.

We can look up a domain's IP address:

```python
import socket

domain = "google.com"
ip_address = socket.gethostbyname(domain)

print(f"Domain: {domain}")
print(f"IP Address: {ip_address}")
```

Output:
```
Domain: google.com
IP Address: 142.250.190.78
```
(The actual IP may differ when you run this)

## Network Security Basics

Network security is crucial for protecting your data. Basic security measures include:

1. **Firewalls**: Filter network traffic
2. **Encryption**: Protect data during transmission
3. **Authentication**: Verify users' identities
4. **Access Control**: Limit who can access resources
5. **Regular Updates**: Patch security vulnerabilities

## Real-World Applications

Networks are everywhere in our daily lives:

1. **Home Networks**: Connect your devices to the internet and each other
2. **Business Networks**: Allow companies to share resources and information
3. **Cloud Computing**: Remote servers providing services over the internet
4. **Internet of Things (IoT)**: Connect everyday objects to the internet
5. **Social Media Platforms**: Connect people through network infrastructure
