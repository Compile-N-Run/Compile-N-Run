# Network Documentation

## Introduction

Network documentation is a critical aspect of network management that involves creating and maintaining detailed records of your network infrastructure, configurations, policies, and procedures. Proper documentation serves as a foundation for effective network management, troubleshooting, and future planning.

For beginners in network management, understanding how to document networks effectively is an essential skill that will save countless hours during network issues and provide a clear roadmap for network growth.

## Why Network Documentation Matters

Network documentation is not just busyworkâ€”it provides numerous benefits:

- **Faster troubleshooting**: When issues arise, documentation helps identify the source quickly
- **Knowledge transfer**: New team members can understand the network without relying on tribal knowledge
- **Disaster recovery**: Properly documented networks can be rebuilt more easily after failures
- **Compliance requirements**: Many industries require detailed network documentation
- **Improved security**: Documentation helps identify vulnerabilities and ensure proper security measures
- **Change management**: Track modifications to network infrastructure over time

## Essential Components of Network Documentation

### 1. Network Topology Diagrams

Network diagrams provide visual representations of your network's physical and logical layouts. They should include:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Internet] --- B[Edge Router]
    B --- C[Firewall]
    C --- D[Core Switch]
    D --- E[Server VLAN]
    D --- F[User VLAN]
    D --- G[Guest VLAN]
    E --- H[Web Server]
    E --- I[Database Server]
    F --- J[Workstations]
    G --- K[Guest Wi-Fi]
```

Different types of network diagrams include:

- **Physical topology diagrams**: Show actual physical connections
- **Logical topology diagrams**: Show how data flows through the network
- **Rack diagrams**: Show equipment placement in server racks
- **Wiring diagrams**: Document cable paths and connections

### 2. Network Inventory

Your inventory should include all network devices with details such as:

```
| Device      | Make/Model    | IP Address   | MAC Address       | Location     | Purpose          |
|-------------|---------------|--------------|-------------------|--------------|------------------|
| Router01    | Cisco 4321    | 192.168.1.1  | 00:11:22:33:44:55 | Server Room  | Edge Router      |
| Switch01    | HP ProCurve   | 192.168.1.2  | AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF | Server Room  | Core Switch      |
| AP01        | Ubiquiti UAP  | 192.168.1.10 | 11:22:33:44:55:66 | Office Floor | Wireless Access  |
```

This information can be maintained in spreadsheets, specialized IT asset management software, or network management systems.

### 3. IP Address Management (IPAM)

Document your IP address allocation scheme:

```
| Network       | VLAN ID | Purpose         | Available IPs | Used IPs | Notes                   |
|---------------|---------|-----------------|---------------|----------|-------------------------|
| 192.168.1.0/24| 10      | Management      | 254          | 12       | Network equipment only  |
| 192.168.10.0/24| 20     | User Workstations| 254         | 156      | DHCP range: .50-.200    |
| 192.168.20.0/24| 30     | Servers         | 254          | 28       | Static IP assignments   |
| 192.168.30.0/24| 40     | Guest Network   | 254          | varies   | Isolated from internal  |
```

### 4. Configuration Backups

Store backup configurations for all network devices. Here's a simple script example to back up Cisco device configurations:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import paramiko
import time
import os
from datetime import datetime

# Device connection details
device = {
    'ip': '192.168.1.1',
    'username': 'admin',
    'password': 'secure_password',
    'device_type': 'cisco_ios'
}

# Create backup directory with date
backup_dir = f"backup_{datetime.now().strftime('%Y%m%d')}"
if not os.path.exists(backup_dir):
    os.makedirs(backup_dir)

# Connect to device
ssh_client = paramiko.SSHClient()
ssh_client.set_missing_host_key_policy(paramiko.AutoAddPolicy())
ssh_client.connect(device['ip'], username=device['username'], password=device['password'])

# Start interactive shell
shell = ssh_client.invoke_shell()

# Send commands
shell.send('terminal length 0
')
time.sleep(1)
shell.send('show running-config
')
time.sleep(5)

# Get output
output = shell.recv(65535).decode('utf-8')

# Save to file
filename = f"{backup_dir}/{device['ip']}_config.txt"
with open(filename, 'w') as f:
    f.write(output)

print(f"Backup saved to {filename}")

# Close connection
ssh_client.close()
```

For a production environment, you would want to:
1. Loop through multiple devices
2. Implement proper error handling
3. Use secure credential storage
4. Schedule regular backups

### 5. Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)

Document common network procedures, such as:

- Adding new devices to the network
- Creating/modifying VLANs
- User access provisioning
- Firewall rule changes
- Backup and recovery procedures

Example SOP for adding a new network switch:

```markdown

```

### 6. Network Change Log

Track all changes made to your network:

```
| Date       | Change Description                  | Performed By | Approved By | Ticket # |
|------------|-------------------------------------|--------------|-------------|----------|
| 2023-05-15 | Added VLAN 40 for IoT devices       | Jane Smith   | John Doe    | CHG-1234 |
| 2023-05-20 | Updated firewall rules for new VPN  | Mike Johnson | Sarah Lee   | CHG-1235 |
| 2023-06-01 | Replaced failed switch in Rack B4   | Jane Smith   | John Doe    | INC-5678 |
```

### 7. Network Policies and Security Documentation

Document network policies including:

- Password policy
- Access control policy
- Firewall rule management
- Wireless network security
- Remote access requirements
- Incident response procedures

Example password policy:

```markdown
# Network Device Password Policy

## Purpose

## Scope
This policy applies to all network devices including routers, switches, firewalls, wireless controllers, and access points.

## Policy
1. All default passwords must be changed before devices are deployed in production
2. Passwords must be a minimum of 14 characters
3. Passwords must include:
   - Uppercase letters
   - Lowercase letters
   - Numbers
   - Special characters
4. Device passwords must be changed every 90 days
5. Previous 5 passwords cannot be reused
6. Passwords must be stored in the approved password management system
7. Only administrators with proper clearance have access to network device passwords
8. All password changes must be documented in the change management system
```

## Documentation Tools

Several tools can help with network documentation:

1. **Diagramming tools**:
   - Lucidchart
   - draw.io
   - Microsoft Visio

2. **IPAM solutions**:
   - NetBox

## Practical Example: Documenting a Small Office Network

Let's walk through documenting a small office network with:
- 1 Internet router
- 1 Firewall
- 2 Switches
- 1 Wireless access point
- 20 Workstations
- 3 Servers

### Step 1: Create Network Diagram

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Internet] --- B[Router - 192.168.1.1]
    B --- C[Firewall - 192.168.1.2]
    C --- D[Core Switch - 192.168.1.3]
    D --- E[Access Switch 1 - 192.168.1.4]
    D --- F[Access Switch 2 - 192.168.1.5]
    E --- G[Wireless AP - 192.168.1.6]
    E --- H[Workstations 1-10]
    F --- I[Workstations 11-20]
    F --- J[File Server - 192.168.1.10]
    F --- K[Email Server - 192.168.1.11]
    F --- L[Web Server - 192.168.1.12]
```

### Step 2: Document IP Address Scheme

```
VLAN 10 - Management: 192.168.1.0/24
VLAN 20 - Staff: 192.168.10.0/24
VLAN 30 - Servers: 192.168.20.0/24
VLAN 40 - Guest: 192.168.30.0/24
```

### Step 3: Document Configuration Standards

Example switch configuration standard:

```
! Standard Switch Configuration Template
hostname SWITCH-[LOCATION]-[NUMBER]
!
enable secret [SECURE-PASSWORD]
!
no ip domain-lookup
ip domain-name company.local
!
username admin privilege 15 secret [SECURE-PASSWORD]
!
vlan 10
 name Management
vlan 20
 name Staff
vlan 30
 name Servers
vlan 40
 name Guest
!
interface Vlan10
 ip address [ASSIGNED-IP] 255.255.255.0
 no shutdown
!
ip default-gateway 192.168.1.1
!
line con 0
 logging synchronous
 login local
line vty 0 15
 logging synchronous
 login local
 transport input ssh
!
ntp server 192.168.1.10
!
service timestamps log datetime msec
logging 192.168.1.10
!
spanning-tree mode rapid-pvst
!
end
```

### Step 4: Create Device Inventory

Maintain a detailed inventory of all network devices with support contract information, purchase dates, warranty details, and maintenance schedules.

### Step 5: Document Backup Procedures

```markdown
# Network Backup Procedure

## Scheduled Backups
- Configuration backups run automatically every night at 1:00 AM
- Backups stored on backup server at 192.168.1.15:/backups/network
- Retention policy: Daily backups kept for 30 days, monthly backups kept for 1 year

## Manual Backup Process
1. Log into device
2. Execute appropriate backup command:
   - Cisco: `show running-config`
   - FortiGate: `show full-configuration`
   - HP: `show running-config`
3. Save output to file with naming convention: [device-name]_[date]_config.txt
4. Upload file to backup server

## Restoration Process
1. Connect to device via console
2. Enter configuration mode
3. Apply configuration using appropriate method:
   - Cisco: `copy tftp://192.168.1.15/backup/[filename] running-config`
   - FortiGate: Restore from management interface
   - HP: `copy tftp://192.168.1.15/backup/[filename] startup-config`
4. Verify configuration
5. Document the restoration in the change log
```

## Automating Network Documentation

As your network grows, manual documentation becomes increasingly difficult. Consider these automation approaches:

### Using Python for Automated Inventory

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import csv
from netmiko import ConnectHandler
import json

# List of devices to inventory
devices = [
    {
        'device_type': 'cisco_ios',
        'ip': '192.168.1.1',
        'username': 'admin',
        'password': 'password123',
    },
    {
        'device_type': 'cisco_ios',
        'ip': '192.168.1.2',
        'username': 'admin',
        'password': 'password123',
    }
]

# Create CSV file for inventory
with open('network_inventory.csv', 'w', newline='') as csvfile:
    fieldnames = ['hostname', 'ip_address', 'model', 'ios_version', 'serial_number']
    writer = csv.DictWriter(csvfile, fieldnames=fieldnames)
    writer.writeheader()
    
    # Connect to each device and gather information
    for device in devices:
        try:
            # Connect to device
            connection = ConnectHandler(**device)
            
            # Get hostname
            hostname = connection.send_command('show run | include hostname')
            hostname = hostname.split('hostname ')[1] if 'hostname' in hostname else 'Unknown'
            
            # Get version info
            version_info = connection.send_command('show version', use_textfsm=True)
            
            if version_info and isinstance(version_info, list) and len(version_info) > 0:
                version_data = version_info[0]
                model = version_data.get('hardware', 'Unknown')
                ios_version = version_data.get('version', 'Unknown')
                serial = version_data.get('serial', 'Unknown')
            else:
                model = 'Error retrieving'
                ios_version = 'Error retrieving'
                serial = 'Error retrieving'
            
            # Write to CSV
            writer.writerow({
                'hostname': hostname,
                'ip_address': device['ip'],
                'model': model,
                'ios_version': ios_version,
                'serial_number': serial
            })
            
            connection.disconnect()
            print(f"Successfully inventoried {device['ip']}")
            
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Failed to inventory {device['ip']}: {str(e)}")

print("Inventory complete. Results saved to network_inventory.csv")
```

This script requires the following packages: `netmiko` and `textfsm`.

### Using Network Management Systems

Modern network management systems can automatically discover and document your network, including:

- Device configurations
- Network topology
- IP address usage
- Performance metrics
- Changes over time

## Best Practices for Continuous Documentation

Documentation is not a one-time project but an ongoing process:

1. **Make documentation part of change management**: No change is complete until documentation is updated
2. **Review regularly**: Schedule quarterly reviews of all documentation
3. **Assign ownership**: Make specific team members responsible for different aspects
4. **Automate where possible**: Use scripts and tools to keep information current
5. **Use version control**: Track changes to documentation over time
6. **Validate accuracy**: Periodically verify that documentation matches reality
7. **Collect feedback**: Ask team members what's missing or unclear

## Summary

Network documentation is a critical foundation for effective network management. Proper documentation:

- Accelerates troubleshooting
- Facilitates knowledge transfer
- Supports disaster recovery
- Assists with compliance
- Improves security posture
- Enables effective change management

For beginners, starting with basic documentation and gradually expanding is the best approach. Focus on:

1. Network diagrams
2. Device inventory
3. IP address management
4. Configuration backups
5. Standard procedures
6. Change logs

As your skills and network grow, incorporate automation tools to maintain accurate documentation with less manual effort.
