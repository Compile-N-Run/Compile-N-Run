# Networks Tools

## Introduction

Networks tools are essential utilities for managing, analyzing, and troubleshooting computer networks. They help IT professionals monitor network traffic, diagnose connectivity issues, and optimize network performance.

## Common Network Tools

### Diagnostic Tools
- **Ping**: Tests basic connectivity between devices
- **Traceroute/Tracert**: Maps the path packets take across a network
- **nslookup/dig**: Queries DNS servers to resolve hostnames to IP addresses
- **Netstat**: Displays network connections, routing tables, and interface statistics

### Packet Analysis
- **Wireshark**: Professional-grade packet analyzer for deep inspection of network traffic
- **tcpdump**: Command-line packet analyzer for capturing and analyzing network traffic

### Monitoring Tools
- **SNMP Utilities**: For monitoring network devices using Simple Network Management Protocol
- **Bandwidth Monitors**: Tools like iftop, nethogs, and bmon for real-time bandwidth monitoring

## Basic Network Diagnostics

Here's how to use basic network diagnostic commands:

```bash
# Test connectivity to a server
ping google.com

# Output example:
# PING google.com (142.250.190.78) 56(84) bytes of data.
# 64 bytes from lga25s73-in-f14.1e100.net (142.250.190.78): icmp_seq=1 ttl=115 time=7.35 ms
# 64 bytes from lga25s73-in-f14.1e100.net (142.250.190.78): icmp_seq=2 ttl=115 time=6.98 ms

# Trace the route to a destination
traceroute google.com

# Check DNS resolution
nslookup google.com
```

## Network Configuration

Common network configuration commands:

```bash
# Display network interfaces
ifconfig   # on Linux/macOS
ipconfig   # on Windows

# Display routing table
route      # on Linux/macOS
route print # on Windows

# Configure a static IP (Linux)
sudo ip addr add 192.168.1.100/24 dev eth0
```

## Network Security Tools

```bash
# Port scanning with nmap
nmap -sV 192.168.1.1

# Check for open listening ports
netstat -tuln
```

## Summary

Network tools are indispensable for IT professionals. Starting with basic diagnostic commands like ping and traceroute provides a foundation for network troubleshooting, while more advanced tools like Wireshark enable detailed analysis of network traffic.

For beginners, learning these tools in a controlled environment is recommended before applying them in production networks.
