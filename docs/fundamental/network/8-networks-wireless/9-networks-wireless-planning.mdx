```

Let's explore each of these phases in detail.

## Requirements Analysis

Before planning a wireless network, you need to understand the specific requirements it must fulfill:

- **Coverage area**: Where do users need wireless access?
- **User density**: How many users will connect simultaneously in different areas?
- **Application needs**: What will users be doing (browsing, streaming, VoIP, etc.)?
- **Security requirements**: What level of security is needed?
- **Budget constraints**: What resources are available for the network?

**Example Requirements Document:**

```
# Wireless Network Requirements
- Coverage: 3-floor office building (30,000 sq ft total)
- Users: 150 employees + 50 guests (maximum)
- Applications: Web browsing, email, video conferencing, CRM software
- Security: WPA3-Enterprise with RADIUS authentication
- Special areas: Conference rooms need higher capacity (25 users)
- Budget: $25,000 for equipment and installation
```

## Site Survey

A site survey is a critical step in wireless planning where you analyze the physical environment to identify:

1. **Physical obstacles**: Walls, windows, doors, furniture that affect signal
2. **Sources of interference**: Other wireless networks, microwave ovens, Bluetooth devices
3. **Coverage requirements**: Where users need connectivity
4. **Existing infrastructure**: Cable pathways, power sources, mounting locations

### Types of Site Surveys

#### 1. Preliminary Survey

This involves reviewing floor plans and walking through the site to identify obvious challenges.

#### 2. Passive Survey

Conducted by walking through the area with specialized tools to measure existing RF (Radio Frequency) signals:

```javascript
// Example of processing passive survey data with JavaScript
function analyzeSignalStrength(readings) {
  const averageSignal = readings.reduce((sum, reading) => sum + reading.rssi, 0) / readings.length;
  const interferingSources = readings.filter(reading => reading.ssid !== "OurNetwork" && reading.rssi > -70);
  
  return {
    averageSignal,
    interferenceLevel: interferingSources.length > 5 ? "High" : "Low",
    recommendedChannels: findClearChannels(readings)
  };
}

function findClearChannels(readings) {
  // Logic to identify least congested channels
  // Returns array of recommended channels
}
```

#### 3. Active Survey

Involves temporarily setting up access points and measuring actual performance:

```python
# Example Python script to process active survey results
def calculate_coverage_quality(signal_readings):
    coverage_map = {}
    for reading in signal_readings:
        location = reading["location"]
        signal = reading["signal_strength"]
        noise = reading["noise_floor"]
        snr = signal - noise  # Signal-to-Noise Ratio
        
        if snr > 25:
            quality = "Excellent"
        elif snr > 20:
            quality = "Good"
        elif snr > 15:
            quality = "Fair"
        else:
            quality = "Poor"
            
        coverage_map[location] = quality
    
    return coverage_map
```

#### 4. Predictive Survey

Uses specialized software to simulate wireless coverage based on floor plans and building materials:

```python
# Example of how predictive survey tools might calculate attenuation
def calculate_signal_attenuation(distance, obstacles):
    # Free space path loss calculation
    path_loss = 20 * math.log10(distance) + 20 * math.log10(frequency) - 27.55
    
    # Add attenuation from obstacles
    total_attenuation = path_loss
    for obstacle in obstacles:
        if obstacle == "concrete_wall":
            total_attenuation += 12  # dB
        elif obstacle == "glass_window":
            total_attenuation += 3   # dB
        elif obstacle == "wooden_door":
            total_attenuation += 4   # dB
    
    return total_attenuation
```

## Capacity Planning

Capacity planning ensures your network can handle the expected load:

### Bandwidth Requirements

Calculate the bandwidth required for different areas based on:

1. Number of users
2. Types of applications
3. Concurrent usage patterns

```javascript
// Example function to estimate bandwidth requirements
function estimateBandwidth(users, applications) {
  let totalBandwidth = 0;
  
  // Calculate per-user bandwidth needs based on applications
  users.forEach(user => {
    if (user.usesVideoConferencing) totalBandwidth += 2.5; // 2.5 Mbps
    if (user.usesCloudApps) totalBandwidth += 1.0; // 1 Mbps
    if (user.streamsMedia) totalBandwidth += 5.0; // 5 Mbps
    // Basic web browsing/email
    totalBandwidth += 0.5; // 0.5 Mbps baseline
  });
  
  // Apply concurrent usage factor (not everyone uses maximum bandwidth simultaneously)
  const concurrentFactor = 0.6; // 60% concurrent usage
  
  return totalBandwidth * concurrentFactor;
}
```

### Access Point Capacity

Each access point has limits on:

1. **Maximum client connections**: Typically 25-50 clients per AP for optimal performance
2. **Maximum throughput**: Varies by standard (802.11ac, 802.11ax, etc.)

**Sample Calculation:**

```
For a conference room with 25 users:
- Average bandwidth per user: 2 Mbps
- Total required bandwidth: 50 Mbps
- Selected AP capacity: 867 Mbps (802.11ac Wave 2)
- Effective capacity (accounting for overhead): ~400 Mbps
- Result: One AP should handle the load with headroom for peak usage
```

## Equipment Selection

Selecting the right equipment involves evaluating:

### Access Points

- **Standards**: 802.11n, 802.11ac, 802.11ax (Wi-Fi 6)
- **Radio bands**: 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, 6 GHz
- **MIMO capabilities**: Multiple-Input, Multiple-Output antennas
- **Power options**: PoE (Power over Ethernet), DC power
- **Management features**: Standalone vs. controller-based

### Wireless Controllers

For larger deployments, wireless controllers provide centralized management:

```javascript
// Example of a controller configuration script
const controllerConfig = {
  managementVLAN: 10,
  apGroups: [
    {
      name: "Office-Standard",
      ssids: ["Corporate", "Guest"],
      radioSettings: {
        channel: "auto",
        txPower: "auto",
        channelWidth: "40MHz"
      }
    },
    {
      name: "Conference-Rooms",
      ssids: ["Corporate", "Guest", "Presentation"],
      radioSettings: {
        channel: "auto",
        txPower: "high",
        channelWidth: "80MHz"
      }
    }
  ]
};
```

### Antennas

Different antenna types serve different purposes:

1. **Omnidirectional**: Broadcasts in all directions
2. **Directional**: Focuses signal in specific directions
3. **Ceiling-mounted**: For open office spaces
4. **Wall-mounted**: For hallways and corridors

## Network Design

With survey data and equipment selected, create a detailed network design:

### Access Point Placement

Best practices for AP placement include:

- **Height**: Mount APs 10-15 feet high when possible
- **Spacing**: Maintain appropriate distance between APs (typically 30-50 feet)
- **Overlap**: Ensure 20-30% signal overlap for roaming
- **Obstacles**: Account for walls and other signal barriers

### Channel Planning

To minimize interference, plan channel allocation carefully:

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "2.4 GHz Band"
    A[Channel 1] --- B[Channel 6] --- C[Channel 11]
    end
    
    subgraph "5 GHz Band"
    D[Channel 36] --- E[Channel 40] --- F[Channel 44] --- G[Channel 48]
    H[Channel 149] --- I[Channel 153] --- J[Channel 157] --- K[Channel 161]
    end
```

**Channel Planning Example:**

```python
# Simplified channel planning algorithm
def assign_channels(access_points):
    # For 2.4 GHz
    available_24ghz_channels = [1, 6, 11]
    # For 5 GHz (simplified list)
    available_5ghz_channels = [36, 40, 44, 48, 149, 153, 157, 161]
    
    for idx, ap in enumerate(access_points):
        # Assign 2.4 GHz channel
        ap.channel_24ghz = available_24ghz_channels[idx % len(available_24ghz_channels)]
        
        # Assign 5 GHz channel
        ap.channel_5ghz = available_5ghz_channels[idx % len(available_5ghz_channels)]
    
    # Check for adjacent AP interference and adjust as needed
    optimize_channel_assignments(access_points)
    
    return access_points
```

### SSID and Security Planning

Decide on network names and security settings:

```javascript
// Example SSID configuration
const networkConfiguration = [
  {
    ssid: "CorporateNet",
    security: "WPA3-Enterprise",
    vlan: 10,
    qos: "high",
    authentication: "RADIUS",
    radiusServer: "192.168.1.100"
  },
  {
    ssid: "GuestNet",
    security: "WPA3-Personal",
    vlan: 20,
    qos: "low",
    captivePortal: true,
    bandwidthLimit: "5Mbps"
  }
];
```

## Implementation

During implementation, follow these steps:

1. **Install physical infrastructure**: Mount APs, run cables
2. **Configure network settings**: Set up SSIDs, security, VLANs
3. **Integrate with existing systems**: Connect to authentication servers
4. **Document the installation**: Record AP locations, configurations

**Implementation Checklist:**

```
□ Verify power availability at AP locations
□ Install mounting brackets
□ Run Ethernet cables to each AP
□ Label all cables
□ Mount access points
□ Connect APs to network switches
□ Configure wireless controller
□ Set up SSIDs and security profiles
□ Configure advanced features (band steering, airtime fairness)
□ Verify connectivity
```

## Testing and Validation

After implementation, thoroughly test the network:

### Coverage Testing

Verify signal strength throughout the coverage area:

```python
# Example of processing coverage test results
def evaluate_coverage(test_points):
    problem_areas = []
    
    for point in test_points:
        if point["signal_strength"] < -70:  # dBm
            problem_areas.append({
                "location": point["location"],
                "signal": point["signal_strength"],
                "recommended_action": "Consider additional AP"
            })
    
    coverage_score = (len(test_points) - len(problem_areas)) / len(test_points) * 100
    
    return {
        "coverage_score": coverage_score,
        "problem_areas": problem_areas
    }
```

### Performance Testing

Test actual throughput and response times:

```bash
# Example commands for network performance testing
$ iperf3 -c server_ip -t 30  # Test throughput for 30 seconds
$ ping -c 100 server_ip      # Test latency with 100 pings
$ wget http://test-file.com/100mb.test  # Test download speed
```

### Client Device Testing

Test with various devices (laptops, phones, tablets) to ensure compatibility.

## Optimization

Based on testing, optimize the network:

1. **Adjust AP placement** if coverage gaps are found
2. **Fine-tune power levels** to balance coverage
3. **Reconfigure channels** if interference is detected
4. **Update QoS settings** to prioritize critical applications

```javascript
// Example optimization script
function optimizeNetwork(testResults) {
  const recommendations = [];
  
  // Check for coverage issues
  testResults.coverageTests.forEach(test => {
    if (test.signalStrength < -70) {
      recommendations.push({
        type: "coverage",
        location: test.location,
        action: "Increase AP power or add additional AP"
      });
    }
  });
  
  // Check for interference issues
  testResults.interferenceTests.forEach(test => {
    if (test.interferenceLevel > 20) {
      recommendations.push({
        type: "interference",
        location: test.location,
        action: "Change channel or adjust neighboring AP power"
      });
    }
  });
  
  return recommendations;
}
```

## Documentation

Maintain comprehensive documentation of your wireless network:

1. **Network diagrams** showing AP locations
2. **Configuration details** for all equipment
3. **Test results** showing coverage and performance
4. **Maintenance procedures** for ongoing operations
