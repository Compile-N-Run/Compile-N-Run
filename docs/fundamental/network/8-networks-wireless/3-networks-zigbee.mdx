# Zigbee Networks

## Introduction

Zigbee is a low-power, low-data-rate wireless networking technology designed specifically for control and sensor applications. It's an ideal solution for creating personal area networks built from small, low-power digital radios. Zigbee operates on the IEEE 802.15.4 physical radio specification and operates in unlicensed radio frequency bands including 2.4 GHz, 900 MHz, and 868 MHz.

Unlike Wi-Fi which is designed for high-bandwidth applications, Zigbee focuses on:
- Low power consumption
- Lower data rates (250 kbit/s)
- Mesh networking capability
- Self-healing networks
- Secure communications

This makes Zigbee particularly well-suited for Internet of Things (IoT) devices, smart home automation, industrial control systems, and medical device data collection.

## Zigbee Architecture

Zigbee's architecture consists of several key components:

### Network Topology

Zigbee supports three types of network topologies:

graph TD
    A[Coordinator] --- B[Router]
    A --- C[Router]
    B --- D[End Device]
    B --- E[End Device]
    C --- F[End Device]
    C --- G[Router]
    G --- H[End Device]
    
    classDef coordinator fill:#ff5733,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px;
    classDef router fill:#33b5ff,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px;
    classDef endDevice fill:#33ff57,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px;
    
    class A coordinator;
    class B,C,G router;
    class D,E,F,H endDevice;
```

1. **Star Topology**: All devices connect to a central coordinator
2. **Tree Topology**: A hierarchical arrangement with the coordinator at the root
3. **Mesh Topology**: The most common and robust, allowing multiple pathways for data

### Node Types

Zigbee networks consist of three types of devices:

1. **Zigbee Coordinator (ZC)**: 
   - The most capable device
   - Forms the root of the network tree
   - Can bridge to other networks
   - There is exactly one coordinator in each network
   - Manages the network security keys

2. **Zigbee Router (ZR)**:
   - Can relay data from other devices
   - Participates in multi-hop routing of messages
   - Typically mains-powered devices

3. **Zigbee End Device (ZED)**:
   - Contains just enough functionality to communicate with its parent node
   - Cannot relay data from other devices
   - Can be battery-operated with sleep capabilities
   - Requires the least amount of memory and processing power

### Zigbee Protocol Stack

The Zigbee protocol stack is built on top of the IEEE 802.15.4 standard:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Application Layer: ZDO & Application Profiles] --> B[Network Layer]
    B --> C[MAC Layer - IEEE 802.15.4]
    C --> D[Physical Layer - IEEE 802.15.4]
    
    classDef zigbee fill:#ff9933,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px;
    classDef ieee fill:#33b5ff,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px;
    
    class A,B zigbee;
    class C,D ieee;
```

- **Application Layer**: Consists of the Application Support Sublayer (APS), Zigbee Device Object (ZDO), and application framework
- **Network Layer**: Responsible for network formation, routing, and security
- **MAC Layer**: Handles reliable transmissions, addressing, and channel access
- **Physical Layer**: Manages radio transmissions, frequencies, and modulations

## Key Features of Zigbee

### Mesh Networking

One of Zigbee's most powerful features is its self-forming and self-healing mesh network capability:

- **Self-forming**: Devices can automatically discover and join the network
- **Self-healing**: If a router fails, devices can find alternate routes for communication
- **Extended range**: Data can hop through multiple routers to reach distant devices

### Security Features

Zigbee implements robust security measures:

- **128-bit AES encryption** 
- **Network keys** for securing network-level communications
- **Link keys** for securing application-level communications
- **Trust Center** (typically the coordinator) for managing security keys

### Energy Efficiency

Zigbee is designed for low power consumption:

- End devices can sleep for extended periods
- Battery-powered devices can operate for years on a single battery
- Efficient protocol design minimizes transmission times

## Implementing Zigbee Networks

### Hardware Requirements

To build a Zigbee network, you'll need:

1. **Zigbee Coordinator** - Typically a development board with a Zigbee-capable microcontroller and radio
2. **Zigbee Routers and/or End Devices** - Additional devices that will form your network
3. **Zigbee Module** - Common modules include:
   - Silicon Labs' EFR32MG
   - Texas Instruments' CC2530/CC2531
   - NXP's JN516x series

### Software Implementation Example

Here's a simple example of initializing a Zigbee network using the Texas Instruments Z-Stack:

```c
// Initialize the Zigbee stack
void zb_init() {
  // Register the endpoint
  zclSampleSw_Init(&sampleSw_SimpleDesc);
  
  // Set channels
  uint32_t channelList = (1 << 11); // Channel 11
  
  // Start the device
  zclSampleSw_StartCoordinator(channelList);
}

// Example coordinator initialization
void zclSampleSw_StartCoordinator(uint32_t channelList) {
  zstack_startupReq_t startupReq;
  
  // Set startup parameters
  memset(&startupReq, 0, sizeof(zstack_startupReq_t));
  startupReq.startDelay = 0;
  
  // Send startup request to stack
  Zstackapi_startupReq(appServiceTaskId, &startupReq);
}
```

### Joining a Zigbee Network

End devices need to join the network. Here's how a join process might be implemented:

```c
// Join a network
void joinNetwork() {
  zstack_bdbStartCommissioningReq_t commissioningReq;
  
  // Clear the structure
  memset(&commissioningReq, 0, sizeof(zstack_bdbStartCommissioningReq_t));
  
  // Set commissioning mode to join network
  commissioningReq.commissioning_mode = BDB_COMMISSIONING_MODE_NWK_STEERING;
  
  // Send join request to stack
  Zstackapi_bdbStartCommissioningReq(appServiceTaskId, &commissioningReq);
}
```

### Sending Data Over a Zigbee Network

Here's an example of sending a simple command from one device to another:

```c
// Send a toggle command to a light
void sendToggleCommand(uint16_t dstAddr) {
  zclGeneral_SendOnOff_CmdToggle(SAMPLESW_ENDPOINT, &dstAddr, FALSE, 0);
}
```

## Real-World Applications

### Smart Home Automation

Zigbee is widely used in home automation systems:

1. **Lighting Control**: Philips Hue, IKEA TRÃ…DFRI, and other smart lighting solutions use Zigbee
2. **Smart Thermostats**: Many heating/cooling systems use Zigbee for communication
3. **Security Systems**: Door/window sensors and motion detectors often use Zigbee
4. **Smart Speakers**: Amazon Echo Plus, Echo Show, and other devices have built-in Zigbee hubs

### Implementation Example: Smart Lighting System

```c
// Handler for incoming On/Off commands
void zclSampleLight_OnOffCB(uint8_t cmd) {
  switch(cmd) {
    case COMMAND_ON:
      // Turn on the LED
      turnOnLED();
      break;
    
    case COMMAND_OFF:
      // Turn off the LED
      turnOffLED();
      break;
    
    case COMMAND_TOGGLE:
      // Toggle the LED
      toggleLED();
      break;
  }
  
  // Update the attribute value
  zclSampleLight_OnOff = (cmd == COMMAND_OFF) ? FALSE : TRUE;
}
```

### Industrial Monitoring

Zigbee is used in industrial settings for:

1. **Environmental Monitoring**: Temperature, humidity, and pressure sensors
2. **Asset Tracking**: Location and status of equipment
3. **Predictive Maintenance**: Monitoring equipment for signs of failure

### Healthcare Applications
