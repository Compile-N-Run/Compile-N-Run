   - Better building penetration
   - Lower data rates (100-200 Mbps)
   
2. **Mid-band (1-6 GHz)**
   - Balance of coverage and capacity
   - Most commonly deployed initially
   - Speeds of 100-900 Mbps
   
3. **High-band/mmWave (24-100 GHz)**
   - Extremely high data rates (1-3 Gbps)
   - Very limited range (< 500 meters)
   - Poor penetration through obstacles
   - Requires dense network of small cells

## Programming for 5G Networks

For developers, 5G creates new opportunities and challenges. Let's explore some practical examples of how programming interfaces with 5G technology.

### Example 1: Retrieving Network Information

JavaScript code to detect network type and speed:

```javascript
// Function to check network type and speed
function checkNetworkCapabilities() {
  // Get connection information
  const connection = navigator.connection || 
                     navigator.mozConnection || 
                     navigator.webkitConnection;
  
  if (!connection) {
    console.log('Network Information API not supported');
    return;
  }
  
  // Display network information
  console.log('Network Type:', connection.type);
  console.log('Effective Type:', connection.effectiveType);
  console.log('Downlink Speed (Mbps):', connection.downlink);
  console.log('Round Trip Time (ms):', connection.rtt);
  
  // Check if we're on a 5G connection
  if (connection.effectiveType === '4g' && connection.downlink > 100) {
    console.log('Likely on 5G network');
    // Enable high-bandwidth features
    enableHighBandwidthFeatures();
  }
}

function enableHighBandwidthFeatures() {
  // Increase video quality, enable real-time features, etc.
  console.log('High bandwidth features enabled');
}

// Call the function
checkNetworkCapabilities();
```

Output (example):
```
Network Type: cellular
Effective Type: 4g
Downlink Speed (Mbps): 150
Round Trip Time (ms): 15
Likely on 5G network
High bandwidth features enabled
```

### Example 2: Adaptive Content Loading

```javascript
// Function to adaptively load content based on network capabilities
async function loadAdaptiveContent() {
  const connection = navigator.connection || 
                     navigator.mozConnection || 
                     navigator.webkitConnection;
  
  let videoQuality = 'standard';
  
  if (connection) {
    if (connection.downlink > 100 && connection.rtt < 30) {
      videoQuality = '4k'; // 5G-level performance
    } else if (connection.downlink > 5 && connection.rtt < 100) {
      videoQuality = 'hd'; // Good 4G or entry-level 5G
    }
    
    // Listen for changes in connection
    connection.addEventListener('change', () => {
      console.log('Network conditions changed, adjusting content quality');
      loadAdaptiveContent();
    });
  }
  
  console.log(`Loading ${videoQuality} content`);
  
  // Fetch appropriate resources based on network quality
  try {
    const response = await fetch(`/api/content?quality=${videoQuality}`);
    const data = await response.json();
    renderContent(data);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error loading content:', error);
    fallbackToLowerQuality();
  }
}

function renderContent(data) {
  console.log('Content loaded successfully:', data.quality);
  // Actual rendering code would go here
}

function fallbackToLowerQuality() {
  console.log('Falling back to lower quality content');
  // Fallback implementation
}
```

## 5G Application Scenarios for Developers

### Real-time AR/VR Applications

5G's low latency and high bandwidth make immersive augmented and virtual reality applications practical on mobile devices. Developers can now create experiences that were previously limited to wired setups.

```javascript
// Example: WebXR with network quality detection
function initializeARExperience() {
  // Check if we have sufficient network capabilities for high-quality AR
  const connection = navigator.connection;
  
  if (connection && connection.downlink > 50 && connection.rtt < 30) {
    // High-quality AR assets
    console.log('Loading high-quality AR assets');
    arQuality = 'high';
  } else {
    // Use lower quality assets to ensure smooth experience
    console.log('Loading standard-quality AR assets');
    arQuality = 'standard';
  }
  
  // Initialize WebXR session with appropriate quality settings
  const xrSession = {
    quality: arQuality,
    assetPath: `/assets/${arQuality}/`,
    maxPolygons: arQuality === 'high' ? 100000 : 20000
  };
  
  console.log('AR session initialized with settings:', xrSession);
}
```

### Edge Computing Integration

5G networks integrate edge computing capabilities, allowing computation to happen closer to end users. This reduces latency and enables new types of applications.

```javascript
// Function to determine optimal processing location (device, edge, or cloud)
function determineProcessingLocation(taskComplexity, latencyRequirement) {
  const connection = navigator.connection;
  
  if (!connection) {
    return 'device'; // Default to on-device if we can't detect network
  }
  
  // For tasks requiring extremely low latency on 5G
  if (latencyRequirement < 20 && connection.rtt < 30 && connection.downlink > 50) {
    return 'edge'; // Process at network edge
  }
  
  // For complex tasks with less strict latency requirements
  if (taskComplexity > 7) {
    return 'cloud'; // Process in the cloud
  }
  
  // Default to processing on device
  return 'device';
}

// Example usage
const location = determineProcessingLocation(5, 15);
console.log(`Processing at: ${location}`);
```

### IoT and Massive Device Connectivity

5G enables connecting thousands of devices in a small area, perfect for IoT applications and smart cities.

```javascript
// Simple example of an IoT device manager
class IoTDeviceManager {
  constructor() {
    this.devices = [];
    this.connectionMode = this.detectConnectionMode();
  }
  
  detectConnectionMode() {
    const connection = navigator.connection;
    
    if (connection && connection.downlink > 100 && connection.rtt < 20) {
      return '5g';
    } else if (connection && connection.downlink > 5) {
      return '4g';
    } else {
      return 'low-bandwidth';
    }
  }
  
  setDataCollectionRate() {
    // With 5G, we can collect data much more frequently
    switch (this.connectionMode) {
      case '5g':
        return 1000; // Poll every second
      case '4g':
        return 5000; // Poll every 5 seconds
      default:
        return 60000; // Poll every minute on slower connections
    }
  }
  
  startMonitoring() {
    const pollRate = this.setDataCollectionRate();
    console.log(`Monitoring devices with ${this.connectionMode} network, polling every ${pollRate}ms`);
    
    // Set up polling for each device
    setInterval(() => {
      this.devices.forEach(device => {
        this.collectData(device);
      });
    }, pollRate);
  }
  
  collectData(device) {
    console.log(`Collecting data from device ${device.id}`);
    // Actual data collection code would go here
  }
  
  addDevice(device) {
    this.devices.push(device);
    console.log(`Added device ${device.id}, total devices: ${this.devices.length}`);
  }
}

// Example usage
const manager = new IoTDeviceManager();
manager.addDevice({ id: 'temp-sensor-001', type: 'temperature' });
manager.addDevice({ id: 'humidity-sensor-002', type: 'humidity' });
manager.startMonitoring();
```
