# Ruby Interview Questions

## Introduction

Ruby is a dynamic, object-oriented programming language known for its elegant syntax and developer-friendly features. Created by Yukihiro Matsumoto (Matz) in the mid-1990s, Ruby emphasizes the principle of "least surprise" and prioritizes developer happiness.

As you prepare for Ruby-focused technical interviews, understanding core concepts and common questions will significantly boost your confidence. This guide covers essential Ruby interview questions, from basic syntax to more advanced concepts, with practical examples and clear explanations to help you succeed.

## Basic Ruby Questions

### 1. What is Ruby and what are its key features?

**Answer:** Ruby is a dynamic, interpreted, object-oriented programming language created by Yukihiro Matsumoto in the mid-1990s.

Key features include:
- **Pure Object-Oriented:** Everything in Ruby is an object
- **Dynamic Typing:** Variable types are determined at runtime
- **Flexible Syntax:** Offers multiple ways to accomplish tasks
- **Metaprogramming:** Ability to write code that writes code
- **Garbage Collection:** Automatic memory management
- **Rich Standard Library:** Comes with extensive built-in functionality
- **Open Source:** Free to use and modify

### 2. How do you declare variables in Ruby?

**Answer:** In Ruby, variables are declared without specifying types:

```ruby
# Local variables
name = "John"
age = 30

# Instance variables (belong to object instances)
@count = 0

# Class variables (shared across all instances of a class)
@@total_users = 0

# Global variables (accessible throughout the program)
$app_name = "MyRubyApp"

# Constants (should not be changed)
PI = 3.14159
```

### 3. What are the different data types in Ruby?

**Answer:** Ruby has several built-in data types:

```ruby
# Numeric types
integer_number = 42
float_number = 3.14
complex_number = 1 + 2i

# Boolean
is_valid = true
is_expired = false

# String
name = "Ruby"
multiline_string = %Q{
  This is a
  multiline string
}

# Symbol (immutable, reusable identifiers)
status = :active

# Array
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"]

# Hash (key-value pairs)
person = { "name" => "Alice", "age" => 25 }
person_symbols = { name: "Bob", age: 30 }  # Alternate syntax

# Range
one_to_ten = 1..10  # Inclusive range
alphabet = 'a'...'z'  # Exclusive range

# Nil (Ruby's version of null)
result = nil
```

### 4. Explain the difference between `nil` and `false` in Ruby.

**Answer:** Both `nil` and `false` are considered "falsy" in conditional expressions, but they are different:

- `nil` is a special value representing the absence of a value or a null reference
- `false` is a boolean value representing logical falseness

```ruby
# Testing nil and false in conditions
if nil
  puts "This won't print"
else
  puts "nil is falsy"  # This will print
end

if false
  puts "This won't print"
else
  puts "false is falsy"  # This will print
end

# nil and false are not equal
puts nil == false  # Outputs: false

# Checking for nil
puts nil.nil?  # Outputs: true
puts false.nil?  # Outputs: false

# nil is an object of NilClass
puts nil.class  # Outputs: NilClass
puts false.class  # Outputs: FalseClass
```

## Object-Oriented Programming in Ruby

### 5. How do you define a class in Ruby?

**Answer:** Classes in Ruby are defined using the `class` keyword:

```ruby
class Person
  # Constructor method
  def initialize(name, age)
    @name = name  # Instance variable
    @age = age    # Instance variable
  end
  
  # Instance method
  def introduce
    "Hi, I'm #{@name} and I'm #{@age} years old."
  end
  
  # Getter methods (could also use attr_reader)
  def name
    @name
  end
  
  def age
    @age
  end
  
  # Setter methods (could also use attr_writer)
  def name=(new_name)
    @name = new_name
  end
  
  def age=(new_age)
    @age = new_age
  end
end

# Creating an instance
person = Person.new("Ruby", 25)
puts person.introduce  # Outputs: Hi, I'm Ruby and I'm 25 years old.
puts person.name       # Outputs: Ruby

# Modifying attributes
person.name = "Crystal"
puts person.name       # Outputs: Crystal
```

### 6. Explain attribute accessors in Ruby.

**Answer:** Ruby provides convenient macros for creating getter and setter methods:

```ruby
class Product
  # attr_reader creates getter methods
  attr_reader :id
  
  # attr_writer creates setter methods
  attr_writer :price
  
  # attr_accessor creates both getter and setter methods
  attr_accessor :name, :description
  
  def initialize(id, name, description, price)
    @id = id
    @name = name
    @description = description
    @price = price
  end
end

product = Product.new(1, "Laptop", "Powerful computer", 999.99)

# Using getter methods
puts product.id          # Outputs: 1
puts product.name        # Outputs: Laptop

# Using setter methods
product.name = "Desktop"
product.price = 1299.99

# Can't use product.price (no getter created with attr_writer)
```

### 7. What is inheritance in Ruby? How is it implemented?

**Answer:** Inheritance allows a class to inherit attributes and methods from another class:

```ruby
class Animal
  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
  end
  
  def speak
    "Some generic animal sound"
  end
  
  def name
    @name
  end
end

class Dog < Animal  # Dog inherits from Animal
  def speak
    "Woof!"  # Overriding the speak method
  end
  
  def fetch
    "#{@name} fetches the ball!"  # New method specific to Dog
  end
end

# Using the parent class
animal = Animal.new("Generic Animal")
puts animal.name   # Outputs: Generic Animal
puts animal.speak  # Outputs: Some generic animal sound

# Using the child class
dog = Dog.new("Rex")
puts dog.name      # Outputs: Rex (inherited method)
puts dog.speak     # Outputs: Woof! (overridden method)
puts dog.fetch     # Outputs: Rex fetches the ball! (new method)
```

### 8. How do you implement multiple inheritance in Ruby?

**Answer:** Ruby doesn't support true multiple inheritance, but it provides modules and mixins to achieve similar functionality:

```ruby
module Swimmable
  def swim
    "#{self.class} is swimming!"
  end
  
  def dive
    "#{self.class} is diving deep!"
  end
end

module Flyable
  def fly
    "#{self.class} is flying high!"
  end
end

class Bird
  def speak
    "Tweet!"
  end
end

class Duck < Bird
  include Swimmable  # Mixin the Swimmable module
  include Flyable    # Mixin the Flyable module
end

duck = Duck.new
puts duck.speak  # Outputs: Tweet! (from Bird class)
puts duck.swim   # Outputs: Duck is swimming! (from Swimmable module)
puts duck.fly    # Outputs: Duck is flying high! (from Flyable module)
```

## Ruby Specifics

### 9. What are blocks, Procs, and lambdas in Ruby?

**Answer:** These are all ways to create and use closures in Ruby, but with subtle differences:

```ruby
# Block (cannot be saved to a variable)
[1, 2, 3].each do |num|
  puts num * 2
end

# Alternative block syntax with curly braces
[1, 2, 3].each { |num| puts num * 2 }

# Proc (more relaxed about parameters)
square = Proc.new { |x| x * x }
puts square.call(5)      # Outputs: 25
puts square.call(5, 2)   # Outputs: 25 (extra arguments ignored)
puts square.call         # Outputs: nil (missing arguments become nil)

# Lambda (strict about parameters)
cube = lambda { |x| x * x * x }
puts cube.call(3)        # Outputs: 27
# puts cube.call         # Would raise ArgumentError

# Alternative lambda syntax (stabby lambda)
cube = ->(x) { x * x * x }
puts cube.call(3)        # Outputs: 27

# Differences in return behavior
def proc_return_test
  my_proc = Proc.new { return "Returned from proc!" }
  my_proc.call
  return "This line never executes"
end

def lambda_return_test
  my_lambda = -> { return "Returned from lambda!" }
  my_lambda.call
  return "This line executes!"
end

puts proc_return_test    # Outputs: Returned from proc!
puts lambda_return_test  # Outputs: This line executes!
```

### 10. Explain Ruby's method visibility: public, private, and protected.

**Answer:** Ruby offers three levels of method visibility:

```ruby
class BankAccount
  def initialize(name, balance)
    @name = name
    @balance = balance
  end
  
  # Public methods (default) - accessible from anywhere
  def account_summary
    "Account: #{@name}, Balance: $#{@balance}"
  end
  
  # Protected methods - accessible by instances of the same class or subclasses
  protected
  
  def balance
    @balance
  end
  
  def compare_balance(other_account)
    if self.balance > other_account.balance
      "#{@name}'s account has more funds"
    else
      "#{other_account.instance_variable_get(:@name)}'s account has more funds"
    end
  end
  
  # Private methods - only accessible within the class itself
  private
  
  def generate_account_number
    "AC-#{rand(100000..999999)}"
  end
end

# Usage example
account1 = BankAccount.new("Alice", 5000)
account2 = BankAccount.new("Bob", 3000)

puts account1.account_summary  # Accessible (public)
# puts account1.balance        # Error! Protected method
# puts account1.generate_account_number  # Error! Private method

# Defining a method to demonstrate protected method usage
class BankAccount
  def compare_with(other_account)
    compare_balance(other_account)  # Can call protected method
  end
end

puts account1.compare_with(account2)  # Works through public interface
```

## Advanced Ruby Concepts

### 11. What is metaprogramming in Ruby?

**Answer:** Metaprogramming is writing code that writes or manipulates code at runtime. Ruby has powerful metaprogramming capabilities:

```ruby
# Example 1: define_method to dynamically create methods
class Product
  ATTRIBUTES = [:name, :price, :category]
  
  attr_accessor *ATTRIBUTES
  
  def initialize(attributes = {})
    attributes.each do |key, value|
      send("#{key}=", value) if ATTRIBUTES.include?(key)
    end
  end
  
  # Dynamically define methods for each attribute
  ATTRIBUTES.each do |attribute|
    define_method("#{attribute}_info") do
      value = send(attribute)
      "The #{attribute} is #{value}"
    end
  end
end

laptop = Product.new(name: "MacBook", price: 1299, category: "Electronics")
puts laptop.name_info      # Outputs: The name is MacBook
puts laptop.price_info     # Outputs: The price is 1299

# Example 2: method_missing to handle nonexistent methods
class DataRecord
  def initialize(data = {})
    @data = data
  end
  
  def method_missing(name, *args)
    if name.to_s =~ /^find_by_(.+)$/
      key = $1.to_sym
      value = args.first
      
      @data.select { |record| record[key] == value }
    else
      super
    end
  end
  
  def respond_to_missing?(name, include_private = false)
    name.to_s.start_with?('find_by_') || super
  end
end

records = DataRecord.new([
  {id: 1, name: "Alice", role: "Developer"},
  {id: 2, name: "Bob", role: "Designer"},
  {id: 3, name: "Charlie", role: "Developer"}
])

puts records.find_by_role("Developer").inspect
# Outputs: [{:id=>1, :name=>"Alice", :role=>"Developer"}, 
#           {:id=>3, :name=>"Charlie", :role=>"Developer"}]
```

### 12. What are Ruby Gems? How do you create one?

**Answer:** Ruby Gems are packaged Ruby applications or libraries that can be distributed and installed easily.

Creating a simple gem involves:

```ruby
# File structure for a gem named "hello_world"
# hello_world/
# ├── lib/
# │   └── hello_world.rb
# ├── test/
# │   └── test_hello_world.rb
# ├── README.md
# ├── LICENSE.txt
# └── hello_world.gemspec

# Content of lib/hello_world.rb
module HelloWorld
  class Greeter
    def self.hello(name = "World")
      "Hello, #{name}!"
    end
  end
end

# Content of hello_world.gemspec
Gem::Specification.new do |s|
  s.name        = 'hello_world'
  s.version     = '0.0.1'
  s.summary     = "Hello World!"
  s.description = "A simple hello world gem"
  s.authors     = ["Your Name"]
  s.email       = 'your.email@example.com'
  s.files       = ["lib/hello_world.rb"]
  s.homepage    = 'https://rubygems.org/gems/hello_world'
  s.license     = 'MIT'
end

# Build and install the gem
# $ gem build hello_world.gemspec
# $ gem install ./hello_world-0.0.1.gem

# Using the gem
# require 'hello_world'
# puts HelloWorld::Greeter.hello("Ruby")  # Outputs: Hello, Ruby!
```

### 13. Explain Ruby's garbage collection.

**Answer:** Ruby uses automatic memory management through garbage collection:

- Ruby's garbage collector identifies and frees memory occupied by objects that are no longer referenced
- It uses a mark-and-sweep algorithm (with incremental and generational improvements in newer versions)
- Developers rarely need to manually manage memory in Ruby
- GC can be triggered manually with `GC.start` but is generally handled automatically

```ruby
# Example showing garbage collection
def create_many_objects
  1000.times do |i|
    # Create temporary objects that will be eligible for garbage collection
    "String #{i}" * 1000
  end
end

# Check memory usage before
memory_before = `ps -o rss= -p #{Process.pid}`.to_i
puts "Memory before: #{memory_before} KB"

# Create objects
create_many_objects

# Force garbage collection
GC.start

# Check memory after garbage collection
memory_after = `ps -o rss= -p #{Process.pid}`.to_i
puts "Memory after: #{memory_after} KB"
puts "Difference: #{memory_after - memory_before} KB"
```

## Ruby on Rails Questions

### 14. What is Ruby on Rails?

**Answer:** Ruby on Rails (often just "Rails") is a popular web application framework written in Ruby that follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern. It emphasizes convention over configuration and includes tools that make common development tasks easier.

Key components and principles include:

- **MVC Architecture:** Separates business logic, data, and user interface concerns
- **Convention over Configuration:** Sensible defaults reduce the need for explicit configuration
- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself):** Encourages code reuse
- **Active Record:** ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) for database interactions
- **Action View:** Template system for generating HTML
- **Action Controller:** Handles incoming web requests
- **Active Support:** Utility classes and extensions to Ruby
- **Bundled Tools:** Includes testing frameworks, database migrations, and scaffolding

### 15. What is the difference between `include` and `extend` in Ruby?

**Answer:** Both `include` and `extend` incorporate modules into classes, but in different ways:

```ruby
module Greetings
  def say_hello
    "Hello from #{self}!"
  end
end

# Using include (adds methods as instance methods)
class Person
  include Greetings
end

# Using extend (adds methods as class methods)
class Company
  extend Greetings
end

# Instance method demonstration
person = Person.new
puts person.say_hello  # Outputs: Hello from #<Person:0x...>!
# puts Person.say_hello  # Error! Not a class method

# Class method demonstration
puts Company.say_hello  # Outputs: Hello from Company!
# company = Company.new
# puts company.say_hello  # Error! Not an instance method

# You can use both together
class Team
  include Greetings  # For instances
  extend Greetings   # For the class itself
end

team = Team.new
puts Team.say_hello    # Outputs: Hello from Team!
puts team.say_hello    # Outputs: Hello from #<Team:0x...>!
```

## Real-World Problem Solving

### 16. How would you remove duplicates from an array in Ruby?

**Answer:** Ruby offers several ways to remove duplicates:

```ruby
# Using the built-in uniq method
array = [1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 4, 5, 4]
unique_array = array.uniq
puts unique_array.inspect  # Outputs: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# In-place modification
array = [1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 4, 5, 4]
array.uniq!
puts array.inspect  # Outputs: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Using a Set
require 'set'
array = [1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 4, 5, 4]
unique_array = array.to_set.to_a
puts unique_array.inspect  # Outputs: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Custom implementation (for demonstration)
def remove_duplicates(array)
  result = []
  seen = {}
  
  array.each do |item|
    unless seen[item]
      result << item
      seen[item] = true
    end
  end
  
  result
end

array = [1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 4, 5, 4]
puts remove_duplicates(array).inspect  # Outputs: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

### 17. Write a method to check if a string is a palindrome.

**Answer:** A palindrome reads the same backward as forward:

```ruby
# Simple palindrome checker
def palindrome?(string)
  # Normalize the string: lowercase and remove non-alphanumeric characters
  normalized = string.downcase.gsub(/[^a-z0-9]/, '')
  
  # Compare with its reverse
  normalized == normalized.reverse
end

# Test cases
puts palindrome?("racecar")                   # Outputs: true
puts palindrome?("A man, a plan, a canal: Panama")  # Outputs: true
puts palindrome?("hello")                     # Outputs: false

# Alternative one-liner
def palindrome_oneliner?(string)
  s = string.downcase.gsub(/[^a-z0-9]/, '')
  s == s.reverse
end
```

### 18. How would you implement a simple API client in Ruby?

**Answer:** Here's a basic implementation using Ruby's standard libraries:

```ruby
require 'net/http'
require 'uri'
require 'json'

class ApiClient
  def initialize(base_url, options = {})
    @base_url = base_url
    @headers = options[:headers] || {}
    @timeout = options[:timeout] || 30
  end
  
  def get(endpoint, params = {})
    uri = build_uri(endpoint, params)
    request = Net::HTTP::Get.new(uri)
    add_headers(request)
    
    perform_request(uri, request)
  end
  
  def post(endpoint, body = {})
    uri = build_uri(endpoint)
    request = Net::HTTP::Post.new(uri)
    request.body = body.to_json
    request.content_type = 'application/json'
    add_headers(request)
    
    perform_request(uri, request)
  end
  
  private
  
  def build_uri(endpoint, params = {})
    uri = URI.join(@base_url, endpoint)
    
    if params && !params.empty?
      uri.query = URI.encode_www_form(params)
    end
    
    uri
  end
  
  def add_headers(request)
    @headers.each do |key, value|
      request[key] = value
    end
  end
  
  def perform_request(uri, request)
    http = Net::HTTP.new(uri.host, uri.port)
    http.use_ssl = (uri.scheme == 'https')
    http.open_timeout = @timeout
    http.read_timeout = @timeout
    
    response = http.request(request)
    
    if response.is_a?(Net::HTTPSuccess)
      JSON.parse(response.body) rescue response.body
    else
      { error: response.message, code: response.code, body: response.body }
    end
  end
end

# Example usage:
weather_client = ApiClient.new('https://api.weather.example', 
                              headers: { 'API-Key' => 'your-api-key' })

# GET request
forecast = weather_client.get('/forecast', { city: 'New York', days: 3 })
puts forecast.inspect

# POST request
new_user = weather_client.post('/users', { name: 'John', email: 'john@example.com' })
puts new_user.inspect
```

## Performance and Optimization

### 19. How would you profile a Ruby application?

**Answer:** Ruby offers several tools for profiling applications:

1. **Using built-in Benchmark module:**

```ruby
require 'benchmark'

def slow_method
  sleep(0.1)
  "result"
end

def fast_method
  "result"
end

# Simple benchmarking
Benchmark.bm do |x|
  x.report("slow:") { 10.times { slow_method } }
  x.report("fast:") { 10.times { fast_method } }
end

# Memory profiling with memory_profiler gem
# require 'memory_profiler'
# report = MemoryProfiler.report do
#   100.times { slow_method }
# end
# report.pretty_print
```

2. **Using Ruby's built-in profiler:**

```ruby
require 'profile'

def complex_calculation
  result = 0
  1000.times do |i|
    result += i ** 2
  end
  result
end

# This will run with profiling enabled
complex_calculation
```

3. **Using external tools:**
   - ruby-prof gem
   - stackprof gem
   - rack-mini-profiler for web applications

### 20. Explain the difference between Symbols and Strings in Ruby.

**Answer:** Symbols and Strings are both text representations but have different characteristics:

```ruby
# Memory efficiency
require 'benchmark'

str_time = Benchmark.realtime do
  100_000.times do |i|
    "string_#{i}".object_id
  end
end

sym_time = Benchmark.realtime do
  100_000.times do |i|
    :"symbol_#{i}".object_id
  end
end

puts "String time: #{str_time}"
puts "Symbol time: #{sym_time}"

# Immutability
string = "hello"
symbol = :hello

string.upcase!
puts string  # Outputs: HELLO (strings are mutable)

# Symbols are immutable
# symbol.upcase!  # Would raise NoMethodError

# Object Identity
string1 = "hello"
string2 = "hello"
puts string1.object_id == string2.object_id  # Outputs: false (different objects)

symbol1 = :hello
symbol2 = :hello
puts symbol1.object_id == symbol2.object_id  # Outputs: true (same object)

# Memory Usage
require 'objspace'

strings = []
symbols = []

1000.times do
  strings << "hello"
  symbols << :hello
end

puts "1000 strings size: #{ObjectSpace.memsize_of(strings)} bytes"
puts "1000 symbols size: #{ObjectSpace.memsize_of(symbols)} bytes"
```

Key differences:
- Symbols are immutable, strings are mutable
- Identical symbols are a single object in memory, identical strings are different objects
- Symbols are more memory-efficient when reused
- Strings are better for text manipulation
- Symbols are commonly used for hash keys, method names, and identifiers
