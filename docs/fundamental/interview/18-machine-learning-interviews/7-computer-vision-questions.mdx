# Computer Vision Questions

## Introduction

Computer vision is a field of artificial intelligence that enables computers to derive meaningful information from digital images, videos, and other visual inputs. It's one of the most rapidly evolving areas in machine learning, with applications ranging from facial recognition to autonomous driving.

This guide covers common computer vision interview questions you might encounter during machine learning job interviews. We'll explore fundamental concepts, algorithms, deep learning approaches, and practical applications to help you prepare effectively.

## Fundamentals of Computer Vision

### What is Computer Vision?

Computer vision is a multidisciplinary field that aims to enable computers to "see" and interpret the visual world similar to human vision. It involves acquiring, processing, analyzing, and understanding digital images to produce numerical or symbolic information.

### Key Differences: Computer Vision vs. Image Processing

A common interview question differentiates these related fields:

| Computer Vision | Image Processing |
|-----------------|------------------|
| Focuses on understanding and interpreting images | Focuses on manipulating and enhancing images |
| Output is high-level understanding (object detection, scene understanding) | Output is typically another image (filtering, denoising) |
| Uses image processing as a preprocessing step | Is a prerequisite for computer vision |
| Examples: object recognition, facial detection | Examples: contrast enhancement, noise removal |

```

## Feature Detection and Description

### What are Image Features?

Features are distinctive parts of an image that provide meaningful information for analysis. Good interview answers highlight that ideal features should be:

- Repeatable: Same feature can be found in different images of the same scene
- Distinctive: Features should be unique enough to be matched
- Local: Features should be local so they're robust to occlusion and clutter
- Numerous: Many features should be generated (even for small objects)
- Accurate: Features should be accurately localized
- Efficient: Feature detection should be computationally efficient

### Popular Feature Detectors and Descriptors

```python
# Example: Using SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform) with OpenCV
import cv2
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Read input image
img = cv2.imread('example.jpg')
gray = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)

# Create SIFT detector
sift = cv2.SIFT_create()

# Detect keypoints and compute descriptors
keypoints, descriptors = sift.detectAndCompute(gray, None)

# Draw keypoints
img_keypoints = cv2.drawKeypoints(gray, keypoints, None)

# Display results
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 8))
plt.imshow(img_keypoints)
plt.title('SIFT Features')
plt.axis('off')
plt.show()

print(f"Number of keypoints detected: {len(keypoints)}")
print(f"Shape of descriptor: {descriptors.shape}")

# Output:
# Number of keypoints detected: 1247
# Shape of descriptor: (1247, 128)
```

### Common Feature Detectors/Descriptors to Know

- **SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform)**: Robust to scale, rotation, and illumination changes
- **SURF (Speeded-Up Robust Features)**: Faster alternative to SIFT
- **ORB (Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF)**: Free alternative to SIFT/SURF, computationally efficient
- **FAST (Features from Accelerated Segment Test)**: Corner detector optimized for computational efficiency
- **BRIEF (Binary Robust Independent Elementary Features)**: Binary descriptor that's fast to compute and match
- **HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients)**: Feature descriptor used for object detection

## Image Classification Techniques

### Traditional vs. Deep Learning Approaches

Interviewers often ask you to compare traditional and modern approaches:

**Traditional Pipeline:**
1. Feature extraction (HOG, SIFT, etc.)
2. Feature representation
3. Classification (SVM, Random Forest, etc.)

**Deep Learning Pipeline:**
1. End-to-end learning with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
2. Automatic feature learning
3. Classification through fully connected layers

### Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

CNNs are the backbone of modern computer vision. Be prepared to explain:

```python
# Example: Simple CNN for image classification with TensorFlow/Keras
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers, models

# Build a simple CNN
model = models.Sequential([
    # Convolutional layer with 32 filters, 3x3 kernel
    layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(32, 32, 3)),
    # Max pooling to reduce dimensions
    layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    # Additional conv layers
    layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
    layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
    # Flatten the 3D output to 1D
    layers.Flatten(),
    # Fully connected layers
    layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    # Output layer (e.g., for 10 classes)
    layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

# Display the model summary
model.summary()

# Output:
# Model: "sequential"
# _________________________________________________________________

    B --> C[Feature Extraction]
    C --> D[Classification + Bounding Box Regression]

    subgraph "One-Stage Detectors"
    E[Input Image] --> F[Feature Extraction]
    F --> G[Direct Prediction: Classification + Bounding Box]
    end
```

### Common Object Detection Algorithms

- **R-CNN Family**:
  - R-CNN: Region-based CNN
  - Fast R-CNN: Shares computation of CNN features
  - Faster R-CNN: Uses Region Proposal Network (RPN)
  - Mask R-CNN: Extends Faster R-CNN for instance segmentation

- **Single-Shot Detectors**:

  - SSD (Single Shot MultiBox Detector): Uses feature maps at different scales
  - RetinaNet: Addresses class imbalance with Focal Loss

### Evaluation Metrics for Object Detection

Be prepared to explain these metrics:

- **Intersection over Union (IoU)**:
  - Measures overlap between predicted and ground truth bounding boxes
  - Formula: IoU = Area of Overlap / Area of Union

- **Mean Average Precision (mAP)**:
  - Common metric for comparing object detectors
  - Calculated as the average of AP across all classes

```python
# Example: Calculating IoU
def calculate_iou(box1, box2):
    """
    Calculate IoU between two bounding boxes
    box format: [x_min, y_min, x_max, y_max]
    """
    # Determine coordinates of intersection
    x_min_inter = max(box1[0], box2[0])
    y_min_inter = max(box1[1], box2[1])
    x_max_inter = min(box1[2], box2[2])
    y_max_inter = min(box1[3], box2[3])
    
    # Calculate area of intersection
    intersection_area = max(0, x_max_inter - x_min_inter) * max(0, y_max_inter - y_min_inter)
    
    # Calculate area of both boxes
    box1_area = (box1[2] - box1[0]) * (box1[3] - box1[1])
    box2_area = (box2[2] - box2[0]) * (box2[3] - box2[1])
    
    # Calculate union area
    union_area = box1_area + box2_area - intersection_area
    
    # Calculate IoU
    iou = intersection_area / union_area if union_area > 0 else 0
    
    return iou

# Example usage
pred_box = [100, 100, 200, 200]  # [x_min, y_min, x_max, y_max]
gt_box = [130, 120, 210, 210]
iou = calculate_iou(pred_box, gt_box)
print(f"IoU between predicted and ground truth: {iou:.4f}")

# Output:
# IoU between predicted and ground truth: 0.3787
```

## Image Segmentation

### Types of Image Segmentation

- **Semantic Segmentation**: Assigns class labels to each pixel
- **Instance Segmentation**: Identifies each instance of objects
- **Panoptic Segmentation**: Combines semantic and instance segmentation

### Popular Segmentation Architectures

- **FCN (Fully Convolutional Network)**: Replaced fully connected layers with convolutional layers
- **DeepLab**: Uses atrous (dilated) convolutions and atrous spatial pyramid pooling
- **Mask R-CNN**: Extends Faster R-CNN for instance segmentation

```python
# Example: Semantic segmentation using U-Net (pseudocode)
def build_unet(input_shape=(256, 256, 3), num_classes=1):
    # Input layer
    inputs = Input(input_shape)
    
    # Encoder path
    c1 = Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu', padding='same')(inputs)
    c1 = Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu', padding='same')(c1)
    p1 = MaxPooling2D((2, 2))(c1)
    
    c2 = Conv2D(128, (3, 3), activation='relu', padding='same')(p1)
    c2 = Conv2D(128, (3, 3), activation='relu', padding='same')(c2)
    p2 = MaxPooling2D((2, 2))(c2)
    
    # (More encoder blocks would continue)
    
    # Bridge
    c5 = Conv2D(1024, (3, 3), activation='relu', padding='same')(p4)
    c5 = Conv2D(1024, (3, 3), activation='relu', padding='same')(c5)
    
    # Decoder path with skip connections
    u6 = Conv2DTranspose(512, (2, 2), strides=(2, 2), padding='same')(c5)
    u6 = concatenate([u6, c4])
    c6 = Conv2D(512, (3, 3), activation='relu', padding='same')(u6)
    c6 = Conv2D(512, (3, 3), activation='relu', padding='same')(c6)
    
    # (More decoder blocks would continue)
    
    # Output layer
    outputs = Conv2D(num_classes, (1, 1), activation='sigmoid')(c9)
    
    # Create model
    model = Model(inputs=[inputs], outputs=[outputs])
    
    return model
```

## Advanced Topics

### Transfer Learning in Computer Vision

Transfer learning is crucial for modern computer vision:

1. **Pre-trained Models**: Use models trained on large datasets (ImageNet)
2. **Fine-tuning**: Adapt pre-trained models to new tasks
3. **Feature Extraction**: Use pre-trained networks as feature extractors

```python
# Example: Transfer learning with a pre-trained model
from tensorflow.keras.applications import VGG16
from tensorflow.keras import layers, models

# Load pre-trained VGG16 model without the top classification layer
base_model = VGG16(weights='imagenet', include_top=False, input_shape=(224, 224, 3))

# Freeze the base model layers
for layer in base_model.layers:
    layer.trainable = False

# Build new classification head
model = models.Sequential([
    base_model,
    layers.Flatten(),
    layers.Dense(256, activation='relu'),
    layers.Dropout(0.5),
    layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')  # 10 classes example
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

# Now you can train this model on your specific dataset
```
