# Load Balancing

## Introduction

Load balancing is a critical concept in computer networks that distributes incoming network traffic across multiple servers or resources. Think of it as the traffic controller at a busy intersection, directing vehicles to ensure no single road becomes congested. In computing, load balancers help maintain application availability, reliability, and scalability by preventing any single server from becoming a bottleneck.

As websites and applications grow in popularity, a single server often can't handle all the traffic. Load balancing solves this problem by intelligently distributing requests across a group of backend servers, also known as a server pool or server farm.

## Why Load Balancing Matters

Load balancing provides several key benefits:

- **High Availability**: If one server fails, the load balancer redirects traffic to the remaining online servers
- **Scalability**: You can easily add or remove servers as demand changes
- **Efficiency**: Optimizes resource use, maximizes throughput, and minimizes response time
- **Security**: Some load balancers provide security features like DDoS protection

## How Load Balancing Works

At a fundamental level, load balancers sit between client devices and backend servers, receiving and then distributing incoming requests to any available server capable of fulfilling them.

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Client] --> B[Load Balancer]
    B --> C[Server 1]
    B --> D[Server 2]
    B --> E[Server 3]
    style B fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

When a load balancer receives a request, it must decide which server should handle it. This decision is made using various algorithms, which we'll explore next.

## Load Balancing Algorithms

The method used to distribute traffic across servers is determined by load balancing algorithms. Here are the most common ones:

### Round Robin

The simplest method, rotating requests across the server group in sequential order.

```javascript
class RoundRobinLoadBalancer {
    constructor(servers) {
        this.servers = servers;
        this.currentIndex = 0;
    }
    
    getNextServer() {
        // Select the next server
        const server = this.servers[this.currentIndex];
        
        // Increment the index
        this.currentIndex = (this.currentIndex + 1) % this.servers.length;
        
        return server;
    }
}

// Example usage
const servers = ['server1', 'server2', 'server3'];
const loadBalancer = new RoundRobinLoadBalancer(servers);

console.log(loadBalancer.getNextServer()); // Output: server1
console.log(loadBalancer.getNextServer()); // Output: server2
console.log(loadBalancer.getNextServer()); // Output: server3
console.log(loadBalancer.getNextServer()); // Output: server1 (starts over)
```

### Least Connections

Directs traffic to the server with the fewest active connections, useful when requests may require varying processing time.

```javascript
class LeastConnectionsLoadBalancer {
    constructor(servers) {
        // Initialize each server with 0 connections
        this.serverConnections = {};
        servers.forEach(server => {
            this.serverConnections[server] = 0;
        });
    }
    
    getNextServer() {
        // Find server with least connections
        let minConnections = Infinity;
        let selectedServer = null;
        
        for (const [server, connections] of Object.entries(this.serverConnections)) {
            if (connections < minConnections) {
                minConnections = connections;
                selectedServer = server;
            }
        }
        
        // Increment connection count for selected server
        this.serverConnections[selectedServer]++;
        
        return selectedServer;
    }
    
    closeConnection(server) {
        // Decrement connection count when a connection completes
        if (this.serverConnections[server] > 0) {
            this.serverConnections[server]--;
        }
    }
}
```

### IP Hash

Uses the client's IP address to determine which server receives the request, ensuring that a client is consistently directed to the same server.

```javascript
class IpHashLoadBalancer {
    constructor(servers) {
        this.servers = servers;
    }
    
    getServerForIp(ipAddress) {
        // Simple hash function for the IP address
        const hash = this.hashIp(ipAddress);
        
        // Use the hash to determine server index
        const serverIndex = hash % this.servers.length;
        
        return this.servers[serverIndex];
    }
    
    hashIp(ipAddress) {
        // Simple hash function (in real implementations, more robust algorithms are used)
        let hash = 0;
        for (let i = 0; i < ipAddress.length; i++) {
            hash = (hash * 31 + ipAddress.charCodeAt(i)) & 0xFFFFFFFF;
        }
        return Math.abs(hash);
    }
}

// Example usage
const servers = ['server1', 'server2', 'server3'];
const loadBalancer = new IpHashLoadBalancer(servers);

console.log(loadBalancer.getServerForIp('192.168.1.1')); // Output: server2 (example)
console.log(loadBalancer.getServerForIp('192.168.1.2')); // Output: server1 (example)
console.log(loadBalancer.getServerForIp('192.168.1.1')); // Output: server2 (same as first call)
```

### Weighted Round Robin

Similar to Round Robin but assigns different weights to servers based on their capacity or performance.

```javascript
class WeightedRoundRobinLoadBalancer {
    constructor(serverWeights) {
        this.serverWeights = serverWeights; // { serverName: weight }
        this.currentIndex = 0;
        this.servers = [];
        
        // Create array with servers repeated according to their weights
        for (const [server, weight] of Object.entries(serverWeights)) {
            for (let i = 0; i < weight; i++) {
                this.servers.push(server);
            }
        }
    }
    
    getNextServer() {
        const server = this.servers[this.currentIndex];
        this.currentIndex = (this.currentIndex + 1) % this.servers.length;
        return server;
    }
}

// Example usage
const serverWeights = {
    'server1': 5,  // Higher weight, gets more traffic
    'server2': 3,
    'server3': 1   // Lower weight, gets less traffic
};

const loadBalancer = new WeightedRoundRobinLoadBalancer(serverWeights);
```

### Least Response Time

Directs traffic to the server with the lowest response time, which indicates the fastest server.

## Types of Load Balancers

Load balancers operate at different layers of the OSI network model:

### Layer 4 Load Balancing (Transport Layer)

- Makes routing decisions based on IP address and TCP/UDP ports
- Simple and efficient but lacks application awareness
- Lower overhead since it doesn't inspect packet content

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Client Request] --> B[Layer 4 Load Balancer]
    B -->|TCP/IP Info| C[Routing Decision]
    C --> D[Server 1]
    C --> E[Server 2]
    C --> F[Server 3]
```

### Layer 7 Load Balancing (Application Layer)

- Makes decisions based on content of the request (HTTP headers, URLs, cookies)
- More intelligent routing but higher overhead
- Can perform SSL termination, handle HTTP requests directly

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Client Request] --> B[Layer 7 Load Balancer]
    B -->|Analyze HTTP Headers, URL, Content| C[Routing Decision]
    C -->|Static Content| D[CDN/Static Servers]
    C -->|API Requests| E[API Servers]
    C -->|Database Queries| F[Database Servers]
```

## Load Balancer Implementation Examples

Let's look at how to implement a simple load balancer in Node.js:

```javascript
const http = require('http');
const httpProxy = require('http-proxy');

// Create a proxy server
const proxy = httpProxy.createProxyServer({});

// List of backend servers
const backends = [
  { host: 'localhost', port: 3001 },
  { host: 'localhost', port: 3002 },
  { host: 'localhost', port: 3003 }
];

let currentBackendIndex = 0;

// Create the load balancer server
const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  // Get the next backend using Round Robin
  const backend = backends[currentBackendIndex];
  
  // Update the index for the next request
  currentBackendIndex = (currentBackendIndex + 1) % backends.length;
  
  // Proxy the request to the selected backend
  proxy.web(req, res, { 
    target: `http://${backend.host}:${backend.port}`
  });
});

// Handle proxy errors
proxy.on('error', (err, req, res) => {
  console.error('Proxy error:', err);
  res.writeHead(500, { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' });
  res.end('Proxy error');
});

// Start the server on port 80
server.listen(80, () => {
  console.log('Load balancer running on port 80');
});
```

## Real-World Load Balancing Solutions

### Hardware Load Balancers

Physical devices dedicated to load balancing, often used in enterprise environments:
- F5 BIG-IP
- Citrix ADC (formerly NetScaler)
- A10 Networks

### Software Load Balancers

Software implementations that can run on standard hardware:
- NGINX
- HAProxy
- Apache Traffic Server

### Cloud Load Balancing Services

Managed services provided by cloud providers:
- AWS Elastic Load Balancing (ELB)
- Google Cloud Load Balancing
- Azure Load Balancer

Let's look at how to configure a simple NGINX load balancer:

```nginx
http {
    upstream backend {
        # Round Robin is the default algorithm
        server backend1.example.com;
        server backend2.example.com;
        server backend3.example.com;
        
        # For Least Connections, uncomment:
        # least_conn;
        
        # For IP Hash, uncomment:
        # ip_hash;
    }
    
    server {
        listen 80;
        server_name example.com;
        
        location / {
            proxy_pass http://backend;
            proxy_set_header Host $host;
            proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        }
    }
}
```

## Session Persistence and Sticky Sessions

Sometimes it's important for a client to consistently connect to the same backend server, particularly for applications that maintain session state. This is accomplished through:

### Sticky Sessions

The load balancer uses cookies or other mechanisms to route a client to the same server for subsequent requests.

```nginx
upstream backend {
    server backend1.example.com;
    server backend2.example.com;
    
    # Enable sticky sessions based on IP
    ip_hash;
    
    # Alternative: cookie-based stickiness
    # sticky cookie srv_id expires=1h domain=.example.com path=/;
}
```

### Session Replication

Session data is replicated across all servers, so any server can handle any request regardless of which server handled previous requests.

## Load Balancer Health Checks

To maintain high availability, load balancers regularly check the health of backend servers:

```javascript
class LoadBalancerWithHealthChecks {
    constructor(servers, checkInterval = 5000) {
        this.servers = servers;
        this.healthyServers = [...servers];
        this.currentIndex = 0;
        
        // Start health checks
        setInterval(() => this.performHealthChecks(), checkInterval);
    }
    
    async performHealthChecks() {
        this.healthyServers = [];
        
        for (const server of this.servers) {
            try {
                const healthy = await this.checkServerHealth(server);
                if (healthy) {
                    this.healthyServers.push(server);
                }
            } catch (error) {
                console.error(`Health check failed for ${server}:`, error);
            }
        }
        
        console.log(`Healthy servers: ${this.healthyServers.length}/${this.servers.length}`);
    }
    
    async checkServerHealth(server) {
        // In a real implementation, this would make an HTTP request to a health endpoint
        // Simplified example:
        return new Promise((resolve) => {
            // Simulate a health check with 90% success rate
            const healthy = Math.random() < 0.9;
            setTimeout(() => resolve(healthy), 100);
        });
    }
    
    getNextServer() {
        if (this.healthyServers.length === 0) {
            throw new Error("No healthy servers available");
        }
        
        const server = this.healthyServers[this.currentIndex];
        this.currentIndex = (this.currentIndex + 1) % this.healthyServers.length;
        return server;
    }
}
```

## Global Server Load Balancing (GSLB)

GSLB extends load balancing across multiple data centers, providing:
- Geographic distribution of traffic
- Disaster recovery capabilities
- Reduced latency by directing users to the nearest data center

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Users Worldwide] --> B[DNS with GSLB]
    B -->|US Users| C[US Data Center]
    B -->|Europe Users| D[European Data Center]
    B -->|Asia Users| E[Asian Data Center]
    
    subgraph "US Data Center"
    C --> F[Local Load Balancer]
    F --> G[Server Pool]
    end
    
    subgraph "European Data Center"
    D --> H[Local Load Balancer]
    H --> I[Server Pool]
    end
    
    subgraph "Asian Data Center"
    E --> J[Local Load Balancer]
    J --> K[Server Pool]
    end
```

## Summary
