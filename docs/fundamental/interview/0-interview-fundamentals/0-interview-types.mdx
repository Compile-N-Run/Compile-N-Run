// Problem: Write a function to find the first non-repeating character in a string.
// Input: "programming"
// Output: "p" (p is the first character that doesn't repeat)

function firstNonRepeatingChar(str) {
  // Create a map to store character frequencies
  const charCount = {};
  
  // Count characters
  for (const char of str) {
    charCount[char] = (charCount[char] || 0) + 1;
  }
  
  // Find first character with count of 1
  for (const char of str) {
    if (charCount[char] === 1) {
      return char;
    }
  }
  
  // No non-repeating character found
  return null;
}

console.log(firstNonRepeatingChar("programming")); // "p"
console.log(firstNonRepeatingChar("aabbcc")); // null
console.log(firstNonRepeatingChar("aabbc")); // "c"
```

### 3. Behavioral Interviews

Behavioral interviews focus on your soft skills, past experiences, and how you might fit into the company culture.

      // File might not exist yet, start with empty tasks
      this.tasks = [];
    }
  }

  saveTasks() {
    fs.writeFileSync(this.dataFile, JSON.stringify(this.tasks, null, 2));
  }

  addTask(description, dueDate = null) {
    const task = {
      id: Date.now(),
      description,
      completed: false,
      createdAt: new Date().toISOString(),
      dueDate
    };
    
    this.tasks.push(task);
    this.saveTasks();
    console.log(`Task added: ${description}`);
  }

  listTasks() {
    if (this.tasks.length === 0) {
      console.log("No tasks found.");
      return;
    }
    
    console.log("
Your Tasks:");
    this.tasks.forEach((task, index) => {
      const status = task.completed ? "✓" : "☐";
      const due = task.dueDate ? `(Due: ${task.dueDate})` : "";
      console.log(`${index + 1}. ${status} ${task.description} ${due}`);
    });
  }

  markAsDone(taskIndex) {
    if (taskIndex < 0 || taskIndex >= this.tasks.length) {
      console.log("Invalid task number.");
      return;
    }
    
    this.tasks[taskIndex].completed = true;
    this.saveTasks();
    console.log(`Task "${this.tasks[taskIndex].description}" marked as done.`);
  }

  deleteTask(taskIndex) {
    if (taskIndex < 0 || taskIndex >= this.tasks.length) {
      console.log("Invalid task number.");
      return;
    }
    
    const removed = this.tasks.splice(taskIndex, 1);
    this.saveTasks();
    console.log(`Task "${removed[0].description}" deleted.`);
  }
}

// Usage example
const app = new TodoApp();
