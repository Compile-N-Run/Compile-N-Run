# Ansible Tower Installation

## Introduction

Ansible Tower (now part of Red Hat Automation Platform) is a web-based solution that makes Ansible more accessible to teams by providing a user interface, role-based access control, job scheduling, and graphical inventory management. It's essentially a centralized hub for your automation tasks.

This guide will walk you through the process of installing Ansible Tower in your environment, from prerequisites to verification. By the end, you'll have a working Ansible Tower instance ready to streamline your automation workflows.

## Prerequisites

Before installing Ansible Tower, ensure your system meets these requirements:

- A 64-bit Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 8/9, CentOS 8/9, or equivalent
- Minimum 4GB RAM (8GB+ recommended for production)
- Minimum 20GB disk space
- 2+ CPU cores
- A valid Red Hat subscription or trial license for Ansible Tower
- Python 3.6 or later
- Internet connectivity for downloading packages

## Installation Methods

There are three primary methods to install Ansible Tower:

    A[Installation Methods] --> B[Bundled Installer]
    A --> C[Ansible Playbook]
    A --> D[Container/Kubernetes]
    
    B --> E[Simplest method
Includes all dependencies]
    C --> F[Customizable
Requires Ansible knowledge]
    D --> G[Scalable
Cloud-native approach]
```

We'll focus on the bundled installer method as it's the most straightforward for beginners.

## Step-by-Step Installation Process

### 1. Download the Installer

First, download the latest Ansible Tower installer package:

```bash
# Create a directory for the installer
mkdir ~/ansible-tower-install
cd ~/ansible-tower-install

# Download the latest bundle (replace X.Y.Z with the current version)
curl -O https://releases.ansible.com/ansible-tower/setup/ansible-tower-setup-latest.tar.gz

# Extract the package
tar -xvzf ansible-tower-setup-latest.tar.gz

# Move into the extracted directory
cd ansible-tower-setup-*
```

### 2. Configure the Installation

Next, edit the `inventory` file to customize your installation:

```bash
# Make a backup of the original inventory file
cp inventory inventory.bak

# Edit the inventory file
vi inventory
```

Here's what a basic `inventory` file looks like:

```ini
[tower]
localhost ansible_connection=local

[database]
localhost ansible_connection=local

[all:vars]
admin_password='YourAdminPassword'
pg_password='YourDatabasePassword'
secret_key='YourRandomSecretKey'
```

Adjust these values:
- `admin_password`: The password for the Tower admin user
- `pg_password`: The password for the PostgreSQL database
- `secret_key`: A random string used for encryption (should be at least 32 characters)

### 3. Run the Installation

Now, execute the setup script:

```bash
sudo ./setup.sh
```

This process can take 15-30 minutes depending on your system's performance and internet connection. The installer will:

1. Install dependencies
2. Configure PostgreSQL
3. Set up the Tower application
4. Configure NGINX as a web server
5. Start all necessary services

The output will look similar to:

```
PLAY RECAP *********************************************************************
localhost                  : ok=142  changed=61   unreachable=0    failed=0
```

If you see `failed=0`, your installation was successful!

### 4. Verify Installation

Open a web browser and navigate to your server's address:

```
https://your-server-ip
```

You should see the Ansible Tower login page. Log in with:
- Username: `admin`
- Password: The `admin_password` you set in the inventory file

## Advanced Installation Options

### Using an External Database

For production environments, you might want to use an external database server:

```ini
[tower]
tower.example.com

[database]
db.example.com

[all:vars]
admin_password='YourAdminPassword'
pg_password='YourDatabasePassword'
pg_host='db.example.com'
pg_port='5432'
pg_database='tower'
pg_username='tower'
secret_key='YourRandomSecretKey'
```

### Clustered Installation

For high availability, Tower supports clustered deployments:

```ini
[tower]
tower1.example.com
tower2.example.com
tower3.example.com

[database]
db.example.com

[all:vars]
admin_password='YourAdminPassword'
pg_password='YourDatabasePassword'
pg_host='db.example.com'
pg_port='5432'
pg_database='tower'
pg_username='tower'
secret_key='YourRandomSecretKey'
```

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Installation Fails with PostgreSQL Errors

If you encounter database-related errors:

```bash
# Ensure PostgreSQL is running
sudo systemctl status postgresql

# Check if another PostgreSQL instance is installed
ps aux | grep postgres
```

### Web Interface Not Accessible

If you can't access the web interface:

```bash
# Check if Tower services are running
sudo ansible-tower-service status

# Check for firewall issues
sudo firewall-cmd --list-all

# Add http/https to allowed services if needed
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=https
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=http
sudo firewall-cmd --reload
```

### License Issues

If you see license-related errors:

1. Go to **Settings** > **System** > **License**
2. Upload your license file or enter your subscription information
3. Save the changes

## Post-Installation Configuration

After successful installation, you should:

1. **Update your license** - Upload your Red Hat license or start a trial
2. **Configure authentication** - Set up LDAP, SAML, or other authentication methods
3. **Create organizations** - Logical groupings for your teams
4. **Set up inventories** - Define where your automation will run
5. **Add credentials** - Securely store connection information
6. **Create projects** - Connect to your Ansible repositories

## Example: Basic Setup After Installation

Let's create a simple inventory and run a ping test:

1. **Create an inventory**:
   - Navigate to **Inventories** > **Add**
   - Name: "Web Servers"
   - Organization: "Default"
   - Save

2. **Add a host**:
   - In your inventory, click **Hosts** > **Add**
   - Name: "webserver1.example.com"
   - Save

3. **Create a credential**:
   - Navigate to **Credentials** > **Add**
   - Name: "Server SSH Key"
   - Credential Type: "Machine"
   - SSH Private Key: Paste your private key
   - Save

4. **Create a project**:
   - Navigate to **Projects** > **Add**
   - Name: "Sample Project"
   - SCM Type: "Git"
   - SCM URL: "https://github.com/ansible/ansible-examples.git"
   - Save

5. **Create a job template**:
   - Navigate to **Templates** > **Add** > **Job Template**
   - Name: "Ping Test"
   - Inventory: "Web Servers"
   - Project: "Sample Project"
   - Playbook: "ping.yml"
   - Credentials: "Server SSH Key"
   - Save
   - Launch the job

## Upgrading Ansible Tower

When a new version becomes available, the upgrade process is similar to installation:

```bash
# Download the new version
curl -O https://releases.ansible.com/ansible-tower/setup/ansible-tower-setup-latest.tar.gz

# Extract and navigate to the directory
tar -xvzf ansible-tower-setup-latest.tar.gz
cd ansible-tower-setup-*

# Copy your old inventory file (optional)
cp /path/to/old/inventory ./inventory

# Run the setup script
sudo ./setup.sh
```
