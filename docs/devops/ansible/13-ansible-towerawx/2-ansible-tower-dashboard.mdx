# Ansible Tower Dashboard

## Introduction

The Ansible Tower Dashboard (also known as the AWX Dashboard in the open-source version) is the primary interface for managing and monitoring your automation infrastructure. It provides a centralized web-based console where administrators and operators can control, schedule, and track automation jobs across their entire environment. For beginners entering the world of infrastructure automation, the dashboard serves as your command center for all Ansible operations.

## Dashboard Overview

When you first log into Ansible Tower, you're presented with the dashboard - a comprehensive visual representation of your automation environment's health and activity. The dashboard is designed to give you at-a-glance information about your automation status while providing quick access to common tasks.

## Key Dashboard Components

### 1. Job Status Widget

The Job Status widget provides a visual summary of all job activities across your environment.

#### Components:

- **Success/Failure Ratio**: A pie chart showing the proportion of successful vs. failed jobs
- **Recent Activity Timeline**: Displays job execution over time
- **Failed Jobs Spotlight**: Highlights problematic automation to address

### 2. Recent Jobs Widget

This section lists the most recently run automation jobs, including:

- Job name
- Template source
- Status (success, failed, running)
- Start and end times
- Initiated by (user)

This area allows you to quickly identify who is running what in your environment and troubleshoot recent failures.

### 3. Host Status Widget

The Host Status widget displays the current state of the hosts managed by Tower:

- **Total Hosts**: Count of all managed hosts
- **Host Status Breakdown**: Shows how many hosts are:
  - OK/Green (healthy)
  - Warning/Yellow (issues detected)
  - Error/Red (failed or unreachable)

### 4. Quick Navigation

The dashboard includes shortcuts to your most important resources:

- **Templates**: Predefined job configurations
- **Inventories**: Lists of managed hosts
- **Projects**: Ansible playbook repositories
- **Credentials**: Authentication details for managed systems

## Customizing Your Dashboard

Ansible Tower allows you to customize the dashboard to focus on what matters most to your operations.

2. Recent Jobs limited to critical service deployments
3. Host Status focused on production servers

### Example 2: Team Activity Monitoring

For a team lead tracking automation adoption:

1. Configure the Recent Jobs widget to show all team member activities
2. Add the "Most Active Users" widget to track engagement
3. Monitor template usage statistics to identify popular automation

### Example 3: Dashboard for Incident Response

During an incident:

1. Filter Recent Jobs to show only related system components
2. Add Host Status widgets for affected service groups
3. Create quick access shortcuts to incident response playbooks

## Deep Dive: Dashboard Navigation and Features
