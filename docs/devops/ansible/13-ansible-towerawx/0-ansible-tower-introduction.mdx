# Ansible Tower Introduction

## What is Ansible Tower?

Ansible Tower (now known as Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform) is a web-based solution that makes Ansible more accessible to teams by providing a user interface, role-based access control, job scheduling, integrated notifications, and graphical inventory management. It is the commercial offering from Red Hat, while AWX is the upstream open-source project that Tower is built from.

Think of Ansible Tower as a control center for your Ansible automation:

```

## Why Use Ansible Tower?

If you're already familiar with Ansible, you might wonder why you need Tower. Here are some compelling reasons:

1. **Centralized UI**: Tower provides a graphical interface to manage playbooks, inventories, and job runs.
2. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Control who can access what in your automation infrastructure.
3. **Job Scheduling**: Schedule playbooks to run at specific times.
4. **Real-time Job Status Updates**: Monitor automation jobs in real-time.
5. **Credential Management**: Securely store and manage sensitive credentials.
6. **RESTful API**: Integrate Ansible automation with other tools and services.
7. **Workflow Builder**: Create complex workflows by chaining multiple playbooks together.

## Ansible Tower vs. AWX

Before diving deeper, let's clarify an important distinction:

| Feature | Ansible Tower | AWX |
|---------|---------------|-----|
| License | Commercial (Paid) | Open Source (Free) |
| Support | Official Red Hat Support | Community Support |
| Stability | Enterprise-ready, Stable | Latest Features, Potentially Less Stable |
| Updates | Regular, Scheduled | Frequent |

AWX is the upstream project for Ansible Tower. Think of the relationship between Fedora and Red Hat Enterprise Linux â€“ AWX is where new features are developed before they make their way into the stable Tower release.

## Tower Architecture

Ansible Tower has a straightforward architecture that consists of several key components:

```mermaid

    E -->|Uses| I[Message Queue]
```

The key components include:
- **Web UI**: The graphical interface users interact with
- **REST API**: The backbone that allows integration with other systems
- **Database**: Stores projects, inventories, credentials, and results
- **Task Engine**: Coordinates job execution
- **Ansible Core**: The actual Ansible engine that executes playbooks

## Getting Started with Ansible Tower

### Installation Options

There are several ways to install Ansible Tower:

1. **Bundle Installation**: The simplest method for standalone servers
2. **Distributed Installation**: For larger environments requiring high availability
3. **OpenShift/Kubernetes Installation**: Deploy Tower on container platforms

For beginners, the bundle installation is recommended. Here's a simplified example of the process:

```bash
# Download the latest Tower bundle
wget https://releases.ansible.com/ansible-tower/setup/ansible-tower-setup-latest.tar.gz

# Extract the bundle
tar xvf ansible-tower-setup-latest.tar.gz
cd ansible-tower-setup-<version>

# Edit the inventory file to configure Tower
vi inventory

# Run the setup script
./setup.sh
```

The inventory file requires configuration of these basic parameters:

```ini
[tower]
localhost ansible_connection=local

[database]
localhost ansible_connection=local

[all:vars]
admin_password='your_password_here'
pg_password='your_pg_password_here'
secret_key='your_secret_key_here'
```

### Exploring the Tower Interface

After installation, you can access Tower at `https://<your-tower-server>`. Upon first login, you'll see the dashboard:

1. **Dashboard**: Shows recent job activity and status
2. **Projects**: Where you manage your Ansible repositories
3. **Inventories**: Define and manage the hosts you automate
4. **Templates**: Create job and workflow templates
5. **Credentials**: Securely store authentication information
6. **Organizations**: Group users and teams logically
7. **Users**: Manage user accounts and permissions

## Working with Tower: Basic Concepts

### Managing Projects

Projects in Tower are collections of Ansible Playbooks. Here's how to create one:

1. Navigate to **Projects** > **Add**
2. Fill out the form:
   - Name: `Example Project`
   - Organization: Select your organization
   - SCM Type: Git (most common)
   - SCM URL: `https://github.com/yourusername/your-ansible-repo.git`
   - SCM Branch: `main`
   - Update Options: Select as needed

Once created, Tower will sync with your repository and make the playbooks available.

### Creating Inventories

Inventories define the hosts and groups to run your playbooks against:

1. Navigate to **Inventories** > **Add**
2. Fill out the form:
   - Name: `Production Servers`
   - Organization: Select your organization
3. Save the inventory
4. Add hosts by clicking on **Hosts** > **Add**:
   - Host Name: `web1.example.com`
   - Variables (YAML):
     ```yaml
     ansible_host: 192.168.1.101
     server_role: webserver
     ```

### Managing Credentials

Credentials allow Tower to authenticate with your infrastructure:

1. Navigate to **Credentials** > **Add**
2. Fill out the form:
   - Name: `Production SSH Key`
   - Organization: Select your organization
   - Credential Type: Machine
   - SSH Private Key: Paste your key or use a file
   - Privilege Escalation Method: sudo (if needed)

### Creating Job Templates

Job Templates combine projects, inventories, and credentials to create runnable jobs:

1. Navigate to **Templates** > **Add** > **Job Template**
2. Fill out the form:
   - Name: `Deploy Web Application`
   - Job Type: Run
   - Inventory: `Production Servers`
   - Project: `Example Project`
   - Playbook: Select a playbook from the dropdown
   - Credentials: `Production SSH Key`
   - Extra Variables (if needed):
     ```yaml
     app_version: 1.2.3
     deploy_mode: rolling
     ```

Once saved, you can run the template by clicking the rocket icon.

### Workflow Templates

For more complex automation scenarios, Workflow Templates allow you to chain multiple job templates together:

1. Navigate to **Templates** > **Add** > **Workflow Template**
2. Fill out the basic information
3. Click **Save** and then **Workflow Editor**
4. Use the visual editor to add nodes and define the workflow:
   - Add job templates as nodes
   - Connect them with success/failure paths
   - Add approval nodes for human intervention when needed

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Automated Server Provisioning

Let's say you want to automate the provisioning of web servers. Here's how you might set it up in Tower:

1. Create a Project linked to a Git repo containing your provisioning playbooks
2. Set up an Inventory for your cloud provider
3. Configure cloud Credentials
4. Create a Job Template that runs your `provision_webserver.yml` playbook
5. Set up a Survey to capture variables like:
   - Number of servers
   - Server size/flavor
   - Environment (dev/test/prod)

Now users can provision servers by simply filling out a form, without needing to understand the underlying Ansible code.

### Example 2: Compliance Enforcement

For organizations with strict compliance requirements:

1. Create a Project containing compliance-checking playbooks
2. Set up an Inventory with all systems requiring compliance checks
3. Create a Job Template that runs your compliance playbooks
4. Schedule the Job Template to run nightly
5. Configure notifications to alert security teams of non-compliant systems
6. Create a remediation Workflow Template that:
   - Identifies non-compliant systems
   - Applies necessary fixes
   - Verifies the fixes were successful
   - Generates compliance reports

### Example 3: Application Deployment Pipeline

Create a complete CI/CD pipeline using Tower:

1. Set up a Workflow Template with the following nodes:
   - Run application tests
   - Deploy to staging environment
   - Run integration tests on staging
   - Approval node requiring manual confirmation
   - Deploy to production environment
   - Verify production deployment
   - Send notification of successful deployment

Connect this workflow to your CI system (like Jenkins or GitLab CI) using Tower's API to automatically trigger deployments when new code is pushed.

## Tower API and Automation

Tower provides a comprehensive RESTful API that allows you to integrate with other systems and automate Tower itself. Here's a simple example using Python to launch a job template:

```python
import requests
import json

# Tower connection details
TOWER_URL = "https://tower.example.com"
TOWER_USERNAME = "admin"
TOWER_PASSWORD = "password"

# Get an authentication token
response = requests.post(
    f"{TOWER_URL}/api/v2/tokens/",
    auth=(TOWER_USERNAME, TOWER_PASSWORD),
    verify=False  # Only for testing, use proper certificate verification in production
)

token = response.json()["token"]
headers = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {token}", "Content-Type": "application/json"}

# Launch a job template by ID
job_template_id = 42
response = requests.post(
    f"{TOWER_URL}/api/v2/job_templates/{job_template_id}/launch/",
    headers=headers,
    data=json.dumps({"extra_vars": {"deploy_environment": "production"}})
)

# Get the job ID from the response
job_id = response.json()["job"]
print(f"Job launched: {TOWER_URL}/#/jobs/playbook/{job_id}")

# Monitor the job status
while True:
    job_response = requests.get(
        f"{TOWER_URL}/api/v2/jobs/{job_id}/",
        headers=headers
    )
    status = job_response.json()["status"]
    print(f"Job status: {status}")
    
    if status in ["successful", "failed", "error", "canceled"]:
        break
    
    time.sleep(5)
```

## Best Practices

To get the most out of Ansible Tower:

1. **Use Source Control**: Always store your playbooks in a git repository.
2. **Implement RBAC Properly**: Carefully plan your roles and permissions.
3. **Use Surveys**: They make templates more user-friendly and reduce errors.
4. **Create Templates for Everything**: Even simple tasks benefit from standardization.
5. **Set Up Notifications**: Keep stakeholders informed of automation results.
