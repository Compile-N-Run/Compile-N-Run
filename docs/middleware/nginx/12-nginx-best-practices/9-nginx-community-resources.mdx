```

## Example: Contributing to Nginx Community

Let's look at a simple example of how you might contribute to the Nginx community by sharing a useful configuration snippet:

```nginx
# Enhanced security headers configuration
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name example.com;
    
    # Redirect all HTTP traffic to HTTPS
    return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
}

server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name example.com;
    
    ssl_certificate /etc/nginx/ssl/example.com.crt;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/nginx/ssl/example.com.key;
    
    # Security headers
    add_header Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains" always;
    add_header X-Content-Type-Options "nosniff" always;
    add_header X-Frame-Options "SAMEORIGIN" always;
    add_header X-XSS-Protection "1; mode=block" always;
    add_header Content-Security-Policy "default-src 'self';" always;
    
    location / {
        root /var/www/html;
        index index.html;
    }
}
```

After testing this configuration, you could share it on:
1. GitHub as a gist

    content_by_lua_block {
        ngx.say("<p>Hello, OpenResty!</p>")
    }
}
```
