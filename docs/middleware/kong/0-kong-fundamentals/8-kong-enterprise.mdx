### Installation with Docker

Here's a step-by-step guide to set up Kong Enterprise with Docker:

1. Create a `docker-compose.yml` file:

```yaml
version: '3.7'

services:
  kong-database:
    image: postgres:13
    container_name: kong-database
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: kong
      POSTGRES_DB: kong
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: kong
    ports:
      - "5432:5432"
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "pg_isready", "-U", "kong"]
      interval: 5s
      timeout: 5s
      retries: 5

  kong-migrations:
    image: kong/kong-gateway:3.0.0.0-enterprise
    command: "kong migrations bootstrap"
    depends_on:
      - kong-database
    environment:
      KONG_DATABASE: postgres
      KONG_PG_HOST: kong-database
      KONG_PG_USER: kong
      KONG_PG_PASSWORD: kong
      KONG_LICENSE_DATA: ${KONG_LICENSE_DATA}

  kong:
    image: kong/kong-gateway:3.0.0.0-enterprise
    container_name: kong
    depends_on:
      - kong-database
      - kong-migrations
    environment:
      KONG_DATABASE: postgres
      KONG_PG_HOST: kong-database
      KONG_PG_USER: kong
      KONG_PG_PASSWORD: kong
      KONG_PROXY_ACCESS_LOG: /dev/stdout
      KONG_ADMIN_ACCESS_LOG: /dev/stdout

      - "8003:8003" # Dev Portal
      - "8446:8446" # Dev Portal SSL
```

2. Export your Kong Enterprise license as an environment variable:

```bash
export KONG_LICENSE_DATA='{"license":{"payload":{"admin_seats":"5","customer":"Example Company","dataplanes":"5","license_creation_date":"2023-01-01","license_expiration_date":"2024-01-01","license_key":"00141000000000000000000000000000","product_subscription":"Kong Enterprise Edition","support_plan":"None"},"signature":"example_signature_here","version":"1"}}'
```

3. Start Kong Enterprise:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

4. Verify the installation by accessing Kong Manager at `http://localhost:8002`

### Creating Your First Service and Route

Let's create a service and a route to a mock API:

1. Create a Service:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/services \
  --data name=example-service \
  --data url=https://mockbin.org
```

This will output something like:

```json
{
  "id": "a5a3108f-c654-4d83-8d12-9f0be773646d",
  "name": "example-service",
  "protocol": "https",
  "host": "mockbin.org",
  "port": 443,
  "path": null,
  "created_at": 1646757242,
  "updated_at": 1646757242,
  "retries": 5,
  "connect_timeout": 60000,
  "write_timeout": 60000,
  "read_timeout": 60000
}
```

2. Create a Route:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/services/example-service/routes \
  --data name=example-route \
  --data paths[]=/example
```

This will output:

```json
{
  "id": "d9535eda-653b-4806-8cb6-5f0b0c2643f6",
  "name": "example-route",
  "protocols": ["http", "https"],
  "methods": null,
  "hosts": null,
  "paths": ["/example"],
  "https_redirect_status_code": 426,
  "regex_priority": 0,
  "strip_path": true,
  "preserve_host": false,
  "tags": null,
  "service": {
    "id": "a5a3108f-c654-4d83-8d12-9f0be773646d"
  },
  "created_at": 1646757298,
  "updated_at": 1646757298
}
```

3. Test the Route:

```bash
curl -i http://localhost:8000/example
```

You should receive a response from mockbin.org.

## Advanced Features

### Implementing Rate Limiting

Let's add rate limiting to our API to prevent abuse:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/services/example-service/plugins \
  --data name=rate-limiting \
  --data config.minute=5 \
  --data config.policy=local
```

This configures our service to allow only 5 requests per minute. Let's test it:

```bash
for i in {1..10}; do
  curl -i http://localhost:8000/example
  echo ""
done
```

After the 5th request, you'll see responses with status code 429 (Too Many Requests).

### Setting Up the Developer Portal

Kong Enterprise's Developer Portal allows you to publish your APIs for developers. Here's how to set it up:

1. Enable the Developer Portal if not already enabled:

```bash
curl -X PATCH http://localhost:8001/workspaces/default \
  --data config.portal=true
```

2. Create a Developer Portal file:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/files \
  --data type=spec \
  --data contents='{"openapi":"3.0.0","info":{"title":"Example API","version":"1.0.0","description":"This is an example API"},"paths":{"/example":{"get":{"summary":"Example endpoint","responses":{"200":{"description":"OK"}}}}}}'
```

3. Visit the Developer Portal at `http://localhost:8003`

### Implementing Authentication

Kong Enterprise offers various authentication plugins. Let's add key authentication:

1. Enable the key-auth plugin:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/services/example-service/plugins \
  --data name=key-auth \
  --data config.key_names=apikey
```

2. Create a consumer:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/consumers \
  --data username=example-user
```

3. Create a key for the consumer:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/consumers/example-user/key-auth \
  --data key=example-key
```

4. Test the authentication:

```bash
# This should fail
curl -i http://localhost:8000/example

# This should succeed
curl -i http://localhost:8000/example?apikey=example-key
```

## Enterprise Plugin Showcase

Kong Enterprise comes with exclusive plugins not available in the open-source version. Let's look at a few important ones:

### OpenID Connect

The OpenID Connect plugin allows you to integrate with identity providers:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/services/example-service/plugins \
  --data name=openid-connect \
  --data config.issuer=https://auth.example.com/.well-known/openid-configuration \
  --data config.client_id=your-client-id \
  --data config.client_secret=your-client-secret \
  --data config.scopes=openid,email,profile
```

### Request Transformer Advanced

This plugin offers enhanced request transformation capabilities:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/services/example-service/plugins \
  --data name=request-transformer-advanced \
  --data config.add.headers=x-enterprise-header:enterprise-value
```

### Canary Release

The Canary Release plugin allows for gradual traffic shifting:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/routes/example-route/plugins \
  --data name=canary \
  --data config.percentage=20 \
  --data config.upstream_host=new-version.example.com \
  --data config.upstream_port=443 \
  --data config.upstream_protocol=https
```

## Best Practices for Kong Enterprise

1. **Use Workspaces**: Organize your APIs by teams or departments using Kong's workspace feature.

```bash
# Create a new workspace
curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/workspaces \
  --data name=team-a
```

2. **Implement RBAC**: Use role-based access control to limit what users can do.

```bash
# Create a role
curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/rbac/roles \
  --data name=api-admin

# Create a user
curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/admins \
  --data username=alice \
  --data email=alice@example.com \
  --data password=secret

# Assign the role to the user
curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/rbac/users/alice/roles \
  --data roles=api-admin
```

3. **Set Up Health Checks**: Ensure your upstream services are monitored.

```bash
curl -X PATCH http://localhost:8001/upstreams/example-upstream \
  --data healthchecks.active.healthy.interval=5 \
  --data healthchecks.active.unhealthy.interval=5
```

4. **Monitor with Kong Vitals**: Keep an eye on your API traffic and performance.

5. **Use Tags**: Organize your Kong entities with tags for easier management.

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/services \
  --data name=payment-service \
  --data url=https://payment.example.com \
  --data tags=financial,critical
```
