# Kong CI/CD Tools

## Introduction

Modern API development requires reliable, consistent deployment processes that can keep pace with rapid development cycles. Kong, a popular API gateway, offers several tools and approaches that integrate seamlessly with Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines.

In this guide, you'll learn how to implement automation for your Kong API Gateway configurations using CI/CD tools. This approach helps eliminate manual configuration errors, ensures consistency across environments, and accelerates the deployment of API changes.

## What is Kong API Gateway?

Before diving into CI/CD integration, let's briefly understand what Kong is:

Kong is an open-source API gateway that sits in front of your APIs, providing features like:

- Request routing
- Authentication
- Rate limiting
- Analytics
- Plugin ecosystem for extending functionality

Kong can be deployed as a standalone gateway or in Kubernetes environments, making it versatile for various architectures.

## Why Use CI/CD with Kong?

Implementing CI/CD for Kong configurations offers several benefits:

1. **Version Control**: Store Kong configurations as code (Infrastructure as Code)
2. **Automation**: Eliminate error-prone manual steps
3. **Consistency**: Ensure identical configurations across development, testing, and production
4. **Testing**: Validate changes before deployment
5. **Auditability**: Track who changed what and when
6. **Rollbacks**: Quickly revert to previous configurations if issues arise

## Key Kong CI/CD Tools

### 1. decK: Declarative Configuration for Kong

decK is an official tool from Kong that enables a GitOps approach to managing Kong configurations.

#### Installation

```bash
# MacOS
brew install kong/tap/deck

# Linux
curl -sL https://github.com/kong/deck/releases/latest/download/deck_linux_amd64.tar.gz | tar -xz -C /tmp
sudo cp /tmp/deck /usr/local/bin/
```

#### Basic Usage

Export existing Kong configuration:

```bash
deck dump --kong-addr http://localhost:8001 -o kong.yaml
```

This generates a YAML file containing your Kong configuration:

```yaml
_format_version: "1.1"
services:
- name: example-service
  url: http://example.com
  routes:
  - name: example-route
    paths:
    - /example
    strip_path: true
```

Apply configuration to Kong:

```bash
deck sync --kong-addr http://localhost:8001 -s kong.yaml
```

#### decK in CI/CD Pipeline

Here's how to integrate decK in a GitHub Actions workflow:

```yaml
name: Kong CI/CD

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
    paths:
      - 'kong/**'

jobs:
  deploy-kong-config:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      
      - name: Install decK
        run: |
          curl -sL https://github.com/kong/deck/releases/latest/download/deck_linux_amd64.tar.gz | tar -xz
          sudo mv deck /usr/local/bin/
      
      - name: Validate Kong configuration
        run: deck validate -s kong/kong.yaml
      
      - name: Deploy to Kong
        if: success()
        run: deck sync --kong-addr ${{ secrets.KONG_ADMIN_URL }} -s kong/kong.yaml
```

### 2. Inso CLI: API Testing and Validation

Inso CLI is part of the Kong Insomnia ecosystem and helps test APIs as part of your CI/CD pipeline.

#### Installation

```bash
# npm
npm install -g insomnia-inso

# yarn
yarn global add insomnia-inso
```

#### Running API Tests

Assuming you have Insomnia test suites exported:

```bash
# Run all test suites
inso run test "My API Tests"

# Run specific test
inso run test "My API Tests/Authentication Tests"
```

#### Inso in CI/CD Pipeline

```yaml
name: API Testing

on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  api-tests:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '16'
      
      - name: Install Inso CLI
        run: npm install -g insomnia-inso
      
      - name: Run API Tests
        run: inso run test "My API Tests" --env "Testing"
```

### 3. Kong Kubernetes Ingress Controller with GitOps

For Kubernetes environments, Kong provides a Kubernetes Ingress Controller that integrates with GitOps tools like Flux or ArgoCD.

#### Example Kong Ingress Resource

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: example-ingress
  annotations:
    konghq.com/strip-path: "true"
    konghq.com/plugins: rate-limiting
spec:
  ingressClassName: kong
  rules:
  - host: api.example.com
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /v1
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: example-service
            port:
              number: 80
```

#### Kong Plugin Custom Resource

```yaml
apiVersion: configuration.konghq.com/v1
kind: KongPlugin
metadata:
  name: rate-limiting
config:
  minute: 5
  policy: local
plugin: rate-limiting
```

## Building CI/CD Workflows for Kong

Let's design a complete CI/CD workflow for Kong configurations:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Developer Changes] --> B[Git Push]
    B --> C[Automated Tests]
    C --> D{Tests Pass?}
    D -->|Yes| E[Deploy to Dev]
    D -->|No| F[Notify Developer]
    E --> G[Integration Tests]
    G --> H{Tests Pass?}
    H -->|Yes| I[Deploy to Staging]
    H -->|No| F
    I --> J[Staging Tests]
    J --> K{Tests Pass?}
    K -->|Yes| L[Deploy to Production]
    K -->|No| F
    L --> M[Monitor Performance]
```

### Step-by-Step Implementation

#### 1. Version Control Setup

Store Kong configurations in a Git repository with this structure:

```
kong-config/
├── environments/
│   ├── dev/
│   │   └── kong.yaml
│   ├── staging/
│   │   └── kong.yaml
│   └── prod/
│       └── kong.yaml
├── plugins/
│   ├── rate-limiting.yaml
│   └── jwt-auth.yaml
└── services/
    ├── auth-service.yaml
    └── product-service.yaml
```

#### 2. Validation Pipeline

Create a pipeline that validates configuration changes before merging:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/validate.yml
name: Validate Kong Configuration

on:
  pull_request:
    paths:
      - 'kong-config/**'

jobs:
  validate:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      
      - name: Install decK
        run: |
          curl -sL https://github.com/kong/deck/releases/latest/download/deck_linux_amd64.tar.gz | tar -xz
          sudo mv deck /usr/local/bin/
      
      - name: Validate Dev Config
        run: deck validate -s kong-config/environments/dev/kong.yaml
      
      - name: Validate Staging Config
        run: deck validate -s kong-config/environments/staging/kong.yaml
      
      - name: Validate Prod Config
        run: deck validate -s kong-config/environments/prod/kong.yaml
```

#### 3. Deployment Pipeline

Create deployment workflows for each environment:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/deploy.yml
name: Deploy Kong Configuration

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
    paths:
      - 'kong-config/environments/dev/**'
      - 'kong-config/environments/staging/**'
      - 'kong-config/environments/prod/**'

jobs:
  deploy-dev:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      
      - name: Install decK
        run: |
          curl -sL https://github.com/kong/deck/releases/latest/download/deck_linux_amd64.tar.gz | tar -xz
          sudo mv deck /usr/local/bin/
      
      - name: Deploy to Dev
        run: |
          deck sync --kong-addr ${{ secrets.DEV_KONG_ADMIN_URL }} \
            -s kong-config/environments/dev/kong.yaml
  
  # Similar jobs for staging and production with appropriate conditions
```

## Advanced Kong CI/CD Patterns

### Blue-Green Deployments

Kong supports blue-green deployments for zero-downtime updates:

```bash
# Deploy to "blue" environment
deck sync --kong-addr http://kong-blue:8001 -s kong-new.yaml

# Test "blue" environment
# Run your tests against the blue environment

# Switch traffic from "green" to "blue"
# This could be done by updating a load balancer or DNS
```

### Canary Releases

Implement canary releases using Kong's traffic splitting capabilities:

```yaml
# In your Kong configuration
routes:
  - name: api-canary
    paths:
      - /api
    service: api-service-v2
    plugins:
      - name: canary
        config:
          percentage: 10  # Send 10% of traffic to v2
```

### Automated Rollbacks

Implement automated rollbacks if issues are detected:

```yaml
# In your deployment pipeline
- name: Monitor for errors
  run: |
    ./monitor-errors.sh
    if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
      deck sync --kong-addr ${{ secrets.KONG_ADMIN_URL }} -s kong-previous.yaml
      exit 1
    fi
```

## Common CI/CD Strategies for Kong

### Strategy 1: Environment Promotion

Move configurations through environments progressively:

1. Developer works on local environment
2. Changes are pushed to development
3. Once verified, promoted to staging
4. Finally deployed to production

### Strategy 2: Feature Branches

Use branch-based deployments:

1. Create feature branch for Kong changes
2. Automated deployment to ephemeral environment
3. Testing in isolated environment
4. Merge to main when approved
5. Deploy to permanent environments

## Practical Example: Complete CI/CD Pipeline for a Microservice API

Let's implement a complete example for a fictional product API:

### 1. Kong Configuration (kong.yaml)

```yaml
_format_version: "1.1"
services:
  - name: products-api
    url: http://products-service:8080
    routes:
      - name: products-route
        paths:
          - /products
    plugins:
      - name: rate-limiting
        config:
          minute: 60
          policy: local
      - name: key-auth
        config:
          key_names:
            - apikey
```

### 2. GitHub Actions Pipeline (.github/workflows/kong-deploy.yml)

```yaml
name: Kong API Gateway CI/CD

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
    paths:
      - 'kong/**'
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]
    paths:
      - 'kong/**'

jobs:
  validate:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      
      - name: Install decK
        run: |
          curl -sL https://github.com/kong/deck/releases/latest/download/deck_linux_amd64.tar.gz | tar -xz
          sudo mv deck /usr/local/bin/
      
      - name: Validate Kong configuration
        run: deck validate -s kong/kong.yaml

  deploy-dev:
    needs: validate
    if: github.event_name == 'push' && github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      
      - name: Install decK
        run: |
          curl -sL https://github.com/kong/deck/releases/latest/download/deck_linux_amd64.tar.gz | tar -xz
          sudo mv deck /usr/local/bin/
      
      - name: Deploy to Dev
        run: |
          deck sync --kong-addr ${{ secrets.DEV_KONG_ADMIN_URL }} \
            -s kong/kong.yaml
      
      - name: Verify Deployment
        run: |
          # Wait for changes to propagate
          sleep 5
          
          # Test the API gateway configuration
          curl -i -X GET ${{ secrets.DEV_API_URL }}/products \
            -H "apikey: ${{ secrets.DEV_API_KEY }}"
          
          # Check for expected status code
          STATUS=$(curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" \
            ${{ secrets.DEV_API_URL }}/products \
            -H "apikey: ${{ secrets.DEV_API_KEY }}")
          
          if [ $STATUS -ne 200 ]; then
            echo "Verification failed! Got status $STATUS"
            exit 1
          fi
```

## Best Practices for Kong CI/CD

1. **Keep Configurations Simple**: Break down complex configurations into manageable pieces
2. **Environment Variables**: Use environment-specific variables for endpoints, credentials, etc.
3. **Test Thoroughly**: Test all aspects of your API gateway before deploying
4. **Implement Monitoring**: Set up alerts for any Kong-related issues
5. **Documentation**: Keep documentation up-to-date with configuration changes
6. **Access Control**: Restrict who can make changes to Kong in production
7. **Regular Audits**: Periodically review Kong configurations for security issues

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue: Configuration Not Applying

**Solution**: Check Admin API access and permissions. Verify your Kong admin URL is correct and accessible from your CI/CD runner.

### Issue: Plugins Not Working

**Solution**: Verify the plugin is installed and enabled in Kong. Check plugin configuration syntax.

### Issue: Pipeline Failures

**Solution**: Run decK in verbose mode to see detailed error information:

```bash
deck sync --kong-addr http://localhost:8001 -s kong.yaml -v
```
