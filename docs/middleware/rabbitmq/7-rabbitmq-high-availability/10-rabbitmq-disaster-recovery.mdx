# RabbitMQ Disaster Recovery

## Introduction

Disaster recovery is a critical aspect of maintaining robust and reliable messaging infrastructure with RabbitMQ. When building systems that rely on message queues, you need to prepare for unexpected failures that could lead to data loss or service disruption. This guide will walk you through the essential disaster recovery strategies for RabbitMQ to ensure your messaging system remains resilient even in the face of catastrophic events.

Unlike high availability which focuses on maintaining service uptime during partial failures, disaster recovery addresses how to recover from complete system failures, data center outages, or other major incidents that can take down your entire RabbitMQ infrastructure.

## Understanding RabbitMQ Failure Scenarios

Before diving into recovery strategies, let's understand the types of failures that might occur:

### Types of Failures

1. **Node Failures**: Individual RabbitMQ node crashes due to hardware issues or software bugs
2. **Network Partitions**: Network problems causing cluster nodes to lose communication
3. **Data Corruption**: Corruption of message store or other RabbitMQ data
4. **Complete Outages**: Total loss of a data center or region where RabbitMQ is deployed
5. **Human Errors**: Accidental deletion of exchanges, queues, or configuration

Each type of failure requires different recovery approaches, which we'll explore throughout this guide.

## Essential Disaster Recovery Strategies

### 1. Regular Backups

The foundation of any disaster recovery plan is a consistent backup strategy.

#### Backup RabbitMQ Definitions

RabbitMQ definitions include exchanges, queues, bindings, users, virtual hosts, policies, and permissions. You can export these using the management plugin:

```bash
# Export all definitions
rabbitmqctl export_definitions /path/to/definitions.json

# Using HTTP API (if management plugin is enabled)
curl -u guest:guest http://localhost:15672/api/definitions > definitions.json
```

Here's what the output JSON might look like:

```json
{
  "rabbit_version": "3.8.9",
  "users": [
    {
      "name": "guest",
      "password_hash": "...",
      "hashing_algorithm": "rabbit_password_hashing_sha256",
      "tags": "administrator"
    }
  ],
  "vhosts": [
    {
      "name": "/"
    }
  ],
  "permissions": [
    {
      "user": "guest",
      "vhost": "/",
      "configure": ".*",
      "write": ".*",
      "read": ".*"
    }
  ],
  "queues": [
    {
      "name": "important_queue",
      "vhost": "/",
      "durable": true,
      "auto_delete": false,
      "arguments": {}
    }
  ],
  "exchanges": [
    {
      "name": "my_exchange",
      "vhost": "/",
      "type": "topic",
      "durable": true,
      "auto_delete": false,
      "internal": false,
      "arguments": {}
    }
  ],
  "bindings": [
    {
      "source": "my_exchange",
      "vhost": "/",
      "destination": "important_queue",
      "destination_type": "queue",
      "routing_key": "routing.key",
      "arguments": {}
    }
  ]
}
```

Schedule these exports regularly and store them securely, preferably in multiple locations.

#### Backing Up Message Data

The message store itself is more challenging to back up while the broker is running. The safest approach is:

1. **Scheduled Downtime**: Set maintenance windows for complete backups
2. **File System Backup**: Use file system snapshots or disk imaging tools
3. **Mnesia Database**: Back up the Mnesia database directory (usually in `/var/lib/rabbitmq/mnesia`)

```bash
# Example of a filesystem backup (should be done when RabbitMQ is stopped)
systemctl stop rabbitmq-server
tar -czf rabbitmq-data-backup.tar.gz /var/lib/rabbitmq
systemctl start rabbitmq-server
```

### 2. Implementing Message Persistence

Message persistence ensures that messages survive broker restarts.

#### Durable Exchanges and Queues

```javascript
// Node.js example with amqplib to create durable queues and exchanges
const amqp = require('amqplib');

async function setup() {
  const connection = await amqp.connect('amqp://localhost');
  const channel = await connection.createChannel();
  
  // Create durable exchange
  await channel.assertExchange('durable_exchange', 'topic', {
    durable: true
  });
  
  // Create durable queue
  await channel.assertQueue('durable_queue', {
    durable: true
  });
  
  // Bind them together
  await channel.bindQueue('durable_queue', 'durable_exchange', 'important.messages');
  
  console.log('Durable setup complete');
}

setup();
```

#### Persistent Messages

When publishing messages, set the `persistent` flag to ensure messages are written to disk:

```javascript
// Publishing persistent messages
await channel.publish('durable_exchange', 'important.messages', 
  Buffer.from('Critical message that must not be lost'), 
  {
    persistent: true  // This ensures the message is written to disk
  }
);
```

#### Publisher Confirms

For added reliability, enable publisher confirms:

```javascript
// Using publisher confirms
await channel.confirmSelect();

// Publish with promise to confirm delivery
const result = await new Promise((resolve) => {
  channel.publish('durable_exchange', 'important.messages',
    Buffer.from('Message with delivery confirmation'),
    { persistent: true },
    (err, ok) => resolve(!err)
  );
});

console.log(result ? 'Message confirmed' : 'Message failed');
```

### 3. Setting Up Geo-Redundant Clusters

For critical applications, set up RabbitMQ clusters across multiple geographic regions.

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Region A (Primary)"
        A1[RabbitMQ Node 1]
        A2[RabbitMQ Node 2]
        A3[RabbitMQ Node 3]
    end
    
    subgraph "Region B (Disaster Recovery)"
        B1[RabbitMQ Node 1]
        B2[RabbitMQ Node 2]
        B3[RabbitMQ Node 3]
    end
    
    A1 --- A2
    A2 --- A3
    A3 --- A1
    
    B1 --- B2
    B2 --- B3
    B3 --- B1
    
    S[Shovel Plugin] --> |Replicates Messages| B1
    A1 --> S
```

#### Using the Shovel Plugin for Cross-Region Replication

The Shovel plugin can transfer messages between separate RabbitMQ clusters:

```bash
# Enable the shovel plugin
rabbitmq-plugins enable rabbitmq_shovel
rabbitmq-plugins enable rabbitmq_shovel_management

# Configure a shovel in the rabbitmq.conf file or via the management UI
```

Example shovel configuration in your `rabbitmq.conf`:

```properties
# Define a shovel to move messages from primary to DR site
shovel.my-shovel.src-uri = amqp://user:pass@primary-site-host:5672
shovel.my-shovel.src-queue = important_queue
shovel.my-shovel.dest-uri = amqp://user:pass@dr-site-host:5672
shovel.my-shovel.dest-queue = important_queue_dr
```

Or configure a shovel using the management API:

```javascript
// Node.js example to create a shovel dynamically
const axios = require('axios');
const qs = require('querystring');

async function createShovel() {
  const shovelConfig = {
    "value": {
      "src-uri": "amqp://user:pass@primary-site:5672",
      "src-queue": "important_queue",
      "dest-uri": "amqp://user:pass@backup-site:5672",
      "dest-queue": "important_queue_dr"
    }
  };
  
  try {
    const response = await axios.put(
      'http://localhost:15672/api/parameters/shovel/%2F/disaster-recovery-shovel',
      JSON.stringify(shovelConfig),
      {
        headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
        auth: { username: 'guest', password: 'guest' }
      }
    );
    console.log('Shovel created successfully', response.data);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error creating shovel:', error.response?.data || error.message);
  }
}

createShovel();
```

### 4. Implementing a Recovery Plan

A comprehensive recovery plan involves several steps:

#### Step 1: Define Recovery Point Objective (RPO) and Recovery Time Objective (RTO)

- **RPO**: How much data loss is acceptable?
- **RTO**: How quickly must the system be restored?

#### Step 2: Document Recovery Procedures

Create a step-by-step recovery playbook:

1. Identify the failure type
2. Stop applications connecting to the failed cluster
3. Provision new infrastructure (if needed)
4. Restore RabbitMQ definitions
5. Restore message data (if available)
6. Validate the restored system
7. Redirect applications to the new/restored system

#### Step 3: Automate Recovery Where Possible

Here's a simple bash script template for automating RabbitMQ recovery:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# RabbitMQ Disaster Recovery Script

# Variables
BACKUP_DIR="/path/to/backups"
LATEST_BACKUP=$(ls -t $BACKUP_DIR/rabbitmq-data-*.tar.gz | head -1)
DEFINITIONS_FILE=$(ls -t $BACKUP_DIR/definitions-*.json | head -1)
RABBITMQ_DATA_DIR="/var/lib/rabbitmq"

# Stop RabbitMQ
echo "Stopping RabbitMQ..."
systemctl stop rabbitmq-server

# Restore data
echo "Restoring RabbitMQ data from $LATEST_BACKUP..."
rm -rf $RABBITMQ_DATA_DIR/*
tar -xzf $LATEST_BACKUP -C /

# Start RabbitMQ
echo "Starting RabbitMQ..."
systemctl start rabbitmq-server
sleep 10  # Give RabbitMQ time to start up

# Import definitions
echo "Importing definitions from $DEFINITIONS_FILE..."
rabbitmqctl import_definitions $DEFINITIONS_FILE

echo "Recovery complete. Please verify the system."
```

## Testing Your Disaster Recovery Plan

A recovery plan is only effective if it works when needed. Regular testing is crucial.

### Scheduled DR Drills

Conduct regular disaster recovery drills:

1. **Simulate Failures**: Intentionally trigger different failure scenarios
2. **Run Recovery Procedures**: Follow your playbook to restore the system
3. **Measure Recovery Time**: Track how long the recovery takes
4. **Validate Data Integrity**: Ensure no messages were lost or corrupted
5. **Update Procedures**: Refine your playbook based on findings

### Automated Testing

Create scripts to automate DR testing:

```python
# Python example for an automated DR test
import subprocess
import time
import requests
import json

def simulate_node_failure():
    """Simulate a node failure by stopping the service"""
    subprocess.run(["systemctl", "stop", "rabbitmq-server"])
    print("Node failure simulated")

def recover_node():
    """Run the recovery procedure"""
    start_time = time.time()
    
    # Run recovery script
    subprocess.run(["/path/to/recovery-script.sh"])
    
    # Wait for RabbitMQ to be fully operational
    while True:
        try:
            response = requests.get("http://localhost:15672/api/overview",
                                   auth=("guest", "guest"))
            if response.status_code == 200:
                break
        except:
            pass
        time.sleep(1)
    
    recovery_time = time.time() - start_time
    print(f"Recovery completed in {recovery_time:.2f} seconds")
    return recovery_time

def validate_system():
    """Check if the system is functioning correctly"""
    # Check queues existence
    response = requests.get("http://localhost:15672/api/queues",
                           auth=("guest", "guest"))
    queues = json.loads(response.text)
    
    expected_queues = ["important_queue", "notifications"]
    found_queues = [q["name"] for q in queues]
    
    for queue in expected_queues:
        if queue not in found_queues:
            print(f"ERROR: Queue {queue} missing after recovery")
            return False
    
    print("System validation passed")
    return True

# Run the test
simulate_node_failure()
recovery_time = recover_node()
validation_result = validate_system()

print(f"DR Test Result: {'SUCCESS' if validation_result else 'FAILED'}")
print(f"Recovery SLA: {recovery_time:.2f}s")
```

## Client-Side Disaster Recovery Strategies

Applications using RabbitMQ should also be prepared for broker failures.

### Implementing Retry Logic

Add exponential backoff retry logic to publishers and consumers:

```javascript
// JavaScript example with exponential backoff
async function connectWithRetry() {
  const maxRetries = 10;
  let retries = 0;
  
  while (retries < maxRetries) {
    try {
      console.log(`Attempt ${retries + 1} to connect to RabbitMQ`);
      const connection = await amqp.connect('amqp://localhost');
      console.log('Successfully connected to RabbitMQ');
      return connection;
    } catch (error) {
      retries++;
      if (retries >= maxRetries) {
        console.error('Max retries reached. Failed to connect to RabbitMQ');
        throw error;
      }
      
      // Exponential backoff
      const delay = Math.min(1000 * Math.pow(2, retries), 30000);
      console.log(`Connection failed. Retrying in ${delay}ms`);
      await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, delay));
    }
  }
}
```

### Message Deduplication

When recovering from failures, messages might be processed more than once. Implement deduplication:

```javascript
// Message deduplication example
const processedMessages = new Set();

// In your message consumer
function processMessage(msg) {
  const messageId = msg.properties.messageId;
  
  // Skip if already processed
  if (processedMessages.has(messageId)) {
    console.log(`Skipping duplicate message: ${messageId}`);
    channel.ack(msg);
    return;
  }
  
  // Process the message
  try {
    // Your processing logic here
    console.log("Processing message:", msg.content.toString());
    
    // Mark as processed
    processedMessages.add(messageId);
    
    // Clean up the set periodically to avoid memory leaks
    if (processedMessages.size > 10000) {
      // Remove oldest entries
      const iterator = processedMessages.values();
      for (let i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
        processedMessages.delete(iterator.next().value);
      }
    }
    
    channel.ack(msg);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error processing message:", error);
    channel.nack(msg);
  }
}
```

## Monitoring and Alerting for Disaster Prevention

Proactive monitoring helps detect issues before they become disasters.

### Key Metrics to Monitor

1. Queue length and growth rates
2. Message throughput
3. Message age in queue
4. Node memory and disk usage
5. Erlang VM health
6. Network latency between nodes

### Setting up Prometheus and Grafana

RabbitMQ can expose metrics for Prometheus:

```bash
# Enable Prometheus plugin
rabbitmq-plugins enable rabbitmq_prometheus
```

Here's a basic Prometheus configuration:

```yaml
# prometheus.yml
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'rabbitmq'
    scrape_interval: 5s
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['rabbitmq:15692']
```

With Grafana, you can create dashboards and alerts for these metrics:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[RabbitMQ] -->|metrics| B[Prometheus]
    B -->|visualization| C[Grafana]
    C -->|alerts| D[Alert Manager]
    D -->|notifications| E[DevOps Team]
```

## Practical Disaster Recovery Exercise

Let's work through a complete disaster recovery exercise:

### Scenario: Complete Broker Failure

1. **Setup**: 
   - A production RabbitMQ cluster with 3 nodes
   - Multiple applications sending critical business messages
   - Daily definition exports and nightly data backups

2. **Disaster**:
   - Complete hardware failure in the data center
   - All 3 RabbitMQ nodes are lost
   - Need to recover onto new hardware in another data center

3. **Recovery Procedure**:

```bash
# Step 1: Provision new servers in DR site
# (We assume this is done already)

# Step 2: Install RabbitMQ on new servers
apt-get update
apt-get install -y rabbitmq-server

# Step 3: Stop RabbitMQ to restore data
systemctl stop rabbitmq-server

# Step 4: Restore the data from backup
scp backup-server:/backups/rabbitmq-data-latest.tar.gz /tmp/
tar -xzf /tmp/rabbitmq-data-latest.tar.gz -C /

# Step 5: Start the first node
systemctl start rabbitmq-server

# Step 6: Import definitions
rabbitmqctl import_definitions /tmp/definitions-latest.json

# Step 7: Join other nodes to the cluster
# On node 2:
rabbitmqctl stop_app
rabbitmqctl join_cluster rabbit@node1
rabbitmqctl start_app

# On node 3:
rabbitmqctl stop_app
rabbitmqctl join_cluster rabbit@node1
rabbitmqctl start_app

# Step 8: Verify recovery
rabbitmqctl list_queues
rabbitmqctl cluster_status
```

4. **Post-Recovery**:
   - Update DNS or load balancers to point to new cluster
   - Verify client applications reconnect properly
   - Monitor for any issues
