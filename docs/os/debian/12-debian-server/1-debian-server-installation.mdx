# Debian Server Installation

## Introduction

Debian is one of the most stable and secure Linux distributions available, making it an excellent choice for server deployments. This guide walks you through the process of installing Debian Server on your hardware or virtual machine. We'll cover everything from downloading the installation media to completing the initial system configuration, ensuring you have a solid foundation for building and managing your server.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have:

- A computer or virtual machine with at least:
  - 1 GHz CPU
  - 1 GB RAM (2 GB recommended)
  - 10 GB free disk space
- Access to the internet for downloading the installation media
- A USB drive (2 GB or larger) if installing on physical hardware
- Basic knowledge of computer hardware and networking concepts

## Step 1: Download Debian Server Installation Media

The first step is to download the Debian installation image from the official website.

1. Visit the [Debian downloads page](https://www.debian.org/download)
2. Choose the stable version of Debian (currently Debian 12 "Bookworm")
3. Select the "netinst" (network installer) image for your architecture (most commonly amd64 for 64-bit systems)

The netinst image is a minimal installation image that downloads necessary packages from the internet during installation, ensuring you get the most up-to-date packages.

## Step 2: Create Installation Media

### For Physical Hardware

If you're installing on physical hardware, you'll need to create a bootable USB drive:

```bash
# On Linux, use the dd command (replace /dev/sdX with your USB drive)
sudo dd if=debian-12.0.0-amd64-netinst.iso of=/dev/sdX bs=4M status=progress

# On Windows, use tools like Rufus or Balena Etcher
```

### For Virtual Machines

If you're using a virtual machine:

1. Create a new virtual machine in your hypervisor (VirtualBox, VMware, etc.)
2. Configure it with the recommended system resources
3. Attach the downloaded ISO file to the virtual machine's optical drive

## Step 3: Boot from Installation Media

1. Insert your USB drive into the computer or start your virtual machine
2. Boot from the installation media (you may need to modify boot order in BIOS/UEFI)
3. At the Debian installer boot menu, select "Install" (not "Graphical install" for the server version)

## Step 4: Basic Configuration

Follow the on-screen prompts to configure basic settings:

1. **Select Language, Location, and Keyboard Layout**
   - Choose based on your preferences and region

2. **Configure Network**
   - Set up a hostname for your server (e.g., `debian-server`)
   - Configure a domain name if needed (e.g., `local` for home use)

3. **Set Up Users and Passwords**
   - Create a root password (make it strong!)
   - Create a regular user account
   - Set a password for the user account

## Step 5: Disk Partitioning

The installer will guide you through partitioning your disk:

1. Select "Guided - use entire disk" for a simple setup
2. Choose the target disk for installation
3. Select a partitioning scheme:
   - "All files in one partition" is simplest for beginners
   - "Separate /home partition" provides better separation of system and user data
   - "Separate /home, /var, and /tmp partitions" offers maximum flexibility

4. Review the proposed changes and confirm to write changes to disk

For a basic server, a partition layout might look like:

```
/        - 8GB (root filesystem)
/home    - 10GB (user data)
swap     - 2GB (virtual memory)
```

## Step 6: Package Selection

The installer will ask which software to install:

1. When prompted for a mirror, select a server close to your location
2. Configure the package manager proxy if needed (usually blank is fine)
3. Choose whether to participate in the package usage survey (optional)
4. At the software selection screen, typically select:
   - SSH server
   - Standard system utilities
   
Deselect the Desktop environment for a minimal server installation.

Here's what the software selection screen might look like:

```
[ ] Debian desktop environment
[ ] GNOME
[ ] Xfce
[ ] KDE Plasma
[ ] Cinnamon
[ ] MATE
[ ] LXDE
[ ] LXQt
[*] SSH server
[*] Standard system utilities
[ ] Print server
[ ] Web server
[ ] Database server
```

## Step 7: Install GRUB Boot Loader

1. When prompted, install GRUB boot loader to the master boot record (MBR)
2. Select the disk where GRUB should be installed (usually the same disk as the system)

## Step 8: Complete Installation

1. The system will finalize the installation and prompt you to remove the installation media
2. Reboot the system

Congratulations! You now have a basic Debian server installed.

## Step 9: First Boot and Initial Configuration

After rebooting, log in with the user account you created during installation.

### Update Your System

It's good practice to update your system immediately after installation:

```bash
# Switch to root user
su -

# Update package lists
apt update

# Upgrade all packages
apt upgrade

# Alternatively, use sudo if configured
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
```

### Configure SSH for Remote Access

If you plan to manage your server remotely, ensure SSH is properly configured:

```bash
# Check SSH service status
systemctl status ssh

# If needed, start and enable SSH at boot
systemctl start ssh
systemctl enable ssh
```

To enhance security, consider editing the SSH configuration:

```bash
# Edit SSH config file
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config

# Make these security changes:
# - Change default port
# - Disable root login
# - Use public key authentication
# - Limit user access

# Restart SSH after changes
sudo systemctl restart ssh
```

### Configure Firewall

Set up a basic firewall using UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall):

```bash
# Install UFW if not already installed
sudo apt install ufw

# Allow SSH connections (adjust port if you changed it)
sudo ufw allow 22/tcp

# Enable the firewall
sudo ufw enable

# Check status
sudo ufw status
```

## Common Issues and Troubleshooting

### Network Configuration Problems

If you encounter network issues:

```bash
# Check network interface status
ip a

# Test connectivity
ping -c 4 1.1.1.1

# Check DNS resolution
nslookup debian.org

# Restart networking
sudo systemctl restart networking
```

### Boot Problems

If your system fails to boot:

1. Boot from installation media and select "Rescue mode"
2. Follow prompts to mount your system
3. Check and repair GRUB if needed:

```bash
# Update GRUB
update-grub

# Reinstall GRUB if necessary
grub-install /dev/sda
```

## Server Administration Basics

Here are some basic commands to help you manage your Debian server:

```bash
# Check system information
uname -a
lsb_release -a

# Monitor system resources
top
htop  # may need to install: sudo apt install htop

# View disk usage
df -h
du -sh /var/log

# View system logs
less /var/log/syslog

# Manage services
sudo systemctl status service-name
sudo systemctl start service-name
sudo systemctl enable service-name
```

## Security Best Practices

To keep your Debian server secure:

1. **Keep the system updated**
   ```bash
   sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
   ```

2. **Install security updates automatically**
   ```bash
   sudo apt install unattended-upgrades
   sudo dpkg-reconfigure unattended-upgrades
   ```

3. **Use strong passwords and consider public key authentication for SSH**

4. **Limit user privileges** - use sudo instead of root

5. **Install and configure fail2ban to protect against brute force attacks**
   ```bash
   sudo apt install fail2ban
   sudo cp /etc/fail2ban/jail.conf /etc/fail2ban/jail.local
   sudo nano /etc/fail2ban/jail.local
   sudo systemctl restart fail2ban
   ```

## Next Steps

After setting up your Debian server, you might want to:

1. Install and configure web services (Apache, Nginx)
2. Set up databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL)
3. Configure email services (Postfix, Dovecot)
4. Set up monitoring tools (Prometheus, Grafana)
5. Implement regular backup solutions
