# Debian Accessibility Options

## Introduction

Accessibility (often abbreviated as a11y) refers to the design of products, devices, services, or environments for people with disabilities. In the context of Debian Linux, accessibility options ensure that users with visual, hearing, physical, or cognitive impairments can effectively use the operating system.

Debian has a strong commitment to accessibility, offering a range of tools and configurations that make computing accessible to everyone. This guide will explore the various accessibility features available in Debian, how to install them, and how to configure them for optimal use.

## Debian Accessibility Team

Debian has a dedicated [Accessibility Team](https://www.debian.org/devel/debian-accessibility/) that works to improve the usability of Debian for users with various disabilities. Their mission is to develop Debian into an operating system that is especially well suited for the requirements of people with disabilities.

## Installing Accessibility Tools

Debian provides various accessibility packages that can be installed either during the initial installation or later.

### During Installation

When booting the Debian installer, you can enable accessibility features by:

1. At the boot menu, press `Tab` to edit the boot commands
2. Add the `speakup` parameter to enable speech synthesis during installation
3. Alternatively, you can use the `a11y` boot parameter to access more options

```bash
# Example boot command with speech synthesis
install speakup.synth=soft
```

### Post-Installation

After installing Debian, you can add accessibility tools using the package manager:

```bash
# Install basic accessibility packages
sudo apt update
sudo apt install gnome-accessibility-themes at-spi2-core

# Install screen reader
sudo apt install orca

# Install on-screen keyboard
sudo apt install onboard

# Install braille support
sudo apt install brltty
```

## Screen Readers

Screen readers are essential tools for users with visual impairments, converting on-screen information to speech or braille output.

### Orca Screen Reader

Orca is the most popular screen reader for Linux environments, including Debian.

#### Installation

```bash
sudo apt install orca speech-dispatcher
```

#### Basic Configuration

After installation, you can start Orca with:

```bash
orca
```

You can also set it to start automatically when you log in by adding it to your startup applications.

#### Keyboard Shortcuts

| Shortcut | Function |
|----------|----------|
| `Insert + Space` | Orca Modifier Menu |
| `Orca + t` | Read current window title |
| `Orca + r` | Read current document |
| `Orca + h` | Read current line |

### Speakup

Speakup is a screen reader for the Linux console, useful for server environments or when X is not running.

```bash
sudo apt install speakup speakup-tools espeakup
```

## Braille Support

For users who are blind or have severe visual impairments, Debian offers excellent braille support through BRLTTY.

### Installing BRLTTY

```bash
sudo apt install brltty
```

### Configuring BRLTTY

The main configuration file is located at `/etc/brltty.conf`. You'll need to specify your braille display model:

```bash
# Example configuration for a Freedom Scientific Focus display
braille-device serial:/dev/ttyUSB0
braille-driver fs
```

### Testing Braille Output

After configuring BRLTTY, you can test the braille output with:

```bash
echo "Hello World" | brltty -bfs
```

## Keyboard Accessibility

Many users with physical disabilities rely on keyboard adaptations to use their computers effectively.

### Sticky Keys

Sticky Keys allow users to press key combinations one key at a time instead of simultaneously.

Enable Sticky Keys in GNOME:

1. Go to Settings → Universal Access → Typing
2. Enable "Sticky Keys"

From the command line:

```bash
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.a11y.keyboard stickykeys-enable true
```

### Slow Keys

Slow Keys add a delay between when a key is pressed and when it's accepted, helping users with hand tremors.

Enable Slow Keys in GNOME:

1. Go to Settings → Universal Access → Typing
2. Enable "Slow Keys" and adjust the delay

From the command line:

```bash
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.a11y.keyboard slowkeys-enable true
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.a11y.keyboard slowkeys-delay 300
```

### On-Screen Keyboard

For users who cannot use a physical keyboard, Debian provides on-screen keyboard options.

```bash
# Install Onboard, a flexible on-screen keyboard
sudo apt install onboard
```

Start Onboard from the application menu or with:

```bash
onboard
```

## Visual Accessibility

### High Contrast Themes

High contrast themes make content more visible for users with visual impairments.

Install and activate high contrast themes:

```bash
sudo apt install gnome-accessibility-themes
```

Enable high contrast in GNOME:
1. Go to Settings → Universal Access → Seeing
2. Enable "High Contrast"

### Magnification

Debian offers several screen magnification tools for users with partial vision.

#### GNOME Magnifier

Built into GNOME:

1. Go to Settings → Universal Access → Seeing
2. Enable "Zoom" and adjust the magnification level

Keyboard shortcut to toggle zoom: `Alt + Super + 8`

#### Compiz Magnifier

For users of the Compiz window manager:

```bash
sudo apt install compiz compizconfig-settings-manager
```

Configure magnification:
1. Run `ccsm`
2. Enable the "Enhanced Zoom" plugin

## Hearing Accessibility

### Visual Alerts

For users with hearing impairments, Debian can display visual cues instead of audible alerts.

Enable visual bell in GNOME:

1. Go to Settings → Universal Access → Hearing
2. Enable "Visual Alerts"

From the command line:

```bash
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.a11y.applications visual-bell true
```

### Closed Captions

Many video players in Debian support closed captions and subtitles:

```bash
# Install VLC with subtitle support
sudo apt install vlc
```

## Speech Recognition

Speech recognition in Linux has improved significantly, though it still lags behind commercial offerings.

### Simon Speech Recognition

```bash
sudo apt install simon
```

Basic setup:

1. Run Simon
2. Create a new model or import an existing one
3. Train the recognition model with your voice

### Alternatives

For more advanced speech recognition, you might consider using:

- Mozilla DeepSpeech with custom scripts
- Kaldi speech recognition framework

## Creating Accessible Documents

When creating documents on Debian, ensure they are accessible:

### LibreOffice Accessibility

LibreOffice has built-in accessibility features:

```bash
# Install LibreOffice
sudo apt install libreoffice
```

To create accessible documents:
1. Use proper heading structures
2. Add alt text to images
3. Use the Accessibility Checker (Format → Accessibility)

## Desktop Environment Specific Settings

Different desktop environments in Debian have varying accessibility features.

### GNOME

GNOME has the most comprehensive accessibility support:

```bash
# Install GNOME accessibility features
sudo apt install gnome-accessibility-themes gnome-orca
```

Access settings: Settings → Universal Access

### KDE

KDE also offers strong accessibility features:

```bash
# Install KDE accessibility features
sudo apt install kdeaccessibility
```

Access settings: System Settings → Accessibility

### XFCE

For XFCE users:

```bash
# Install XFCE accessibility tools
sudo apt install xfce4-goodies onboard
```

## Creating an Accessible Debian System from Scratch

For a fully accessible Debian installation from the beginning, consider using the Debian Installer with speech synthesis support.

Here's a comprehensive workflow:

1. Download the Debian netinst ISO
2. Boot with speech synthesis: add `speakup.synth=soft` to the boot parameters
3. Follow the installation process using speech feedback
4. Choose the "Desktop" and "Accessibility" task during installation
5. After installation, configure additional tools as needed

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Screen Reader Not Speaking

If Orca is installed but not speaking:

```bash
# Check if speech-dispatcher is running
ps aux | grep speech-dispatcher

# Restart speech-dispatcher if needed
sudo systemctl restart speech-dispatcher

# Test speech output
spd-say "Testing speech output"
```

### Braille Display Not Detected

If your braille display isn't working:

```bash
# Check if device is detected
lsusb

# Check BRLTTY status
sudo systemctl status brltty

# Restart BRLTTY with debugging
sudo systemctl stop brltty
sudo brltty -v -e
```

## Building Accessible Applications on Debian

If you're a developer working on Debian, consider these accessibility guidelines:

### Testing with Screen Readers

Regularly test your applications with Orca:

```bash
orca -d 100 -e debug -l debug
```

### Using Accessible Toolkits

GTK and Qt have accessibility APIs. Ensure you're using them correctly:

```bash
# Check if your GTK application is accessible
accerciser
```

## Summary

Debian provides robust accessibility options that make computing accessible to users with a wide range of disabilities. From screen readers and braille support to keyboard adaptations and visual enhancements, Debian's commitment to accessibility ensures that everyone can use the operating system effectively.

By understanding and implementing these accessibility tools, you can create a more inclusive computing environment for yourself or others. Remember that accessibility benefits everyone, not just users with disabilities.
