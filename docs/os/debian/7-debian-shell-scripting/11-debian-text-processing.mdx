# Debian Text Processing

## Introduction

Text processing is a fundamental skill for anyone working with Debian or any Linux distribution. In the Unix philosophy, text is the universal interface - configuration files, logs, data, and even system information are stored as plain text. This makes text processing tools incredibly powerful for system administration, data analysis, and automation tasks.

In this guide, we'll explore the essential text processing tools available in Debian systems, with practical examples and techniques that you can immediately apply to your shell scripts and daily tasks. We'll focus on the most useful commands for manipulating, filtering, transforming, and analyzing text data.

## Basic Text Processing Commands

Before diving into more advanced tools, let's explore some fundamental commands that form the backbone of text processing in Debian.

### cat - Concatenate and Display Files

The `cat` command is one of the simplest yet most useful commands for working with text files.

```bash
# Display the contents of a file
cat /etc/hostname

# Combine multiple files
cat file1.txt file2.txt > combined.txt

# Display with line numbers
cat -n /etc/passwd
```

### head and tail - Viewing Portions of Files

The `head` and `tail` commands allow you to view the beginning or end of files:

```bash
# Display first 10 lines of a file
head /var/log/syslog

# Display last 10 lines of a file
tail /var/log/syslog

# Display first 5 lines
head -n 5 /etc/passwd

# Follow a log file as it grows
tail -f /var/log/syslog
```

**Example: Monitoring the most recent log entries**

```bash
# Input: Run this command in terminal
tail -f /var/log/syslog

# Output: (constantly updates as new logs are added)
Mar 13 15:42:22 debian systemd[1]: Starting Daily apt download activities...
Mar 13 15:42:22 debian systemd[1]: apt-daily.service: Succeeded.
Mar 13 15:42:22 debian systemd[1]: Finished Daily apt download activities.
```

### sort - Sorting Text

The `sort` command arranges lines of text alphabetically or numerically:

```bash
# Sort a file alphabetically
sort names.txt

# Sort numerically
sort -n numbers.txt

# Sort in reverse order
sort -r names.txt

# Sort by specific field (column)
sort -k2 data.txt
```

**Example: Sorting process by memory usage**

```bash
# Input
ps aux | sort -k4 -r | head

# Output
user       1234  4.0 15.2 3245676 622588 ?      Sl   10:14   3:42 firefox
user       2468  0.5  8.3 2867544 338544 ?      Sl   11:22   0:32 chromium
root       1111  0.2  3.7  874320 150984 ?      Ss   09:15   0:18 Xorg
```

### uniq - Finding Unique Lines

The `uniq` command reports or filters out repeated lines in a file:

```bash
# Remove duplicate consecutive lines
uniq list.txt

# Count occurrences of lines
uniq -c list.txt

# Show only duplicate lines
uniq -d list.txt
```

**Example: Counting word frequencies in a text file**

```bash
# Input
cat essay.txt | tr ' ' '
' | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head

# Output
 143 the
  97 and
  86 to
  70 of
  68 in
  53 a
  47 is
  40 that
  32 for
  28 it
```

### wc - Counting Words, Lines, and Characters

The `wc` (word count) command gives you statistics about text:

```bash
# Count lines, words, and characters
wc file.txt

# Count only lines
wc -l file.txt

# Count only words
wc -w file.txt

# Count only characters
wc -c file.txt
```

**Example: Checking lines of code in a project**

```bash
# Input
find . -name "*.py" | xargs wc -l

# Output
   25 ./utils.py
  142 ./main.py
   86 ./config.py
  253 total
```

## Powerful Text Processing Tools

Now let's explore more advanced text processing tools that are essential for shell scripting.

### grep - Pattern Searching

The `grep` command searches for patterns in text and is one of the most versatile tools for text processing:

```bash
# Search for a pattern in a file
grep "error" /var/log/syslog

# Search recursively in directories
grep -r "function" /path/to/project

# Show line numbers
grep -n "TODO" *.py

# Count matching lines
grep -c "failed" /var/log/auth.log

# Case-insensitive search
grep -i "warning" /var/log/syslog
```

**Example: Finding all configuration files containing a specific setting**

```bash
# Input
grep -r "max_connections" /etc/

# Output
/etc/mysql/my.cnf:max_connections = 100
/etc/postgresql/13/main/postgresql.conf:# max_connections = 100
/etc/redis/redis.conf:# max_connections 10000
```

### sed - Stream Editor

The `sed` command is a powerful stream editor for filtering and transforming text:

```bash
# Replace text
sed 's/old/new/' file.txt

# Replace all occurrences on each line
sed 's/old/new/g' file.txt

# Delete lines matching a pattern
sed '/pattern/d' file.txt

# Replace text on specific lines
sed '1,5 s/old/new/g' file.txt
```

**Example: Updating configuration values**

```bash
# Input (content of my.conf)
# port = 3306
# max_connections = 100
# socket = /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock

# Command to change the max connections
sed -i 's/max_connections = 100/max_connections = 200/' my.conf

# Output (updated file)
# port = 3306
# max_connections = 200
# socket = /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock
```

### awk - Text Processing Language

`awk` is a complete text processing language, especially powerful for column-based text manipulation:

```bash
# Print specific fields (columns)
awk '{print $1, $3}' file.txt

# Filter rows based on conditions
awk '$3 > 100 {print $1, $3}' data.txt

# Sum values in a column
awk '{sum += $2} END {print sum}' numbers.txt

# Process with custom field separator
awk -F: '{print $1, $3}' /etc/passwd
```

**Example: Analyzing disk usage by directory**

```bash
# Input
du -h /var | sort -hr | head -n 5

# Enhancing the output with awk
du -h /var | sort -hr | head -n 5 | awk '{printf "%-15s %s
", $2, $1}'

# Output
/var/lib        1.2G
/var/cache      856M
/var/log        340M
/var/tmp        124M
/var/spool      45M
```

## Combining Tools: The Power of Pipelines

One of the most powerful features of Debian text processing is the ability to combine tools using pipelines (`|`). This allows you to create complex text processing workflows.

### Example 1: Finding the 5 largest files in a directory

```bash
find /var/log -type f -exec ls -sh {} \; | sort -hr | head -n 5

# Output
256M /var/log/journal/af3d8e11ef904a35b9aefd52e342e645/system.journal
124M /var/log/journal/af3d8e11ef904a35b9aefd52e342e645/user-1000.journal
56M  /var/log/auth.log.1
32M  /var/log/syslog.1
24M  /var/log/kern.log.1
```

### Example 2: Parsing and analyzing Apache access logs

```bash
# Find the most frequent visitors (IP addresses)
cat /var/log/apache2/access.log | awk '{print $1}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head -n 5

# Output
  423 192.168.1.105
  346 192.168.1.42
  211 8.8.8.8
  198 192.168.1.10
  156 192.168.1.254
```

### Example 3: Creating a summary of system users

```bash
awk -F: '{print $1 ":" $3 ":" $7}' /etc/passwd | sort -t: -k2 -n

# Output
root:0:/bin/bash
daemon:1:/usr/sbin/nologin
bin:2:/usr/sbin/nologin
sys:3:/usr/sbin/nologin
user:1000:/bin/bash
```

## Regular Expressions for Pattern Matching

Regular expressions (regex) are patterns that describe sets of strings. They are extremely powerful for text processing.

### Basic Regex Patterns

- `.` - Matches any single character
- `^` - Matches start of line
- `$` - Matches end of line
- `[abc]` - Matches any of the characters a, b, or c
- `[^abc]` - Matches any character except a, b, or c
- `a*` - Matches zero or more occurrences of a
- `a+` - Matches one or more occurrences of a
- `a?` - Matches zero or one occurrence of a

### Example: Extracting email addresses from a text file

```bash
grep -E '[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\.[A-Za-z]{2,4}' contacts.txt

# Output
john.doe@example.com
jane.smith@company.org
contact@debian.org
```

### Example: Validating IP addresses in a log file

```bash
grep -E '^([0-9]{1,3}\.){3}[0-9]{1,3}' server.log

# Output
192.168.1.1 - - [13/Mar/2025:10:00:01 +0000] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 2326
10.0.0.5 - - [13/Mar/2025:10:00:15 +0000] "POST /login HTTP/1.1" 302 0
172.16.254.1 - - [13/Mar/2025:10:01:30 +0000] "GET /images/logo.png HTTP/1.1" 200 4526
```

## Practical Applications

Let's look at some real-world applications of text processing in Debian systems.

### System Monitoring and Log Analysis

```bash
# Find all failed login attempts
grep "Failed password" /var/log/auth.log | awk '{print $9}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr

# Monitor system load
sar 1 5 | awk '/Average/ {print "Average Load: " $3 " " $4 " " $5}'
```

### Configuration Management

```bash
# Find and backup all configuration files that have been modified in the last day
find /etc -type f -mtime -1 -name "*.conf" -exec cp {} {}.bak \;

# Standardize configuration files by replacing tabs with spaces
find /etc -name "*.conf" -type f -exec sed -i 's/\t/    /g' {} \;
```

### Data Extraction and Transformation

```bash
# Extract specific fields from CSV and format as JSON
awk -F, '{print "{\"name\": \"" $1 "\", \"email\": \"" $2 "\", \"phone\": \"" $3 "\"}"}' contacts.csv

# Convert data between formats
cat data.csv | tr ',' '|' > data.psv
```

## Creating a Text Processing Workflow

Let's walk through a complete text processing workflow for analyzing web server logs.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# web_log_analyzer.sh - Analyze web server logs for traffic patterns

LOG_FILE="/var/log/apache2/access.log"

echo "=== Web Server Traffic Analysis ==="
echo

# 1. Count total requests
echo "Total requests:"
wc -l "$LOG_FILE" | awk '{print $1}'
echo

# 2. Find top 10 visitors (IP addresses)
echo "Top 10 visitors by IP:"
awk '{print $1}' "$LOG_FILE" | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head -10
echo

# 3. Show HTTP status code distribution
echo "HTTP status code distribution:"
awk '{print $9}' "$LOG_FILE" | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr
echo

# 4. Find the most requested pages
echo "Top 10 requested pages:"
awk '{print $7}' "$LOG_FILE" | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head -10
echo

# 5. Show hourly traffic distribution
echo "Hourly traffic distribution:"
awk '{split($4,a,"["); split(a[2],b,":"); print b[1] ":" b[2]}' "$LOG_FILE" | sort | uniq -c | sort -k2
```

## Text Processing Performance Tips

When working with large files, performance becomes important:

1. **Use stream processing:** Tools like `grep`, `sed`, and `awk` process files line by line without loading the entire file into memory.

2. **Pre-filter your data:** Use `grep` to filter relevant lines before applying more complex processing with `awk` or `sed`.

3. **Consider specialized tools:** For very large files, consider tools like `parallel` to process data in parallel.

4. **Use efficient patterns:** Make your regex patterns as specific as possible to avoid unnecessary processing.

```bash
# Instead of this (slow for large files)
cat huge_file.log | grep "error" | awk '{print $1, $2}'

# Use this (more efficient)
grep "error" huge_file.log | awk '{print $1, $2}'
```

## Summary

Text processing is an essential skill for working with Debian systems. The tools we've covered—`cat`, `head`, `tail`, `grep`, `sed`, `awk`, and others—provide powerful capabilities for manipulating, analyzing, and transforming text data.

By combining these tools using pipelines, you can create efficient workflows for system administration, data analysis, and automation tasks. Regular expressions extend these capabilities further by enabling complex pattern matching.

Remember that the Unix philosophy encourages combining simple tools to solve complex problems. With the text processing tools available in Debian, you can handle virtually any text-based task efficiently.
