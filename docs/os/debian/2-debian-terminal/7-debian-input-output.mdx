# Debian Input/Output

## Introduction

In Linux systems like Debian, the ability to control how data flows between programs, files, and the terminal is a powerful feature. This concept, known as Input/Output (I/O), is foundational to effective terminal usage and scripting. In this tutorial, we'll explore how Debian handles I/O operations, including standard streams, redirection, pipes, and practical file operations.

## Understanding Standard Streams

Every command executed in a Debian terminal automatically connects to three standard data streams:

1. **Standard Input (stdin)** - Channel for data input (by default, your keyboard)
2. **Standard Output (stdout)** - Channel for normal command output
3. **Standard Error (stderr)** - Channel for error messages

```mermaid

    A[Keyboard] -->|stdin| B[Command]
    B -->|stdout| C[Terminal Screen]
    B -->|stderr| C
```

Each of these streams has a file descriptor number:
- stdin: 0
- stdout: 1
- stderr: 2

Understanding these streams allows you to control how data flows in and out of commands.

## Basic Output Display

Let's start with some basic commands that demonstrate output:

```bash
# Simple text output
echo "Hello, Debian!"

# Displaying file contents
cat /etc/debian_version
```

When you run these commands, the output appears in your terminal because stdout is connected to your terminal display by default.

## Redirection Basics

Redirection allows you to control where input comes from and where output goes. The symbols `>`, `>>`, `<`, and others are used for redirection.

### Output Redirection

To redirect stdout to a file instead of the terminal:

```bash
# Redirect output to a file (overwrites if file exists)
echo "This text goes to a file" > output.txt

# Append output to the end of an existing file
echo "Adding more text" >> output.txt
```

Let's see what happens:

```bash
# Create a file with output redirection
ls -la > file_listing.txt

# View the file contents
cat file_listing.txt
```

### Input Redirection

You can also use files as input instead of typing:

```bash
# Use a file as input for a command
sort < unsorted_numbers.txt

# First create a sample file
echo -e "5
3
1
4
2" > unsorted_numbers.txt

# Then sort it using input redirection
sort < unsorted_numbers.txt
```

### Redirecting Error Messages

Error messages (stderr) can be redirected separately:

```bash
# Redirect only errors to a file
ls /nonexistent 2> errors.txt

# Redirect standard output and errors to different files
find /etc -name "*.conf" > configs.txt 2> find_errors.txt
```

### Redirecting Both Output and Errors

To redirect both stdout and stderr to the same file:

```bash
# Method 1: Redirect all output to a single file
ls -la /etc /nonexistent > all_output.txt 2>&1

# Method 2: Using newer syntax (Bash 4+)
ls -la /etc /nonexistent &> all_output.txt
```

## Discarding Output

Sometimes you want to ignore output completely. For this, you can redirect to `/dev/null`, which is a special device that discards everything written to it:

```bash
# Discard standard output
ls -la > /dev/null

# Discard error messages
ls /nonexistent 2> /dev/null

# Discard all output
ls -la /etc /nonexistent &> /dev/null
```

## Using Pipes

Pipes (`|`) allow you to use the output of one command as the input for another command:

```bash
# Count the number of files in /etc
ls /etc | wc -l

# Find the 5 largest files in your home directory
du -h ~/. | sort -rh | head -5

# Find all Debian configuration files containing the word "network"
grep -l "network" /etc/*.conf | sort
```

Pipes create powerful command combinations. Here's a more complex example:

```bash
# Find the 10 most common words in a text file
cat /etc/passwd | tr -cs '[:alpha:]' '
' | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head -10
```

This pipeline:
1. Outputs a file
2. Converts non-letters to newlines
3. Converts everything to lowercase
4. Sorts all words
5. Counts unique occurrences
6. Sorts by frequency (highest first)
7. Shows only the top 10 results

## Here Documents and Here Strings

"Here documents" allow you to input multiple lines of text directly into a command:

```bash
# Create a multi-line file using a here document
cat > my_script.sh << 'EOF'
#!/bin/bash
echo "This is a sample script"
echo "Created using a here document"
echo "on $(date)"
EOF

# Make it executable
chmod +x my_script.sh

# Run it
./my_script.sh
```

Here strings provide a simpler way to pass string data to commands:

```bash
# Count the words in a string
wc -w <<< "How many words are in this string?"

# Convert a string to uppercase
tr '[:lower:]' '[:upper:]' <<< "convert this to uppercase"
```

## Process Substitution

Process substitution lets you use the output of a command where a file name is expected:

```bash
# Compare the output of two commands
diff <(ls /bin) <(ls /usr/bin)

# Use multiple command outputs as input
grep "important" <(cat file1.txt) <(cat file2.txt)
```

## Practical Examples

Let's explore some practical examples of I/O operations in Debian:

### Example 1: Log File Analysis

```bash
# Count error occurrences in a log file
grep "ERROR" /var/log/syslog | wc -l

# Extract unique error messages and sort by frequency
grep "ERROR" /var/log/syslog | cut -d: -f4- | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr
```

### Example 2: Creating a Simple Backup Script

```bash
# Create a backup script
cat > backup.sh << 'EOF'
#!/bin/bash
# Simple backup script

# Define source and target
SOURCE_DIR=$HOME/Documents
BACKUP_DIR=$HOME/Backups
BACKUP_FILE=backup_$(date +%Y%m%d).tar.gz

# Create backup directory if it doesn't exist
mkdir -p $BACKUP_DIR

# Create the backup
tar -czf $BACKUP_DIR/$BACKUP_FILE $SOURCE_DIR 2> backup_errors.log

# Report results
echo "Backup completed. File saved as $BACKUP_DIR/$BACKUP_FILE"
echo "File size: $(du -h $BACKUP_DIR/$BACKUP_FILE | cut -f1)"
EOF

# Make it executable
chmod +x backup.sh
```

### Example 3: Processing Data Files

Let's say you have a CSV file with user data and want to extract specific information:

```bash
# Create a sample CSV file
cat > users.csv << 'EOF'
id,name,email,department
1,John Doe,john@example.com,Engineering
2,Jane Smith,jane@example.com,Marketing
3,Bob Johnson,bob@example.com,Engineering
4,Alice Williams,alice@example.com,HR
5,Charlie Brown,charlie@example.com,Engineering
EOF

# Count users by department
cut -d, -f4 users.csv | sort | uniq -c

# Extract all email addresses for the Engineering department
grep "Engineering" users.csv | cut -d, -f3
```

## Tee Command: Splitting Output

The `tee` command allows you to redirect output to a file while still displaying it on the screen:

```bash
# Display directory contents and save to file simultaneously
ls -la | tee file_listing.txt

# Append to existing file with tee
echo "Additional content" | tee -a file_listing.txt
```

This is especially useful for logging command output while still monitoring it in real-time.

## Advanced I/O Control with exec

The `exec` command allows you to permanently redirect I/O for an entire script:

```bash
# Create a script with exec redirection
cat > exec_example.sh << 'EOF'
#!/bin/bash

# Redirect all output to a log file
exec > script_log.txt 2>&1

echo "This goes to the log file"
ls -la /etc
echo "Script completed at $(date)"
EOF

# Make it executable
chmod +x exec_example.sh
```

## Exercises

To reinforce your learning, try these exercises:

1. Create a script that finds all files modified in the last 24 hours and saves the list to a file while also displaying it on screen.
2. Write a command pipeline that extracts all unique IP addresses from a log file.
3. Create a backup script that archives your home directory while redirecting error messages to a log file and normal output to another file.
4. Use process substitution to compare the list of installed packages on two different Debian systems.
5. Write a script that uses a here document to create an HTML file with dynamic content.
