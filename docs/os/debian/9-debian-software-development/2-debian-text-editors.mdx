## Setting Up Your Text Editor for Development

Regardless of which editor you choose, proper configuration can significantly improve your productivity. Here are some general tips:

### 1. Syntax Highlighting

All modern text editors support syntax highlighting, which colorizes different parts of your code (keywords, strings, comments, etc.) to improve readability.

**Example (Vim):**
```vim
" Enable syntax highlighting
syntax on
```

### 2. Line Numbers

Line numbers are crucial for debugging and navigating code.

**Example (VS Code settings.json):**
```json
{
    "editor.lineNumbers": "on"
}
```

### 3. Indentation Settings

Consistent indentation improves code readability. Most editors let you configure tab size and whether to use spaces or tabs.

**Example (Gedit):**
Edit → Preferences → Editor → Tab width: 4, Insert spaces instead of tabs

### 4. File Type Detection

Ensure your editor can detect file types correctly to apply the appropriate syntax highlighting and indentation rules.

### 5. Useful Plugins

Consider installing plugins that enhance your productivity:

- Linters and formatters for code quality
- Git integration
- Language-specific plugins
- Snippet libraries

**Example: Installing Python linting in VS Code**
```bash
pip install pylint
```

Then add to VS Code settings.json:
```json
{
    "python.linting.pylintEnabled": true,
    "python.linting.enabled": true
}
```

## Real-World Applications

### 1. Web Development Workflow

For web development, you might set up your editor to handle HTML, CSS, and JavaScript efficiently.

**Example (VS Code):**

1. Install extensions:
   - HTML CSS Support
   - JavaScript (ES6) code snippets
   - Live Server

2. Create a simple web project:

HTML file (index.html):
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>My Debian Project</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css" />
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello from Debian!</h1>
    <p>This is a simple web page created with a Debian text editor.</p>
    <button id="clickMe">Click Me</button>
    
    <script src="script.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

CSS file (styles.css):
```css
body {
    font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
    max-width: 800px;
    margin: 0 auto;
    padding: 20px;
}

h1 {
    color: #d70a53;  /* Debian red */
}

button {
    background-color: #d70a53;
    color: white;
    border: none;
    padding: 10px 15px;
    cursor: pointer;
}
```

JavaScript file (script.js):
```javascript
document.getElementById('clickMe').addEventListener('click', function() {
    alert('Hello from Debian JavaScript!');
});
```

### 2. Python Development Environment

Setting up your editor for Python development.

**Example (Vim):**

1. Install plugins using a plugin manager like Vundle:
   - Add to ~/.vimrc:
   ```vim
   " Set up Vundle
   set nocompatible
   filetype off
   set rtp+=~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim
   call vundle#begin()
   
   Plugin 'VundleVim/Vundle.vim'
   Plugin 'vim-syntastic/syntastic'  " Syntax checking
   Plugin 'davidhalter/jedi-vim'     " Python autocompletion
   Plugin 'preservim/nerdtree'       " File explorer
   
   call vundle#end()
   filetype plugin indent on
   
   " Python-specific settings
   autocmd FileType python set tabstop=4
   autocmd FileType python set softtabstop=4
   autocmd FileType python set shiftwidth=4
   autocmd FileType python set expandtab
   autocmd FileType python set autoindent
   autocmd FileType python set fileformat=unix
   ```

2. Create a Python script:
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

class DebianCalculator:
    def __init__(self):
        self.result = 0
        
    def add(self, x):
        self.result += x
        return self
        
    def subtract(self, x):
        self.result -= x
        return self
        
    def value(self):
        return self.result

# Test the calculator
calc = DebianCalculator()
result = calc.add(10).subtract(5).add(2).value()
print(f"The result is: {result}")  # Should output: The result is: 7
```

### 3. Shell Script Development

Creating shell scripts for automating tasks in Debian.

**Example (Nano):**

```bash
nano sys_info.sh
```

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# System Information Script

echo "======= System Information ======="
echo "Hostname: $(hostname)"
echo "Distribution: $(lsb_release -ds 2>/dev/null || cat /etc/*release | grep -i name | head -1 || echo 'Unknown')"
echo "Kernel: $(uname -r)"
echo "Uptime: $(uptime -p)"
echo "CPU: $(grep 'model name' /proc/cpuinfo | head -1 | cut -d':' -f2 | sed 's/^[ \t]*//')"
echo "RAM: $(free -h | awk '/^Mem:/ {print $2}')"
echo "Disk Usage: $(df -h --output=pcent / | tail -1)"
echo "=================================="
```

Save the file, make it executable, and run it:
```bash
chmod +x sys_info.sh
./sys_info.sh
```
