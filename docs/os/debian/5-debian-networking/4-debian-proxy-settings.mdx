# Debian Proxy Settings

In many network environments, especially corporate or educational settings, direct internet access might be restricted. Instead, traffic must pass through a proxy server that acts as an intermediary between your Debian system and the wider internet. This guide will help you understand and configure proxy settings correctly in Debian.

## What is a Proxy Server?

A proxy server functions as an intermediary between your computer and the internet. When you configure proxy settings in Debian, you're essentially telling your system to route specific types of network traffic through this intermediary server.

```

### Common reasons for using a proxy:

- **Security**: Proxies can filter malicious content
- **Access control**: Organizations can restrict access to certain websites
- **Privacy**: Your direct IP address is hidden from websites you visit
- **Caching**: Proxies can cache frequently accessed content to improve speed
- **Bypassing geo-restrictions**: Access content that might be restricted in your region

## Environment Variables for Proxy Settings

The most universal way to configure proxy settings in Debian is through environment variables. These variables are used by most applications to determine how to connect to the internet.

### Main Proxy Environment Variables

```bash
# HTTP proxy
export http_proxy="http://proxy.example.com:8080"

# HTTPS proxy
export https_proxy="http://proxy.example.com:8080"

# FTP proxy
export ftp_proxy="http://proxy.example.com:8080"

# No proxy - domains that should bypass the proxy
export no_proxy="localhost,127.0.0.1,local.home"
```

### Setting Proxy Variables Temporarily

To set proxy settings for your current terminal session only:

```bash
export http_proxy="http://proxy.example.com:8080"
export https_proxy="http://proxy.example.com:8080"
```

You can verify the settings are active by echoing the variables:

```bash
echo $http_proxy
```

Output:
```
http://proxy.example.com:8080
```

### Setting Proxy Variables Permanently

To make proxy settings permanent for a user, add the export commands to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.profile` file:

```bash
# Open your profile file
nano ~/.profile

# Add these lines to the file
export http_proxy="http://proxy.example.com:8080"
export https_proxy="http://proxy.example.com:8080"
export ftp_proxy="http://proxy.example.com:8080"
export no_proxy="localhost,127.0.0.1,local.home"

# Save and close the file (Ctrl+O, Enter, Ctrl+X)
```

Apply the changes immediately:

```bash
source ~/.profile
```

For system-wide proxy settings, you can add these export commands to `/etc/environment` or create a file in `/etc/profile.d/`:

```bash
# Create a proxy settings file
sudo nano /etc/profile.d/proxy.sh

# Add proxy settings
export http_proxy="http://proxy.example.com:8080"
export https_proxy="http://proxy.example.com:8080"
export ftp_proxy="http://proxy.example.com:8080"
export no_proxy="localhost,127.0.0.1,local.home"

# Save and make it executable
sudo chmod +x /etc/profile.d/proxy.sh
```

## Authentication with Proxy Servers

If your proxy requires authentication, include the username and password in the URL:

```bash
export http_proxy="http://username:password@proxy.example.com:8080"
export https_proxy="http://username:password@proxy.example.com:8080"
```

**Note**: Storing passwords in plain text files is a security risk. Consider using a more secure method for sensitive environments.

## Configuring APT to Use a Proxy

The Advanced Package Tool (APT) is Debian's package management system. You can configure it to use a proxy in several ways:

### Method 1: Using apt.conf

Create or edit the `apt.conf` file:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/apt/apt.conf
```

Add the following lines:

```
Acquire::http::Proxy "http://proxy.example.com:8080";
Acquire::https::Proxy "http://proxy.example.com:8080";
```

### Method 2: Using apt.conf.d directory

Create a new file in the apt.conf.d directory:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/90proxy
```

Add the proxy configuration:

```
Acquire::http::Proxy "http://proxy.example.com:8080";
Acquire::https::Proxy "http://proxy.example.com:8080";
```

### Method 3: Temporary APT proxy for a single command

You can also set a proxy for a single APT command:

```bash
sudo apt-get -o Acquire::http::Proxy="http://proxy.example.com:8080" update
```

## Configuring Git to Use a Proxy

If you use Git on your Debian system, you can configure it to use a proxy:

```bash
# For HTTP
git config --global http.proxy http://proxy.example.com:8080

# For HTTPS
git config --global https.proxy http://proxy.example.com:8080
```

To verify the settings:

```bash
git config --get http.proxy
```

Output:
```
http://proxy.example.com:8080
```

To remove the proxy settings:

```bash
git config --global --unset http.proxy
git config --global --unset https.proxy
```

## Configuring wget to Use a Proxy

The file `~/.wgetrc` can be used to configure proxy settings for wget:

```bash
# Create or edit .wgetrc
nano ~/.wgetrc

# Add these lines
http_proxy = http://proxy.example.com:8080
https_proxy = http://proxy.example.com:8080
```

## Configuring cURL to Use a Proxy

For cURL, you can set proxy settings in the `~/.curlrc` file:

```bash
# Create or edit .curlrc
nano ~/.curlrc

# Add proxy configuration
proxy = "http://proxy.example.com:8080"
```

## Using Desktop Environment Proxy Settings

If you're using a desktop environment like GNOME or KDE, you can also configure proxy settings through the GUI:

### GNOME Desktop Environment

1. Go to Settings > Network
2. Click on Network Proxy
3. Choose "Manual" from the dropdown menu
4. Enter your proxy details for HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, and SOCKS
5. Click "Apply"

### KDE Desktop Environment

1. Go to System Settings > Network > Proxy
2. Select "Manual Proxy Configuration"
3. Enter your proxy details
4. Click "Apply"

## Testing Your Proxy Configuration

After setting up your proxy, it's important to test if it's working correctly:

### Using curl to test HTTP proxy:

```bash
curl -I http://www.example.com
```

If configured correctly, you should see a successful HTTP response.

### Check your external IP address:

```bash
curl http://ifconfig.me
```

The output should show the IP address of your proxy server, not your direct connection.

### Testing APT with proxy:

```bash
sudo apt update
```

If the update runs without network errors, your APT proxy configuration is working.

## Troubleshooting Proxy Issues

### Problem: Unable to connect through proxy

**Solution**: Verify proxy address and port:

```bash
ping proxy.example.com
telnet proxy.example.com 8080
```

### Problem: Authentication failures

**Solution**: Double-check username and password in the proxy URL.

### Problem: Some applications still not using proxy

**Solution**: Some applications have their own proxy settings. Check application-specific documentation.

### Problem: Proxy settings work for some protocols but not others

**Solution**: Ensure you've set proxy variables for all required protocols (HTTP, HTTPS, FTP).

## Common Patterns and Best Practices

1. **Use a proxy configuration script**: For complex environments, consider using a script to manage proxy settings.

    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash
    # proxy-on.sh
    export http_proxy="http://proxy.example.com:8080"
    export https_proxy="http://proxy.example.com:8080"
    export ftp_proxy="http://proxy.example.com:8080"
    export no_proxy="localhost,127.0.0.1,local.home"
    echo "Proxy environment variables set."
    ```

    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash
    # proxy-off.sh
    unset http_proxy
    unset https_proxy
    unset ftp_proxy
    unset no_proxy
    echo "Proxy environment variables removed."
    ```

2. **Consider security**: Avoid storing plain-text passwords in proxy URLs when possible. Use environment variables for sensitive information.

3. **Document your settings**: Keep track of your proxy configuration for future reference.
