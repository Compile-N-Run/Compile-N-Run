### Example 2: Bulk File Operations

Scenario: You need to organize photos from a recent trip.

1. Navigate to your Downloads folder where the photos are
2. Use search (`Ctrl+F`) to find all image files: `*.jpg OR *.png`

### Example 3: Working with Archives

To create and extract archive files:

Creating a zip archive:

Extracting an archive:
1. Right-click on the archive file
