# Ubuntu Virtual Machines

## Introduction

Virtual machines (VMs) provide a way to run multiple operating systems on a single physical computer. They create isolated environments where you can install and run different operating systems without affecting your main system. Ubuntu, being one of the most popular Linux distributions, is an excellent choice for virtualization due to its reliability, performance, and extensive community support.

In this guide, we'll explore how to set up, configure, and use Ubuntu virtual machines for development, testing, and learning purposes. Whether you're a developer wanting to test your applications in different environments, a system administrator managing multiple servers, or simply a curious beginner wanting to explore Ubuntu without installing it directly on your computer, this guide has you covered.

## What Are Virtual Machines?

A virtual machine is a software-based emulation of a physical computer. It runs an operating system and applications just like a physical computer, but exists as a file or set of files on your host machine.

```

### Key Components of Virtualization:

1. **Host System**: The physical computer running the virtualization software
2. **Hypervisor**: Software that creates and manages virtual machines
3. **Guest System**: The operating system running inside the virtual machine
4. **Virtual Hardware**: Emulated hardware components like CPU, RAM, and storage

## Hypervisor Options for Ubuntu VMs

There are several hypervisors you can use to create and run Ubuntu virtual machines:

1. **VirtualBox** - Free, open-source, and works on Windows, macOS, and Linux
2. **VMware Workstation/Player** - Powerful commercial option with a free version available
3. **QEMU/KVM** - Open-source solution built into the Linux kernel
4. **Hyper-V** - Microsoft's solution for Windows
5. **Multipass** - Canonical's lightweight VM manager specifically for Ubuntu

## Getting Started with Ubuntu VMs

Let's walk through setting up an Ubuntu VM using VirtualBox, as it's cross-platform and beginner-friendly.

### Installing VirtualBox

1. Download VirtualBox from the [official website](https://www.virtualbox.org/)

## Sharing Files Between Host and VM

### Using Shared Folders

VirtualBox allows you to share folders between your host and guest systems:

1. Install VirtualBox Guest Additions:
   - In the VM window, click "Devices" > "Insert Guest Additions CD image"
   - Open a terminal in Ubuntu and run:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y build-essential dkms linux-headers-$(uname -r)
cd /media/$USER/VBox_GAs_*
sudo ./VBoxLinuxAdditions.run
sudo reboot
```

2. After rebooting, set up a shared folder:
   - In VirtualBox, select your VM and click "Settings"
   - Go to "Shared Folders"
   - Click the "+" icon
   - Select a folder on your host machine
   - Give it a name and check "Auto-mount" and "Make Permanent"
   - Click "OK"

3. Access the shared folder in Ubuntu:
   - Open File Explorer
   - Navigate to `/media/sf_YourFolderName`
   - If you can't access it, add your user to the `vboxsf` group:

```bash
sudo usermod -aG vboxsf $USER
sudo reboot
```

### Using SSH for File Transfer

You can also use SSH to transfer files:

1. Install OpenSSH server in your Ubuntu VM:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y openssh-server
```

2. Configure port forwarding in VirtualBox:
   - Select your VM and click "Settings"
   - Go to "Network" > "Advanced" > "Port Forwarding"
   - Add a new rule: Protocol TCP, Host Port 2222, Guest Port 22
   - Click "OK"

3. Transfer files using SCP from your host machine:

```bash
# From host to VM
scp -P 2222 file.txt username@localhost:~/destination/

# From VM to host
scp -P 2222 username@localhost:~/file.txt local_destination/
```

## Networking in Ubuntu VMs

VirtualBox offers several networking modes for your VM:

1. **NAT (Network Address Translation)**:
   - Default mode
   - VM can access the internet but isn't directly accessible from the network
   - Uses port forwarding for specific services

2. **Bridged Adapter**:
   - VM appears as a separate device on your network
   - Gets its own IP address
   - Useful for hosting servers that need to be accessible on your network

3. **Host-only Adapter**:
   - Creates a private network between your host and VMs
   - VMs can communicate with each other and the host
   - No direct internet access by default

### Configuring Network in Ubuntu

To check your network configuration in Ubuntu:

```bash
# View network interfaces
ip addr show

# Check internet connectivity
ping -c 4 google.com

# View routing table
ip route
```

To configure static IP in Ubuntu (for bridged or host-only networks):

1. Edit the Netplan configuration:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/netplan/01-netcfg.yaml
```

2. Add a static IP configuration:

```yaml
network:
  version: 2
  renderer: networkd
  ethernets:
    enp0s3:
      addresses:
        - 192.168.1.100/24
      gateway4: 192.168.1.1
      nameservers:
        addresses: [8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4]
```

3. Apply the changes:

```bash
sudo netplan apply
```

## Using Ubuntu VMs for Development

### Setting Up a Development Environment

Let's set up a basic web development environment in our Ubuntu VM:

1. Install essential development tools:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y build-essential git curl wget
```

2. Install Node.js and npm:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_16.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt install -y nodejs
node --version
npm --version
```

3. Install Python development tools:

```bash
sudo apt install -y python3 python3-pip python3-venv
python3 --version
pip3 --version
```

4. Install Docker (for containerization):

```bash
sudo apt install -y apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable"
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y docker-ce
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
sudo systemctl enable docker
sudo systemctl start docker
```

### Creating Isolated Development Environments

One of the key benefits of VMs is the ability to create isolated environments for different projects:

1. Clone your VM for different projects:
   - Shut down your VM
   - Right-click on it in VirtualBox and select "Clone"
   - Give it a new name (e.g., "Ubuntu-Python-Dev")
   - Choose "Full clone"
   - Click "Clone"

2. Take snapshots before major changes:
   - Before installing new software
   - After setting up a working environment
   - Before system upgrades

## Advanced VM Management
