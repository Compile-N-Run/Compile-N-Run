# Ubuntu Environment Variables

## Introduction

Environment variables are dynamic named values that can affect the way running processes behave on a computer. In Ubuntu and other Linux systems, these variables are an essential part of the shell environment and play a crucial role in system configuration and application behavior.

Environment variables serve several important purposes:

- They store system settings
- They control program behavior
- They facilitate communication between processes
- They provide a way to customize your shell experience

In this tutorial, we'll explore what environment variables are, how they work in Ubuntu, and how you can use them effectively in your shell scripts and daily operations.

## Understanding Environment Variables

### What Are Environment Variables?

An environment variable is simply a name-value pair stored in your system's memory. The shell and other programs can access these variables to get information about the environment in which they're running.

Think of environment variables as a way for your operating system to communicate important information to applications and scripts. For example, your system uses environment variables to tell applications:

- Where to find executable files
- What your username is
- Where your home directory is located
- What terminal type you're using
- And much more!

### Key Environment Variables in Ubuntu

Let's look at some of the most common environment variables you'll encounter in Ubuntu:

| Variable | Description |
|----------|------------|
| `HOME` | Contains the path to the current user's home directory |
| `USER` | Contains the currently logged-in username |
| `PATH` | Contains a colon-separated list of directories where the shell looks for commands |
| `PWD` | Contains the present working directory |
| `SHELL` | Contains the path to the current user's shell program |
| `TERM` | Contains the terminal type |
| `LANG` | Contains language and locale settings |
| `PS1` | Contains the primary prompt string |

## Viewing Environment Variables

### Displaying All Environment Variables

To display all environment variables currently set in your shell session, you can use the `env` or `printenv` command:

```bash
env
```

Sample output:

```
SHELL=/bin/bash
PWD=/home/user
LOGNAME=user
HOME=/home/user
LANG=en_US.UTF-8
PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin
...
```

Alternatively, you can use:

```bash
printenv
```

### Viewing a Specific Environment Variable

To view the value of a specific environment variable, you can use the `echo` command with the `$` symbol before the variable name:

```bash
echo $HOME
```

Output:

```
/home/user
```

You can also use the `printenv` command followed by the variable name:

```bash
printenv PATH
```

Output:

```
/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin
```

## Setting Environment Variables

### Temporary Variables (Session Only)

To set an environment variable for the current session only, use the export command:

```bash
export MY_VARIABLE="Hello, Ubuntu!"
```

You can verify it was set correctly:

```bash
echo $MY_VARIABLE
```

Output:

```
Hello, Ubuntu!
```

These variables will only persist for the duration of your current terminal session. Once you close the terminal, they're gone.

### Persistent Environment Variables

To make environment variables persist across terminal sessions and system reboots, you need to add them to shell configuration files.

For user-specific variables, add them to your `.bashrc` or `.profile` file in your home directory:

```bash
echo 'export MY_VARIABLE="Hello, Ubuntu!"' >> ~/.bashrc
```

For system-wide variables that should apply to all users, you can add them to `/etc/environment` or create a new file in the `/etc/profile.d/` directory:

```bash
sudo sh -c 'echo "export GLOBAL_VAR=\"System-wide variable\"" > /etc/profile.d/my_custom_vars.sh'
```

After making changes to these files, you'll need to either restart your terminal or source the file to apply the changes:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

## Working with PATH Variable

The `PATH` variable is particularly important as it tells the shell where to look for executable programs. It contains a colon-separated list of directories.

### Viewing the PATH Variable

```bash
echo $PATH
```

Output:

```
/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin
```

### Adding a Directory to PATH

To add a new directory to your PATH temporarily:

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/your/directory
```

To add it permanently for your user, add this line to your `~/.bashrc` file:

```bash
echo 'export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/your/directory' >> ~/.bashrc
```

Then source the file:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

## Environment Variables in Shell Scripts

Environment variables are extremely useful in shell scripts for configuration and passing data between processes.

### Using Variables in Scripts

Here's a simple script that uses environment variables:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Script to demonstrate environment variables

echo "Hello, $USER!"
echo "Your home directory is: $HOME"
echo "Your current shell is: $SHELL"
echo "Your current directory is: $PWD"

# Using a custom environment variable
echo "Custom variable value: $MY_VARIABLE"
```

Save this as `env_demo.sh`, make it executable with `chmod +x env_demo.sh`, and run it:

```bash
chmod +x env_demo.sh
./env_demo.sh
```

Sample output:

```
Hello, user!
Your home directory is: /home/user
Your current shell is: /bin/bash
Your current directory is: /home/user/scripts
Custom variable value: Hello, Ubuntu!
```

### Local Variables vs. Environment Variables

In shell scripts, there's an important distinction between local variables and environment variables:

- **Local variables** exist only in the current shell or script
- **Environment variables** are inherited by child processes

To demonstrate this difference:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Local variable
LOCAL_VAR="I am local"
echo "Inside parent script: $LOCAL_VAR"

# Environment variable
export ENV_VAR="I am exported"
echo "Inside parent script: $ENV_VAR"

# Run a child script
bash -c 'echo "Inside child process - LOCAL_VAR: $LOCAL_VAR"; echo "Inside child process - ENV_VAR: $ENV_VAR"'
```

Save this as `variable_scope.sh`, make it executable, and run it:

```bash
chmod +x variable_scope.sh
./variable_scope.sh
```

Sample output:

```
Inside parent script: I am local
Inside parent script: I am exported
Inside child process - LOCAL_VAR: 
Inside child process - ENV_VAR: I am exported
```

Notice that `LOCAL_VAR` isn't available in the child process, but `ENV_VAR` is because it was exported.

## Practical Examples

Let's look at some practical applications of environment variables in Ubuntu.

### Example 1: Creating Aliases with Environment Variables

You can use environment variables to create shortcuts to commonly used directories:

```bash
export PROJECTS_DIR="$HOME/projects"
```

Then, in your shell scripts or commands, you can use:

```bash
cd $PROJECTS_DIR
```

### Example 2: Configuring Application Behavior

Many applications use environment variables for configuration. For example, to configure Git with your details:

```bash
export GIT_AUTHOR_NAME="Your Name"
export GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL="your.email@example.com"
```

### Example 3: Building a Custom Prompt

You can customize your bash prompt using the `PS1` environment variable:

```bash
export PS1="\u@\h \[\033[32m\]\w\[\033[33m\]\$(git branch 2>/dev/null | sed -n 's/* \(.*\)/(\1)/p')\[\033[00m\] $ "
```

This will create a custom prompt with your username, hostname, current directory, and git branch (if applicable).

### Example 4: Creating a Simple Logger with Environment Variables

Here's a script that uses an environment variable to control logging verbosity:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# log_message.sh - A simple logging script

# Default to INFO level if LOG_LEVEL is not set
LOG_LEVEL=${LOG_LEVEL:-INFO}

log_debug() {
  if [[ "$LOG_LEVEL" == "DEBUG" ]]; then
    echo "[DEBUG] $1"
  fi
}

log_info() {
  if [[ "$LOG_LEVEL" == "INFO" || "$LOG_LEVEL" == "DEBUG" ]]; then
    echo "[INFO] $1"
  fi
}

log_error() {
  echo "[ERROR] $1"
}

# Main script logic
log_debug "This is a debug message"
log_info "This is an info message"
log_error "This is an error message"
```

Run with default logging level:

```bash
./log_message.sh
```

Output:

```
[INFO] This is an info message
[ERROR] This is an error message
```

Run with DEBUG level:

```bash
LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG ./log_message.sh
```

Output:

```
[DEBUG] This is a debug message
[INFO] This is an info message
[ERROR] This is an error message
```

## Environment Variable Management Tips

### Listing Variables by Prefix

To find all environment variables that start with a specific prefix:

```bash
env | grep "^PREFIX_"
```

### Unsetting Variables

To remove an environment variable:

```bash
unset MY_VARIABLE
```

### Temporary Environment Variables for a Single Command

You can set an environment variable for just a single command:

```bash
MY_VARIABLE="temporary value" my_command
```

### Checking if a Variable Exists

In scripts, you can check if a variable exists and provide a default if it doesn't:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Use a default value if MY_VARIABLE isn't set
MY_SETTING=${MY_VARIABLE:-default_value}

echo "Using setting: $MY_SETTING"
```

## Environment Variables and Security

When working with environment variables, keep these security considerations in mind:

1. **Never store sensitive information** (like passwords or API keys) in environment variables for long-term use
2. Be aware that **any process you launch can access your environment variables**
3. Some system tools might **log environment variables**, potentially exposing sensitive data
4. For sensitive data, consider using more secure alternatives like **keyring services** or **encrypted configuration files**

## Summary

Environment variables are a powerful feature in Ubuntu and other Linux systems that allow you to:

- Configure your shell environment
- Control how applications behave
- Pass information between processes
- Create customized user experiences

Key points to remember:

- Use `export` to set variables for the current session
- Edit configuration files (`~/.bashrc`, `/etc/environment`) for persistent variables
- The `PATH` variable determines where the shell looks for executable files
- Only exported variables are passed to child processes
- Be cautious with sensitive information in environment variables

By mastering environment variables, you'll have much more control over your Ubuntu system and will be able to create more powerful and flexible shell scripts.

## Exercises for Practice

1. Create a script that displays all environment variables containing the word "PATH"
2. Add a custom directory to your PATH and create a simple executable in it
3. Create a script that behaves differently based on a DEBUG environment variable
4. Set up a persistent environment variable that points to a projects folder
5. Write a script that validates whether required environment variables are set
