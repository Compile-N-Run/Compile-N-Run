# Ubuntu Text Processing

## Introduction

Text processing is a fundamental skill for anyone working with Ubuntu or any Linux-based system. It involves manipulating, filtering, and transforming text data using powerful command-line tools. In Ubuntu, text processing allows you to search through files, extract specific information, modify text content, and automate repetitive text-related tasks.

Whether you're a system administrator, developer, data analyst, or just a curious Ubuntu user, mastering text processing will significantly enhance your productivity and problem-solving capabilities in the command line environment.

## Core Text Processing Tools

Ubuntu provides several powerful text processing utilities that form the backbone of text manipulation in the shell. Let's explore the most essential ones:

### 1. grep - Global Regular Expression Print

`grep` is a powerful tool for searching text patterns within files using regular expressions.

#### Basic Usage:

```bash
grep pattern filename
```

#### Examples:

Finding all occurrences of "ubuntu" in a file:

```bash
$ grep "ubuntu" file.txt
Ubuntu is a popular Linux distribution.
Many servers run ubuntu server edition.
Ubuntu Desktop provides a user-friendly interface.
```

Case-insensitive search with `-i` flag:

```bash
$ grep -i "ubuntu" file.txt
Ubuntu is a popular Linux distribution.
Many servers run ubuntu server edition.
Ubuntu Desktop provides a user-friendly interface.
ubuntu repositories contain thousands of packages.
```

Counting occurrences with `-c` flag:

```bash
$ grep -c "ubuntu" file.txt
3
```

Displaying line numbers with `-n` flag:

```bash
$ grep -n "ubuntu" file.txt
1:Ubuntu is a popular Linux distribution.
3:Many servers run ubuntu server edition.
5:Ubuntu Desktop provides a user-friendly interface.
```

Recursive search in directories with `-r` flag:

```bash
$ grep -r "function" /path/to/project/
/path/to/project/script.js:function processData() {
/path/to/project/utils.js:function formatText(text) {
```

### 2. sed - Stream Editor

`sed` is primarily used for text substitution, deletion, and insertion operations.

#### Basic Usage:

```bash
sed 'command' filename
```

#### Examples:

Replacing text:

```bash
$ cat file.txt
Hello World
$ sed 's/World/Ubuntu/' file.txt
Hello Ubuntu
```

Global substitution (all occurrences) with `g` flag:

```bash
$ cat file.txt
Hello World World
$ sed 's/World/Ubuntu/g' file.txt
Hello Ubuntu Ubuntu
```

Deleting specific lines:

```bash
$ cat numbers.txt
1
2
3
4
5
$ sed '3d' numbers.txt
1
2
4
5
```

Deleting a range of lines:

```bash
$ sed '2,4d' numbers.txt
1
5
```

In-place editing with `-i` flag:

```bash
$ sed -i 's/old/new/g' file.txt
```

### 3. awk - Aho, Weinberger, and Kernighan

`awk` is a powerful programming language designed for text processing and typically used as a data extraction and reporting tool.

#### Basic Usage:

```bash
awk 'pattern {action}' filename
```

#### Examples:

Printing specific columns:

```bash
$ cat data.txt
John 85 92
Lisa 93 88
Mike 78 85
$ awk '{print $1, $3}' data.txt
John 92
Lisa 88
Mike 85
```

Computing with columns:

```bash
$ awk '{print $1, $2 + $3}' data.txt
John 177
Lisa 181
Mike 163
```

Filtering rows with conditions:

```bash
$ awk '$2 >= 90 {print $1, "has high score:", $2}' data.txt
Lisa has high score: 93
```

Setting field separator with `-F`:

```bash
$ cat comma_data.csv
John,85,92
Lisa,93,88
Mike,78,85
$ awk -F, '{print $1, $3}' comma_data.csv
John 92
Lisa 88
Mike 85
```

Computing averages:

```bash
$ awk '{sum += $2} END {print "Average:", sum/NR}' data.txt
Average: 85.3333
```

## Text Analysis Tools

Beyond the core tools, Ubuntu offers additional utilities for text analysis:

### 1. sort - Sort Lines of Text

```bash
$ cat fruits.txt
banana
apple
orange
kiwi
$ sort fruits.txt
apple
banana
kiwi
orange
```

Numeric sort with `-n` flag:

```bash
$ cat numbers.txt
10
2
100
5
$ sort -n numbers.txt
2
5
10
100
```

Reverse sorting with `-r` flag:

```bash
$ sort -r fruits.txt
orange
kiwi
banana
apple
```

### 2. uniq - Report or Filter Repeated Lines

```bash
$ cat repeated.txt
apple
apple
banana
orange
orange
orange
$ uniq repeated.txt
apple
banana
orange
```

Counting occurrences with `-c` flag:

```bash
$ uniq -c repeated.txt
      2 apple
      1 banana
      3 orange
```

> **Note**: `uniq` only detects adjacent duplicate lines, so it's commonly used after `sort`.

### 3. wc - Word, Line, Character, and Byte Count

```bash
$ wc file.txt
  5  20 100 file.txt
```

This shows:
- 5 lines
- 20 words
- 100 characters

Counting only lines with `-l`, words with `-w`, or characters with `-c`:

```bash
$ wc -l file.txt
5 file.txt
$ wc -w file.txt
20 file.txt
$ wc -c file.txt
100 file.txt
```

## Advanced Text Processing Techniques

Let's explore some more advanced techniques that combine multiple tools:

### 1. Pipelines

One of the most powerful features in Ubuntu text processing is the ability to chain commands using pipes (`|`):

```bash
$ cat log.txt | grep "ERROR" | sort | uniq -c
      5 ERROR: Failed to connect to database
      2 ERROR: Invalid input parameters
     10 ERROR: Server timeout
```

This pipeline:
1. Reads log.txt
2. Filters only lines containing "ERROR"
3. Sorts the errors
4. Counts unique error occurrences

### 2. Regular Expressions

Regular expressions (regex) enable powerful pattern matching:

```bash
# Find all lines containing email addresses
$ grep -E "[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}" contacts.txt

# Find all lines with phone numbers in format XXX-XXX-XXXX
$ grep -E "[0-9]{3}-[0-9]{3}-[0-9]{4}" contacts.txt
```

### 3. Text Extraction With cut

The `cut` command extracts portions of text from each line:

```bash
$ cat names.csv
John,Doe,35
Jane,Smith,28
Michael,Johnson,42

# Extract first names
$ cut -d ',' -f 1 names.csv
John
Jane
Michael

# Extract first and last names
$ cut -d ',' -f 1,2 names.csv
John,Doe
Jane,Smith
Michael,Johnson
```

### 4. Transforming Data With tr

The `tr` command translates or deletes characters:

```bash
# Convert lowercase to uppercase
$ echo "hello world" | tr 'a-z' 'A-Z'
HELLO WORLD

# Delete specific characters
$ echo "hello world" | tr -d 'aeiou'
hll wrld

# Squeeze repeated characters
$ echo "hello     world" | tr -s ' '
hello world
```

## Real-World Applications

Let's look at some practical examples of text processing in real-world scenarios:

### Example 1: Log Analysis

Analyzing Apache web server logs to find the most common IP addresses:

```bash
$ cat access.log | cut -d ' ' -f 1 | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head -5
    156 192.168.1.105
    142 192.168.1.107
     98 192.168.1.103
     87 192.168.1.115
     65 192.168.1.109
```

This shows the top 5 IP addresses with the number of requests each made.

### Example 2: CSV Data Processing

Processing a CSV file to calculate averages:

```bash
$ cat sales.csv
Region,Product,Sales
North,Widget A,5200
South,Widget A,4800
East,Widget B,6100
West,Widget B,5300
North,Widget B,5800

# Calculate average sales by product
$ grep "Widget A" sales.csv | cut -d ',' -f 3 | awk '{ sum += $1 } END { print "Widget A average:", sum/NR }'
Widget A average: 5000
$ grep "Widget B" sales.csv | cut -d ',' -f 3 | awk '{ sum += $1 } END { print "Widget B average:", sum/NR }'
Widget B average: 5733.33
```

### Example 3: System Monitoring

Monitoring system processes and memory usage:

```bash
# Find top 5 memory-consuming processes
$ ps aux | sort -nrk 4 | head -5

# Count processes by user
$ ps aux | cut -d ' ' -f 1 | sort | uniq -c

# Find zombie processes
$ ps aux | grep 'Z' | grep -v grep
```

### Example 4: Batch File Renaming

Using text processing to rename multiple files:

```bash
# Rename all .txt files to .md
$ for file in *.txt; do mv "$file" "${file%.txt}.md"; done

# Add prefix to all image files
$ for file in *.jpg; do mv "$file" "vacation_$file"; done
```
