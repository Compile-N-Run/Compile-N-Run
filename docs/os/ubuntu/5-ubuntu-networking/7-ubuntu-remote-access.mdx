# Ubuntu Remote Access

## Introduction

Remote access allows you to connect to and control your Ubuntu system from a different location or device. This capability is essential for server administration, working from different locations, and managing headless systems (computers without monitors). In this guide, we'll explore various methods to establish secure remote connections to Ubuntu systems.

Remote access solutions in Ubuntu typically fall into two categories:
- **Command-line access**: Perfect for server management and running commands remotely
- **Graphical access**: Ideal when you need to interact with the Ubuntu desktop environment remotely

## SSH: Secure Shell

SSH (Secure Shell) is the foundation of secure remote access on Ubuntu systems. It provides encrypted command-line access to your system.

### Installing SSH Server

Ubuntu desktop doesn't come with SSH server installed by default. To install it:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install openssh-server
```

After installation, the SSH service should start automatically. You can verify its status with:

```bash
sudo systemctl status ssh
```

Output:
```
● ssh.service - OpenBSD Secure Shell server
     Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/ssh.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)

             └─4313 "sshd: /usr/sbin/sshd -D [listener] 0 of 10-100 startups"
```

### Connecting via SSH

To connect to your Ubuntu system from another computer:

```bash
ssh username@ip_address
```

For example:
```bash
ssh john@192.168.1.100
```

The first time you connect to a server, you'll see a fingerprint verification prompt:

```
The authenticity of host '192.168.1.100 (192.168.1.100)' can't be established.
ED25519 key fingerprint is SHA256:abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz123456789.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])?
```

Type `yes` to continue. This adds the server to your known hosts file.

### Basic SSH Configuration

SSH configuration is stored in `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`. Here are some important settings you might want to change:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

Common configuration changes:

```
# Change the default SSH port (more secure)
Port 2222

# Disable root login
PermitRootLogin no

# Allow specific users only
AllowUsers username1 username2

# Disable password authentication (require key-based auth)
PasswordAuthentication no
```

After making changes, restart the SSH service:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart ssh
```

### SSH Key-Based Authentication

Using SSH keys instead of passwords significantly improves security.

1. Generate SSH keys on your client machine:

```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
```

2. Copy your public key to the server:

```bash
ssh-copy-id username@192.168.1.100
```

Alternatively, you can manually add the key:

```bash
# On your local machine
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
# Copy the output

# On the remote machine
mkdir -p ~/.ssh
nano ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
# Paste the key and save
chmod 700 ~/.ssh
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

3. Now you can connect without a password:

```bash
ssh username@192.168.1.100
```

### SSH Tunneling

SSH tunneling allows you to securely forward network traffic through an encrypted SSH connection.

**Local port forwarding** (access remote service locally):

```bash
ssh -L 8080:localhost:80 username@192.168.1.100
```

This forwards your local port 8080 to port 80 on the remote server. You can access the remote web server by visiting `http://localhost:8080` in your browser.

**Remote port forwarding** (expose local service to remote machine):

```bash
ssh -R 8080:localhost:3000 username@192.168.1.100
```

This makes your local port 3000 accessible on the remote machine at port 8080.

## Remote Desktop Access

When you need graphical access to your Ubuntu desktop, several options are available.

### VNC (Virtual Network Computing)

VNC allows you to share your desktop across the network.

1. Install a VNC server:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install tigervnc-standalone-server
```

2. Set a VNC password:

```bash
vncpasswd
```

3. Create a VNC startup script:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.vnc
nano ~/.vnc/xstartup
```

Add the following content:

```bash
#!/bin/sh
[ -r $HOME/.Xresources ] && xrdb $HOME/.Xresources
startxfce4 &
```

Make it executable:

```bash
chmod +x ~/.vnc/xstartup
```

4. Start the VNC server:

```bash
vncserver -localhost no
```

Output:
```
New 'X' desktop is your_hostname:1

Starting applications specified in /home/username/.vnc/xstartup
Log file is /home/username/.vnc/your_hostname:1.log
```

5. Connect using a VNC client like RealVNC Viewer, TigerVNC, or Remmina from another computer to `ip_address:5901`

For security, it's recommended to use VNC over SSH tunnel:

```bash
# On client machine
ssh -L 5901:localhost:5901 username@192.168.1.100
```

Then connect your VNC client to `localhost:5901`.

### X2Go

X2Go is a more efficient remote desktop solution that works well even on slower connections.

1. Install X2Go server:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install x2goserver x2goserver-xsession
```

2. Install a desktop environment if needed (e.g., XFCE for lighter usage):

```bash
sudo apt install xfce4
```

3. On your client computer, install the X2Go client:
   - For Ubuntu: `sudo apt install x2goclient`
   - For Windows/Mac: Download from [x2go.org](https://wiki.x2go.org/doku.php/download:start)

4. Create a new session in the X2Go client:
   - Host: Your server's IP address
   - Login: Your username
   - Session type: XFCE (or your installed desktop environment)

5. Connect to your remote desktop!

### XRDP (Remote Desktop Protocol)

XRDP provides Remote Desktop Protocol support, making it easy to connect from Windows computers.

1. Install XRDP:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install xrdp
```

2. Start and enable the service:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable --now xrdp
```

3. Check status:

```bash
sudo systemctl status xrdp
```

4. Connect using the Remote Desktop client:
   - On Windows: Use the built-in Remote Desktop Connection app
   - On macOS: Install Microsoft Remote Desktop from the App Store
   - On Linux: Use Remmina or another RDP client

Enter your Ubuntu machine's IP address and your login credentials when prompted.

## Remote File Access

### SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol)

SFTP is built into SSH and provides secure file transfer capabilities.

If SSH is already set up, you can use SFTP without additional configuration:

```bash
sftp username@192.168.1.100
```

Common SFTP commands:
```
pwd               # Print working directory
ls                # List files
cd directory      # Change directory
get file          # Download file
put file          # Upload file
mkdir directory   # Create directory
rm file           # Remove file
exit              # Exit SFTP
```

You can also use graphical SFTP clients like FileZilla by connecting to `sftp://ip_address`.

### Samba (Windows File Sharing)

To share files with Windows computers:

1. Install Samba:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install samba
```

2. Configure Samba:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/samba/smb.conf
```

Add a share at the end of the file:

```
[SharedFolder]
   path = /home/username/shared
   browseable = yes
   read only = no
   create mask = 0755
   directory mask = 0755
```

3. Create a Samba user and password:

```bash
sudo smbpasswd -a username
```

4. Restart Samba:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart smbd
```

5. Access from Windows by typing `\\ip_address` in File Explorer.

## Security Considerations

Remote access inherently introduces security risks. Here are some best practices:

1. **Use strong passwords or key-based authentication**
2. **Change default ports** for services like SSH (22) to reduce automated attacks
3. **Use a firewall** to limit connection attempts:

```bash
sudo ufw allow 22/tcp
sudo ufw enable
```

4. **Implement fail2ban** to block repeated login attempts:

```bash
sudo apt install fail2ban
sudo systemctl enable --now fail2ban
```

5. **Keep your system updated**:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
```

6. **Use VPN** for an additional layer of security when connecting to sensitive systems

## Automation with SSH

### Running Remote Commands

You can run commands on a remote system without logging in:

```bash
ssh username@192.168.1.100 "ls -la /var/log"
```

### Automating File Transfers

Copy files easily with SCP (Secure Copy):

```bash
# Copy local file to remote
scp file.txt username@192.168.1.100:/path/to/destination/

# Copy remote file to local
scp username@192.168.1.100:/path/to/file.txt ./
```

### Creating SSH Config File

Create `~/.ssh/config` for easier connections:

```
Host myserver
    HostName 192.168.1.100
    User username
    Port 22
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```

Then simply connect with:

```bash
ssh myserver
```

## Remote Server Monitoring

### Basic Monitoring Commands

Monitor your system's resources remotely:

```bash
# Check system load
ssh myserver "uptime"

# Check disk space
ssh myserver "df -h"

# Check memory usage
ssh myserver "free -m"

# Check running processes
ssh myserver "ps aux | grep nginx"
```

### Setting Up Remote Monitoring Tools

For more comprehensive monitoring, consider installing tools like:

1. **Netdata** - Real-time performance monitoring:

```bash
ssh myserver "bash <(curl -Ss https://my-netdata.io/kickstart.sh)"
```

Access via: `http://server-ip:19999`

2. **Glances** - System monitoring tool:

```bash
ssh myserver "sudo apt install glances"
ssh -L 61208:localhost:61208 myserver "glances -w"
```

Access via: `http://localhost:61208`

## Remote Access Troubleshooting

### Common SSH Issues

**Connection refused:**
```bash
# Check if SSH service is running
sudo systemctl status ssh

# Verify firewall settings
sudo ufw status

# Check SSH config for errors
sudo sshd -t
```

**Permission denied:**
```bash
# Verify username and password
# Check key permissions
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
chmod 700 ~/.ssh

# Check authorized_keys file
cat ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

### VNC/Remote Desktop Issues

**Black screen or connection issues:**
```bash
# Check if display manager is running
sudo systemctl status lightdm  # or gdm3

# Check VNC server logs
cat ~/.vnc/*.log

# Restart VNC server
vncserver -kill :1
vncserver
```
