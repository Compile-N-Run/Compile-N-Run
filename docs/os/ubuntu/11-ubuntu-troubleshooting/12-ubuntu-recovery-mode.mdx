# Ubuntu Recovery Mode

## Introduction

Ubuntu Recovery Mode is a specialized boot option that provides essential troubleshooting tools when your system encounters problems. Think of it as a "safe mode" that loads a minimal Ubuntu environment with fewer services, allowing you to diagnose and repair issues that prevent normal system operation.

Recovery Mode is particularly useful when:
- Your system won't boot normally
- You need to repair broken packages
- You need to reset a forgotten password
- You need to access a root shell for advanced troubleshooting
- Graphics drivers are causing boot failures
- You need to reconfigure system settings

This guide will walk you through accessing and using Ubuntu Recovery Mode to solve common problems you might encounter as a beginner.

## Accessing Recovery Mode

### Method 1: During Boot (GRUB Menu)

The most common way to access Recovery Mode is through the GRUB boot menu:

1. Start or restart your Ubuntu system
2. When the GRUB menu appears, select the Ubuntu entry with "(recovery mode)" appended
   - If the GRUB menu doesn't appear automatically, press and hold the `Shift` key during boot (for BIOS systems) or `Esc` key (for UEFI systems)

    C --> D[Select Ubuntu with 'recovery mode']
    D --> E[Recovery Menu appears]
```

### Method 2: Forcing GRUB to Appear

If you can't see the GRUB menu, you can force it to appear by modifying GRUB settings:

1. Open Terminal in a working Ubuntu system
2. Edit the GRUB configuration file:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/default/grub
```

3. Find and modify these lines:

```bash
# Comment out this line to always show the menu
# GRUB_TIMEOUT_STYLE=hidden

# Set timeout to a higher value (e.g., 10 seconds)
GRUB_TIMEOUT=10
```

4. Save the file (Ctrl+O, then Enter) and exit (Ctrl+X)
5. Update GRUB configuration:

```bash
sudo update-grub
```

## Using the Recovery Menu

Once you boot into Recovery Mode, you'll see a menu with several options:

### 1. resume - Resume normal boot

This option exits Recovery Mode and continues booting normally.

### 2. clean - Clean up disk space

This option removes unnecessary files to free up disk space, which can be helpful if your system is having issues due to a full disk.

```bash
# What happens behind the scenes:
apt-get clean
```

### 3. dpkg - Repair broken packages

This option repairs broken package installations, which is one of the most common causes of Ubuntu system problems.

```bash
# What happens behind the scenes:
dpkg --configure -a
apt-get update
apt-get -f install
```

Example scenario:
```
Recovery Menu > dpkg

Updating packages...
Fixing broken dependencies...
Setting up package-name (1.2.3-4ubuntu1)...
Processing completed successfully.
Press Enter to continue.
```

### 4. fsck - Check filesystem

This runs a filesystem check to identify and repair disk errors.

```bash
# What happens behind the scenes:
fsck -f /dev/sdaX  # Where X is your root partition
```

Example output:
```
fsck from util-linux 2.36.1
e2fsck 1.46.2 (28-Feb-2021)
/dev/sda1: clean, 123456/7654321 files, 1234567/7654321 blocks
```

### 5. grub - Update GRUB bootloader

This updates your GRUB bootloader configuration, which can resolve boot-related issues.

```bash
# What happens behind the scenes:
update-grub
```

### 6. network - Enable networking

This enables network access in Recovery Mode, which is necessary for options that require internet connectivity.

```bash
# What happens behind the scenes:
service networking start
```

### 7. root - Drop to root shell prompt

This provides access to a root shell for advanced troubleshooting and manual repairs.

```bash
# You'll see something like:
root@ubuntu:~# 
```

### 8. system-summary - System summary

This displays a summary of your system information for diagnostic purposes.

## Common Recovery Tasks

### Resetting a Forgotten Password

If you've forgotten your user password, you can reset it using Recovery Mode:

1. Boot into Recovery Mode
2. Select "root" to get a root shell
3. Enable write access to the file system:

```bash
mount -o remount,rw /
```

4. Reset the password for your user:

```bash
passwd username
```

5. Enter and confirm a new password
6. Type `exit` to return to the recovery menu
7. Select "resume" to continue normal boot

### Fixing Graphics Driver Issues

If you're experiencing black screens or graphics issues after installing drivers:

1. Boot into Recovery Mode
2. Select "root" to get a root shell
3. Enable networking:

```bash
service networking start
```

4. Remove problematic graphics drivers (example for NVIDIA):

```bash
apt-get purge nvidia*
```

5. Reinstall the X server:

```bash
apt-get install --reinstall xserver-xorg
```

6. Reconfigure the X server:

```bash
dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
```

7. Reboot the system:

```bash
reboot
```

### Freeing Disk Space

When your system is low on disk space:

1. Boot into Recovery Mode
2. Select "root" to get a root shell
3. Check disk usage:

```bash
df -h
```

4. Clean package cache:

```bash
apt-get clean
```

5. Remove old kernels (be careful and keep at least one working kernel):

```bash
dpkg --list | grep linux-image
apt-get purge linux-image-x.x.x-xx-generic
```

6. Remove unnecessary packages:

```bash
apt-get autoremove
```

## Advanced Recovery Mode Techniques

### Chroot into Your System

For advanced troubleshooting, you can use "chroot" to work within your installed system from a live USB:

1. Boot from Ubuntu Live USB
2. Open Terminal
3. Mount your system partitions:

```bash
sudo mount /dev/sdaX /mnt  # Replace X with your root partition
sudo mount /dev/sdaY /mnt/boot  # If you have a separate boot partition
sudo mount --bind /dev /mnt/dev
sudo mount --bind /proc /mnt/proc
sudo mount --bind /sys /mnt/sys
```

4. Chroot into your system:

```bash
sudo chroot /mnt
```

5. Perform necessary repairs
6. Exit chroot when done:

```bash
exit
```

### Manually Update Initramfs

If you're experiencing issues with the initial RAM disk:

1. Boot into Recovery Mode
2. Select "root" to get a root shell
3. Enable write access:

```bash
mount -o remount,rw /
```

4. Update initramfs for all kernels:

```bash
update-initramfs -u -k all
```

### Restore GRUB After Windows Overwrites It

If Windows has overwritten your GRUB bootloader:

1. Boot from Ubuntu Live USB
2. Open Terminal
3. Add repository for boot-repair:

```bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:yannubuntu/boot-repair
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install boot-repair
boot-repair
```

4. Click "Recommended repair" in the boot-repair window
