# Ubuntu System Settings

## Introduction

System settings in Ubuntu provide a centralized way to configure and customize your operating system. Whether you're setting up a new installation or fine-tuning your existing setup, understanding how to navigate and modify these settings is essential for any Ubuntu user. This guide will walk you through the most important system settings in Ubuntu, showing you how to access them and explaining what each one does.

## Accessing System Settings

In Ubuntu's GNOME desktop environment, system settings can be accessed in several ways:

1. Click on the system menu (top-right corner) and select "Settings"
2. Press the Super key (Windows key) and type "Settings"
3. Run `gnome-control-center` in the terminal:

```bash
gnome-control-center
```

## Core System Settings Categories

### Wi-Fi and Network

The network settings allow you to connect to and configure wireless networks, VPNs, proxy settings, and more.

**Viewing Network Information**

You can view your current network configuration using the `ifconfig` or `ip` command:

```bash
ip addr show
```

Output example:
```
1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN group default qlen 1000
    link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00
    inet 127.0.0.1/8 scope host lo
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
    inet6 ::1/128 scope host 
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
2: wlp2s0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue state UP group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 00:11:22:33:44:55 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    inet 192.168.1.5/24 brd 192.168.1.255 scope global dynamic noprefixroute wlp2s0
       valid_lft 86398sec preferred_lft 86398sec
    inet6 fe80::42:a8ff:feb4:31e9/64 scope link 
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
```

**Network Configuration Files**

For more advanced configuration, you can edit network settings directly in configuration files:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/netplan/01-network-manager-all.yaml
```

### Bluetooth

The Bluetooth settings allow you to connect peripherals like keyboards, mice, headphones, and speakers. You can also:

- Toggle Bluetooth on/off
- Make your device discoverable
- View paired devices 
- Connect/disconnect devices

For command-line Bluetooth management, you can use the `bluetoothctl` tool:

```bash
bluetoothctl
```

Inside the bluetoothctl interface:
```
power on
agent on
scan on
# Wait for devices to appear
pair 00:11:22:33:44:55
connect 00:11:22:33:44:55
```

### Background

Change your desktop background and lock screen:

- Browse the default wallpapers
- Select custom images 
- Adjust appearance settings

You can also change wallpaper via the terminal:

```bash
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.background picture-uri file:///path/to/image.jpg
```

### Displays

Configure monitor settings, including:

- Resolution
- Orientation (normal, rotated)
- Refresh rate
- Multi-monitor arrangement
- Scale (helpful for HiDPI displays)

**Example: Setting Resolution via Command Line**

```bash
xrandr --output HDMI-1 --mode 1920x1080
```

### Default Applications

Set which applications open for different file types and protocols:

- Web browser
- Email client
- Calendar
- Music player
- Video player
- Photos

Configure default applications via terminal:

```bash
# Set Firefox as default browser
xdg-settings set default-web-browser firefox.desktop
```

### User Accounts

Manage user accounts on your system:

- Add/remove users
- Change passwords
- Configure automatic login
- Change account types (standard vs. administrator)

**Adding a New User via Terminal**

```bash
sudo adduser username
```

**Adding a User to the sudo Group (Admin Rights)**

```bash
sudo usermod -aG sudo username
```

## System Administration Settings

### Date & Time

Configure time settings:

- Set time zone
- Enable/disable automatic time synchronization
- Change date format

**Setting Timezone via Terminal**

```bash
sudo timedatectl set-timezone Europe/London
```

### Software & Updates

This crucial setting panel lets you:

- Check for and install system updates
- Configure update behavior (automatic vs. manual)
- Add or remove software repositories
- Install proprietary drivers

**Updating via Terminal**

```bash
sudo apt update        # Refresh package lists
sudo apt upgrade       # Install available updates
```

### Privacy & Security

Configure privacy settings:

- Screen lock settings
- Location services
- File history & trash
- Diagnostics data

**Setting Automatic Screen Lock via Terminal**

```bash
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.screensaver lock-delay 300
```

### Power Management

Configure power settings:

- Screen brightness
- Screen timeout
- Power button behavior
- Sleep/suspend behavior

**Example: Setting Screen Timeout via Terminal**

```bash
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.session idle-delay 900
```

### Printers

Add and configure printers:

- Add local or network printers
- Share printers on the network
- Set default printer
- Configure printing options

**Adding a Printer via Command Line**

```bash
sudo lpadmin -p printer_name -E -v ipp://printer.local/ipp/print -m everywhere
```

## System Information & Resource Monitoring

### About

View system information:

- Ubuntu version
- Hardware details (RAM, CPU, etc.)
- Disk space
- Device name

**Viewing System Information via Terminal**

```bash
# Show Ubuntu version
lsb_release -a

# Show hardware information
sudo lshw

# Show disk space
df -h
```

### System Monitor

To keep track of system resources, Ubuntu provides the System Monitor application. You can also access similar information via terminal:

```bash
# Display process information
top

# Alternative process viewer
htop

# Memory usage
free -h

# Disk usage
du -sh /path/to/directory
```

Example output from `free -h`:
```
              total        used        free      shared  buff/cache   available
Mem:           7.7G        2.1G        3.9G        210M        1.7G        5.1G
Swap:          2.0G          0B        2.0G
```

## Configuring System Settings via Terminal

While the graphical settings app is user-friendly, Ubuntu's command-line interface provides powerful tools for system configuration. For many settings, you can use the `gsettings` tool:

```bash
# List all available schemas
gsettings list-schemas

# List all keys in a schema
gsettings list-keys org.gnome.desktop.interface

# Get the value of a key
gsettings get org.gnome.desktop.interface color-scheme

# Set the value of a key
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface color-scheme 'prefer-dark'
```

## Dconf Editor

For more advanced settings management, you can use the dconf-editor:

```bash
# Install dconf-editor
sudo apt install dconf-editor

# Launch dconf-editor
dconf-editor
```

This provides a hierarchical view of all system settings that can be modified.

## Creating Custom System Settings Profiles

For system administrators who need to configure multiple Ubuntu systems, creating custom configuration profiles can save time:

### Using Ansible for Configuration Management

```yaml
- name: Configure Ubuntu Desktop Settings
  hosts: workstations
  tasks:
    - name: Set dark theme
      dconf:
        key: "/org/gnome/desktop/interface/color-scheme"
        value: "'prefer-dark'"
        
    - name: Set default wallpaper
      dconf:
        key: "/org/gnome/desktop/background/picture-uri"
        value: "'file:///usr/share/backgrounds/company-wallpaper.jpg'"
```

### Creating a Custom Settings Script

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# custom-settings.sh

# Configure system settings
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface color-scheme 'prefer-dark'
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.background picture-uri 'file:///usr/share/backgrounds/wallpaper.jpg'
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.screensaver lock-delay 300

# Configure software sources
sudo add-apt-repository universe
sudo add-apt-repository multiverse

# Install common software
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y firefox vlc gimp
```

This script can be distributed and run on new systems to quickly apply your preferred settings.

## Troubleshooting System Settings

Sometimes, settings may not apply correctly or may cause unexpected behavior. Here are some troubleshooting steps:

1. **Reset specific settings to default**:
   ```bash
   gsettings reset org.gnome.desktop.interface color-scheme
   ```

2. **Reset all GNOME settings**:
   ```bash
   dconf reset -f /org/gnome/
   ```

3. **Check for configuration errors**:
   ```bash
   dconf-editor
   ```
   Look for keys with bold text, which indicates they differ from default values.
